remarkably close for such a long forecasting horizon.

Empirical coverage: The lower quantiles till 35% seem to be overrepresented by around 30%, which means that our model underestimated the probability for low prices. The quantiles around 50–95% seem to be underrepresented which means that our model estimated the likelihood of higher prices too high
