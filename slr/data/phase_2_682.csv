"Narajewski M., Ziel F.",Ensemble forecasting for intraday electricity prices: Simulating trajectories,2020,,"Recent studies concerning the point electricity price forecasting have shown evidence that the hourly German Intraday Continuous Market is weak-form efficient. Therefore, we take a novel, advanced approach to the problem. A probabilistic forecasting of the hourly intraday electricity prices is performed by simulating trajectories in every trading window to receive a realistic ensemble to allow for more efficient intraday trading and redispatch. A generalized additive model is fitted to the price differences with the assumption that they follow a zero-inflated distribution, precisely a mixture of the Dirac and the Student's t-distributions. Moreover, the mixing term is estimated using a high-dimensional logistic regression with lasso penalty. We model the expected value and volatility of the series using i.a. autoregressive and no-trade effects or load, wind and solar generation forecasts and accounting for the non-linearities in e.g. time to maturity. Both the in-sample characteristics and forecasting performance are analysed using a rolling window forecasting study. Multiple versions of the model are compared to several benchmark models and evaluated using probabilistic forecasting measures and significance tests. The study aims to forecast the price distribution in the German Intraday Continuous Market in the last 3 h of trading, but the approach allows for application to other continuous markets, especially in Europe. The results prove superiority of the mixture model over the benchmarks gaining the most from the modelling of the volatility. They also indicate that the introduction of XBID reduced the market volatility. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Continuous-trade markets; Electricity price forecasting; Ensemble forecasting; Generalized additive models; Intraday market; Lasso; Logistic regression; Power markets; Probabilistic forecasting; Scenario simulation; Short-term forecasting; Trajectories; XBID; Zero-inflated distribution,Commerce; Costs; Logistic regression; Mixtures; Solar power generation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Ensemble forecasting; Forecasting performance; Generalized additive model; Market volatility; Probabilistic forecasting; Student's t distribution; Forecasting; electricity; ensemble forecasting; market conditions; performance assessment; price determination; simulation; Europe,4,1,2,2
"Heydari A., Majidi Nezhad M., Pirshayan E., Astiaso Garcia D., Keynia F., De Santoli L.",Short-term electricity price and load forecasting in isolated power grids based on composite neural network and gravitational search optimization algorithm,2020,2,"Electricity price forecasting is a key aspect for market participants to maximize their economic efficiency in deregulated markets. Nevertheless, due to its non-linearity and non-stationarity, the trend of the price is usually complicated to predict. On the other hand, the accuracy of short-term electricity price and load forecasting is fundamental for an efficient management of electric systems. An accurate prediction can benefit future plans and economic operations of the power systems’ operators. In this paper, a new and accurate combined model has been proposed for short-term load forecasting and short-term price forecasting in deregulated power markets. It includes variational mode decomposition, mix data modeling, feature selection, generalized regression neural network and gravitational search algorithm. A mixed data model for the price and load forecast has been considered and integrated with the original signal series of price and load and their decomposition. Throughout this model, the candidate input variables are chosen by a distinct hybrid feature selection. Two reliable electricity markets (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland and Spanish electricity markets) have been used to test the proposed forecasting model and the obtained results have been compared with different valid benchmark prediction models. Lastly, the real load data of Favignana Island's power grid have been considered to test the proposed model. The obtained results pinpointed that the proposed model's precision and stability is higher than in other benchmark forecasting models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price forecasting; Feature selection; Generalized Regression Neural Network; Load forecasting; Optimization algorithm; Power grid management,Deregulation; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Predictive analytics; Deregulated power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Generalized regression neural networks; Gravitational search algorithms; Hybrid feature selections; Short term load forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Spanish electricity markets; Electric load forecasting; algorithm; artificial neural network; benchmarking; electricity generation; electricity supply; forecasting method; market conditions; nonlinearity; optimization; power plant; precision; prediction; Aegadian Islands; Favignana; Italy; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; Sicily; Trapani; United States,5,2,2,1
"Halužan M., Verbič M., Zorić J.",Performance of alternative electricity price forecasting methods: Findings from the Greek and Hungarian power exchanges,2020,1,"This paper evaluates the performance of alternative algorithms for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. Forecasting performance is assessed based on evidence from the Greek and Hungarian Power Market simulation. The electricity price formation process is simulated on a long time series spanning from January 2015 to September 2018. The EPF models are structured upon the explanatory variables that are available to the market participants before the exchange gate closure, through the publicly available ENTSO-E transparency platform. Relationships between the electricity spot price and explanatory variables are estimated by the selected econometric, data mining, and machine learning algorithms. The econometric autoregressive model with exogeneous explanatory variables is a benchmark model, as the other alternative approaches are used to overcome the linearity bias in the ordinary least squares estimator. We analyse the impact of a different training sample size as well as the impact of training on an hourly clustered sample on the forecasting performance. The support vector machine algorithm turned out to be the best alternative approach, with the lowest mean absolute error and statistically confirmed better forecasts compared to the benchmark econometric autoregressive model. The majority of the tested algorithms perform better with smaller training samples, whereas neural network based approaches prefer large training samples. Models with hourly clustered training samples have higher accuracy based on the Hungarian evidence, while hourly non-clustered training is a superior training method based on the Greek findings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial neural networks; Data mining; Electricity price forecasting; ENTSOE-E transparency platform; Greek power exchange; Hungarian power exchange; Learning sample size; Machine learning; Rolling-window,Data mining; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Power quality; Sampling; Support vector machines; Alternative algorithms; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Forecasting performance; Network-based approach; Ordinary least squares estimators; Power market simulation; Support vector machine algorithm; Power markets; accuracy assessment; algorithm; alternative energy; artificial neural network; econometrics; error analysis; machine learning; numerical model; performance assessment; support vector machine; time series; vector autoregression; Alfold; Hungary,5,1,2,1
"Lisi F., Shah I.",Forecasting next-day electricity demand and prices based on functional models,2020,,"Efficient modeling and forecasting of electricity demand and prices is an important issue in competitive electricity markets. This work investigates the forecasting performance of several models for the 1-day-ahead prediction of demand and prices on four electricity markets (APX Power-UK, Nord Pool, PJM and IPEX). All the models are based on two steps: a nonparametric estimation of some deterministic components, followed by the choice of a suitable model for the residual stochastic component. This latter step includes univariate and multivariate as well as parametric and nonparametric models, with particular emphasis on the functional approach, that models the whole daily profile as a single functional observation. More specifically, the models involved are: a linear model and a nonlinear (nonparametric) autoregressive model, a vector autoregressive model and four autoregressive functional specifications. Prediction covers a whole year. Comparisons are based both on descriptive statistics and on statistical tests of equal forecasting accuracy. Though results partly depend on specific markets, a double functional model always proved to be the best- or no different from the best-model, highlighting the effectiveness of the functional approach. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","APX, NP, IPEX, PJM; Electricity demand forecasting; Electricity prices forecasting; Functional models; Nonparametric models","Commerce; Costs; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; APX, NP, IPEX, PJM; Electricity demand forecasting; Electricity prices forecasting; Functional model; Non-parametric model; Power markets",4,1,2,2

This paper proposes a self-adaptive, decomposed, heterogeneous, and ensemble learning model for short-term electricity price forecasting one, two, and three-months-ahead in the Brazilian market. Exogenous variables, such as supply, lagged prices and demand are considered as inputs signals of the forecasting model. Firstly, the coyote optimization algorithm is adopted to tune the hyperparameters of complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition in the pre-processing phase. Next, three machine learning models, including extreme learning machine, gradient boosting machine, and support vector regression models, as well as Gaussian process, are designed with the intent of handling the components obtained through the signal decomposition approach with focus on time series forecasting. The individual forecasting models are directly integrated in order to obtain the final forecasting prices one to three-months-ahead. In this case, a grid of forecasting models is obtained. The best forecasting model is the one that has better generalization out-of-sample. The empirical results show the efficiency of the proposed model. Additionally, it can achieve forecasting errors lower than 4.2% in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error. The ranking of importance of the variables, from the smallest to the largest is, lagged prices, demand, and supply. This paper provided useful insights for multi-step-ahead forecasting in the electrical market, once the proposed model can enhance forecasting accuracy and stability. © 2020 by the authors.

"Zhang Y., Deng C., Zhao R., leto S.",A novel integrated price and load forecasting method in smart grid environment based on multi-level structure,2020,,"Prediction of load and price are two critical key in power system planning and operation. Most of the recent works in this area forecast the load and price signals separately but, a dynamic model in smart grid is evaluated while, the customers may have opportunity to react the proposed prices changing through shifting the electricity usages from expensive to cheaper hours. So, the load and price signals are coupled strongly which made the previous prediction models ineffective. In this research, a synthetic prediction approach has been proposed by considering the load and price signals, simultaneously. This method works as multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model based on least square support vector machine (LSSVM) forecast engine. Furthermore, a dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) is suggested in this approach to decompose the original signal into different small sub-signals. Beside of that, the modified mutual information (MMI) filter has been used to choose the best candidate input of forecast engine. The learning section is also coupled with novel modified optimization algorithm based on gravitational search algorithm (GSA) which called as modified GSA (MGSA). Finally, various forecasting errors have been considered as average mean absolute percentage error and error variance to get the comparison outcomes and performance of forecasting approaches. For this purpose, different markets have been considered as test case to show the efficiency of suggested approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",DWT; Feature selection; Load and price prediction; LSSVM; MIMO model; Smart grids,Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission networks; Engines; Errors; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; MIMO systems; Predictive analytics; Signal processing; Smart power grids; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Dyadic wavelet transform; Gravitational search algorithm (GSA); Least square support vector machines; Mean absolute percentage error; Multi-input-multi-output models; Optimization algorithms; Power system planning and operation; Price and load forecasting; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1
"Motamedi Sedeh O., Ostadi B.",Optimization of bidding strategy in the day-ahead market by consideration of seasonality trend of the market spot price,2020,,"Due to the liberalization of the electricity market, evaluation of competitor behaviors, as an uncertainty factor, is a critical information for a Generation Company (GenCo) to maximize its profit by optimizing bidding strategies. In this paper, a new bidding strategy model has been presented based on the Genetic Algorithm and a refined Monte Carlo simulation model. This process is done through the similarity function and consideration of the seasonality trend as the main characteristic of the electricity spot price. The main contributions of this paper include: (a): Consideration of the similarity value for all days in historical dates in the database, (b): Consideration of the seasonality trend of market clearing price by applying K-Means algorithm for clustering historical data based on demand, (c): Application of the proposed model for each cluster's data, (d): Performance evaluation of the fitness function of each generated strategy by a simulation model based on historical data. The proposed model has been tested for the 10 subsets of Iran's electricity market 2016.

"Fu T., Zhang S., Wang C.",Application and research for electricity price forecasting system based on multi-objective optimization and sub-models selection strategy,2020,,"In general, electricity prices reflect the cost to build, finance, maintain, and operate power plants and the electricity grid. Therefore, the cost-optimized scheduling of industrial loads with accurate price forecasts is very important. As such, recent studies have attempted to combine models to forecast electricity prices more accurately. Earlier combined models have tended to ignore the selection of sub-models and data analyses, leading to poor forecasting performance. In order to select the best forecasting models in a combined model, we propose a hybrid electricity price forecasting system that includes a data analysis module, a sub-model selection strategy module, optimized forecasting processing, and a model evaluation module. As such, the hybrid system fully exploits the advantages of a single model, thus improving the forecasting performance of the combined model. The experimental results show that the proposed system selects optimal sub-models effectively and successfully identifies future trend changes in the electricity price. Thus, the system can be an effective tool in the planning and implementation of smart grids. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Combined model; Electricity prices; Hybrid forecasting system; Sub-models selection strategy,Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Multiobjective optimization; Power plants; Electricity grids; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting models; Forecasting performance; Industrial loads; Model evaluation; Price forecasts; Power markets,5,1,1,1
Marcjasz G.,Forecasting electricity prices using deep neural networks: A robust hyper-parameter selection scheme,2020,1,"Deep neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity. However, their application requires setting multiple hyper-parameters, and the performance relies strongly on this choice. We address this issue and propose a robust ex-ante hyper-parameter selection procedure for the day-ahead electricity price forecasting that, when used jointly with a tested forecast averaging scheme, yields high performance throughout three-year long out-of-sample test periods in two distinct markets. Being based on a grid search with models evaluated on long samples, the methodology mitigates the noise induced by local optimization. Forecast averaging across calibration window lengths and hyper-parameter sets allows the proposed methodology to outperform a parameter-rich least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-estimated model and a deep neural network (DNN) with non-optimized hyper-parameters in terms of the mean absolute forecast error. © 2020 by the author.

"Zheng K., Wang Y., Liu K., Chen Q.",Locational Marginal Price Forecasting: A Componential and Ensemble Approach,2020,1,"Short-term locational marginal price (LMP) forecasting is the traditional problem of market participants and other institutions maximizing their profit. Most electricity market organizers in the world release the data of LMP along with its three components, i.e., the energy, congestion, and loss components. The series of the three components have their own patterns and driving factors, and can be utilized to improve the accuracy of LMP forecasting. However, most existing studies have focused on direct LMP forecasting and have barely noticed this characteristic. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between the released data of the three components and LMP forecasting through a componential and ensemble approach. Three individual forecasting models are selected and trained for these components, and an ensemble framework that stacks the summation LMP results and the direct results is proposed to enhance the overall accuracy and robustness.

We use a likelihood-free implicit generative model based on an ensemble of point forecasting models to generate multivariate electricity price scenarios with a coherent dependency structure as a representation of the joint predictive distribution. Our ensemble post-processing method outperforms well-established model combination benchmarks. This is demonstrated on a data set from the German day-Ahead market.

"MacIejowska K., Uniejewski B., Serafin T.",PCA forecast averaging - Predicting day-ahead and intraday electricity prices,2020,,"Recently, the development in combining point forecasts of electricity prices obtained with different length of calibration windows have provided an extremely efficient and simple tool for improving predictive accuracy. However, the proposed methods are strongly dependent on expert knowledge and may not be directly transferred from one to another model or market. Hence, we consider a novel extension and propose to use principal component analysis (PCA) to automate the procedure of averaging over a rich pool of predictions. We apply PCA to a panel of over 650 point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows length. The robustness of the approach is evaluated with three different forecasting tasks, i.e., forecasting day-ahead prices, forecasting intraday ID3 prices one day in advance, and finally very short term forecasting of ID3 prices (i.e., six hours before delivery). The empirical results are compared using the Mean Absolute Error measure and Giacomini and White test for conditional predictive ability (CPA). The results indicate that PCA averaging not only yields significantly more accurate forecasts than individual predictions but also outperforms other forecast averaging schemes. © 2020 by the authors.",Day-ahead market; Decision-making; Electricity price forecasting; EPF; Forecast averaging; Intraday market; Principal component analysis,Calibration; Costs; Day-ahead prices; Electricity prices; Expert knowledge; Individual prediction; Mean absolute error; Predictive abilities; Predictive accuracy; Very short term forecasting; Forecasting,5,1,"1, 3",1

"Gulay E., Duru O.",Hybrid modeling in the predictive analytics of energy systems and prices,2020,,"The aim of this paper is to illustrate the nature of the residuals of a forecasting process and to propose a hybrid approach with linear and nonlinear components predicted by corresponding methodologies. It is a common practice that residuals are assumed to be unpredictable or are reiterated into a model as lagged variables to capture any information remaining in the residual data. The central argument of this paper is that residuals from energy price forecasting can still carry predictive information in its complex and nonlinear form. Although the linear modeling is initially very accurate, reiterating residuals in linear structures is a mismatch of data type and methodology. In this regard, the proposed algorithm hybridizes or combines linear components captured by the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) and nonlinear components processed by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve post-sample accuracy. The conventional reiterative process can improve in-sample accuracy, which literally has no value for business forecasting practices. Through a fair benchmark comparison, including methodologies of other combinations, the proposed algorithm is cross-validated by predictive accuracy gain in the out-of-sample (holdout) dataset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Combination forecasting; Energy markets; Energy prices; Price discovery; Price forecasting; Residual modeling,Costs; Forecasting; Neural networks; Signal processing; Autoregressive distributed lag models; Benchmark comparison; Business forecasting; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Linear components; Nonlinear components; Predictive accuracy; Predictive information; Predictive analytics; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial neural network; data set; energy market; forecasting method,"4, 5",2,1,1

Considering all the potent factors in determining the electricity prices - some of which have stochastic nature - makes this a cumbersome task. In this article, first, Grey correlation analysis is applied to select the effective parameters in EPF problem and eliminate redundant factors based on low correlation grades. Then, a deep neural network with stacked denoising auto-encoders has been utilized to denoise data sets from different sources individually. After that, to detect the main features of the input data and putting aside the unnecessary features, dimension reduction process is implemented. Finally, the rough structure artificial neural network (ANN) has been executed to forecast the day-ahead electricity price. The proposed method is implemented on the data of Ontario, Canada, and the forecasted results are compared with different structures of ANN, support vector machine, long short-term memory - benchmarking methods in this field - and forecasting data reported by independent electricity system operator (IESO) to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

"Wang J., Yang W., Du P., Niu T.",Outlier-robust hybrid electricity price forecasting model for electricity market management,2020,5,"Electricity market management is of great importance for cleaner production in the development of society. However, despite this significance, electricity price forecasting remains a challenging task. Hybrid models are widely employed for forecasting electricity price, which has the characteristics of being non-stationarity, random, and non-linear. Despite their success, current hybrid models require improvement. In particular, data preprocessing, artificial intelligence optimization, feature selection, and basic forecasting engine selection should be considered. In this study, in addition to these issues, we consider the negative influence of outliers on the modeling of electricity price. In particular, a novel outlier-robust hybrid model is developed for forecasting electricity price, which combines a basic forecasting engine called outlier-robust extreme learning machine model and three new algorithms. Specifically, a new optimizer called chaotic sine cosine algorithm is developed to obtain the ideal parameters for phase space reconstruction, and then a novel feature selection method is developed to construct the optimal features in the modeling of electricity price. Moreover, an effective data preprocessing method is proposed for effective forecasting by capturing electricity price features. Subsequently, experiments based on electricity price data from the electricity markets of Australia and Singapore demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to other benchmark models. Further, the model can be a reliable forecasting method not only in electricity market management, but also in modeling time series with complex nonlinear characteristics and outliers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity market; Electricity price; Hybrid model; Multi-step forecasting,Commerce; Electric industry; Engines; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Machine learning; Phase space methods; Pollution control; Statistics; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Extreme learning machine; Feature selection methods; Hybrid model; Multi-step forecasting; Nonlinear characteristics; Phase space reconstruction; Power markets,"4, 5",2,1,1

In this study, a prototype asymmetric‐based neuro‐fuzzy network (AGFINN) architecture has been implemented for short‐term electricity prices forecasting for ISO New England market. AGFINN framework has been designed through two different defuzzification schemes. Fuzzy clustering has been explored as an initial step for defining the fuzzy rules while an asymmetric Gaussian membership function has been utilized in the fuzzification part of the model. Results related to the minimum and maximum electricity prices for ISO New England, emphasize the superiority of the proposed model over well‐established learning‐based models. © 2020 by the authors.",Clustering; Day‐ahead electricity price forecasting; Neural networks; Neurofuzzy systems; Prediction,Costs; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Membership functions; Network architecture; Neural networks; Risk management; Asymmetric Gaussian membership functions; Clustering; Defuzzification scheme; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices forecasting; Generation companies; Neuro-fuzzy architectures; Neurofuzzy system; Power markets,5,1,1,1

First, a method for selecting electricity price similarity based on comprehensive influencing factors is designed to select the forecast data set with similar characteristics to the forecast date. The similar daily quantile regression algorithm is then combined with the generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network to construct a quantile neural network electricity price model for obtaining the predicted daily electricity price condition quantile. Finally, the kernel density function is used to convert the predicted daily electricity price condition quantile into the predicted probability density curve to realize short-term electricity price probability prediction. The data of the electricity market of the city of Dayton, Ohio in the United States is used as an example. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of short-term electricity price forecasting. © 2020, The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.",Electricity market; Probability forecasting; Quantile neural network model; Short-term price forecasting,Electric industry; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Probability density function; Competitive power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price model; Generalized dynamic fuzzy neural networks; Neural network model; Probability density curve; Probability forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Power markets,5,1,1,2
"Yang W., Wang J., Niu T., Du P.",A novel system for multi-step electricity price forecasting for electricity market management,2020,9,"Electricity price forecasting is an important and challenging issue for all participants in the power market because of the wide application of electricity in our society and its inherent features. In this context, some current forecasting systems use data preprocessing and optimization for theoretical and practical achievements. However, some limitations to these systems exist which need to be urgently solved. First, future information is overdrawn in the data preprocessing stage of these forecasting systems, which is actually unknown in practical applications. The crucial question, therefore, is how to develop a forecasting system without using any future information. Second, the complex features of original nonlinear and nonstationary electricity price have a negative influence on the generalization ability of these previously developed models. To decrease the negative effects on management, a method to develop a forecasting system to improve the model's generalization ability is required. Therefore, in this study, we developed an adaptive deterministic and probabilistic interval forecasting system for multi-step electricity price forecasting, which can present more valuable information to power market decision makers. Two cases and one comparative study are provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the developed system in multi-step electricity price forecasting. Furthermore, further discussions are presented to illustrate the significance of this study, thus proving that the results of the present study fill the present knowledge gap and provide some new future directions for related studies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Deterministic forecasting; Electricity market; Electricity price; Interval forecasting; Multi-step forecasting,Commerce; Decision making; Electric industry; Forecasting; Comparative studies; Deterministic forecasting; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting system; Generalization ability; Interval forecasting; Multi-step forecasting; Power markets,5,1,1,2
"Shah I., Lisi F.",Forecasting of electricity price through a functional prediction of sale and purchase curves,2020,4,"This work proposes a new approach for the prediction of the electricity price based on forecasting aggregated purchase and sale curves. The basic idea is to model the hourly purchase and the sale curves, to predict them and to find the intersection of the predicted curves in order to obtain the predicted equilibrium market price and volume. Modeling and forecasting of purchase and sale curves is performed by means of functional data analysis methods. More specifically, parametric (FAR) and nonparametric (NPFAR) functional autoregressive models are considered and compared to some benchmarks. An appealing feature of the functional approach is that, unlike other methods, it provides insights into the sale and purchase mechanism connected with the price and demand formation process and can therefore be used for the optimization of bidding strategies. An application to the Italian electricity market (IPEX) is also provided, showing that NPFAR models lead to a statistically significant improvement in the forecasting accuracy. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",electricity prices; forecasting; functional data; Italian electricity market; sale and purchase curves,Commerce; Electric industry; Power markets; Sales; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Functional approach; Functional autoregressive models; Functional data analysis; Functional datas; Functional predictions; Modeling and forecasting; Forecasting,4,1,1,2
"Bisoi R., Dash P.K., Das P.P.",Short-term electricity price forecasting and classification in smart grids using optimized multikernel extreme learning machine,2020,4,"Short-term electricity price forecasting in deregulated electricity markets has been studied extensively in recent years but without significant reduction in price forecasting errors. Also demand-side management and short-term scheduling operations in smart grids do not require strictly very accurate forecast and can be executed with certain practical price thresholds. This paper, therefore, presents a multikernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) for both short-term electricity price forecasting and classification according to some prespecified price thresholds. The kernel ELM does not require the hidden layer mapping function to be known and produces robust prediction and classification in comparison with the conventional ELM using random weights between the input and hidden layers. Further in the MKELM formulation, the linear combination of the weighted kernels is optimized using vaporization precipitation-based water cycle algorithm (WCA) to produce significantly accurate electricity price prediction and classification. The combination of MKELM and WCA is named as WCA-MKELM in this work. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, three electricity markets, namely PJM, Ontario and New South Wales, are considered for electricity price forecasting and classification producing fairly accurate results. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Electricity price forecasting and classification; Extreme learning machine; Kernel extreme learning machine; Kernel functions; Mutated water cycle algorithm; Price thresholds,Commerce; Deregulation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme learning machine; Kernel function; Price thresholds; Water cycle; Power markets,5,2,1,1

However, this deterministic-based algorithm does not present stable performance owing to the experiential selection of its orders and layers. For determining the selection of WT's orders and layers in U.S. electricity prices forecasting, this paper designs a crossover experiment with 240 schemes of WT parameter selection and forecasts each scheme with stacked autoencoder (SAE) and long short-term memory (LSTM), generating a novel hybrid model WT-SAE-LSTM. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other AI models, such as back propagation neural network et al., in forecasting accuracy. The best performance of WT-SAE-LSTM in residential, commercial, and industrial electricity price cases obtained by five order four layers, five order four layers, and four order seven layers, where the MAPE is 0.8606%, 0.4719%, and 0.4956%, respectively. Additionally, the difference between the proposed forecasting model and the forecasting result of Energy Information Administration (U.S.) is small.

"Huang C.-J., Shen Y., Chen Y.-H., Chen H.-C.",A novel hybrid deep neural network model for short-term electricity price forecasting,2020,,"A Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things is fundamentally an Internet of Things, but focused upon power systems. Being able to predict these prices accurately may help with the identification of customer needs and the effective regulation of the power grid by power producers. It may also help electric power traders to manage risks, make correct decisions, and obtain more benefits. In this paper, a novel hybrid model is proposed for short-term electricity price prediction. The model consists of three algorithms: Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD); a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). This is called SEPNet for convenience. The annual electricity price data is divided into seasons because of seasonal differences in the time series of electricity prices. The VMD algorithm is used to decompose the complex time series of electricity prices into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different center frequencies. The CNN is used to further extract the time-domain features for all the intrinsic model functions in the VMD domain. The GRU is then employed to process and learn the time-domain features extracted by the CNN, leading to the final prediction. A comparison is made with five models, such as LSTM, CNN, VMD-CNN, BP, VMD-ELMAN. The results showed that the proposed model had the best performance, and it was found that using VMD can improve the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the four seasons by 84% and 81%, respectively. The addition of GRU in the SEPNet model further improved the MAPE and RMSE by 19% and 25%, respectively. Including CNN and VMD-CNN, that shows that the proposed model has the best performance. The MAPE and RMSE for the four seasonal averages are 0.730% and 0.453, respectively. This confirms that the SEPNet model has the feasibility and high accuracy to predict short-term electricity prices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",convolutional neural network; electricity price forecasting; gated recurrent unit; intrinsic mode function; variational mode decomposition,Backpropagation; Convolutional neural networks; Costs; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Internet of things; Mean square error; Power markets; Predictive analytics; Time series; Complex time series; Electricity price forecasting; Intrinsic Mode functions; Mean absolute percentage error; Neural network model; Root mean square errors; Seasonal differences; Time domain features; Long short-term memory,5,1,1,1
"Gundu V., Simon S.P.",PSO–LSTM for short term forecast of heterogeneous time series electricity price signals,2020,,"Electricity price forecasting plays an important role in the power system network, in order to promote the decision-making process for power generation and consumption. Long term forecasting is not viable as there is an uncertainty in the forecast due to increasing the integration of renewable sources with the existing grids. Since the behavior of the electricity price time sequence signal is highly non-linear and seasonal, deep neural network is the best model for learning the non-linear behavior within the data and for the purpose of forecasting. Hence this paper proposes an enhanced particle swarm optimization based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model, which is used to forecast the closing price of the Indian Energy Exchange. Particle swarm optimization technique is used to optimize the LSTM network input weights, which in turn minimize the forecast error with reduced architecture.

However, it is very difficult to estimate the electricity energy production in advance and store the rest of the electric energy due to the climate, environment, population and other factors. Based on data preprocessing and artificial intelligence optimization algorithm, this paper introduces a combined forecasting method. The proposed method contains six individual methods, and each individual method has its own usage. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is adopted to reduce noise from the original data; three individual forecasting methods, Jordan neural network, the echo state network, least squares support vector machine, are applied to obtain the intermediate forecasting results; two optimization algorithms, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing, are used to optimize the parameters of the combined model. This paper not only validates the superiority of the combined model compared to the single predictive model through the simulation experiments of power load data and electricity price data. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of the combined power load and electricity price forecast results are 1.14% and 7.58%, respectively, which are higher than the MAPE error of the corresponding single models prediction results. It has also been verified that the process of eliminating noise by the SSA plays a positive role in the accuracy of the combined forecasting model. In addition, two series of experiments on the power load data lead to two very interesting conclusions. One of the conclusions is that as the size of the test data increases, the prediction accuracy of the model decreases; the other is that the predicted result calculated through the optimized combined weight is better than the combined result calculated using the average weight, and the average weight is used. Weighted combination does not improve the prediction accuracy of a single model. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",ESN network; Jordan neural network; LSSVM; Power load and price forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis,Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Particle size analysis; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Simulated annealing; Spectrum analysis; Support vector machines; Combined forecasting; Echo state networks; Jordan neural networks; Least squares support vector machines; Optimization algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Short term electric load; Singular spectrum analysis; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1

"Marcjasz G., Uniejewski B., Weron R.",Beating the naïve-combining lasso with naïve intraday electricity price forecasts,2020,6,"In the last three decades the vast majority of electricity price forecasting (EPF) research has concerned day-ahead markets. However, the rapid expansion of renewable generation-mostly wind and solar-have shifted the focus to intraday markets, which can be used to balance the deviations between positions taken in the day-ahead market and the actual demand and renewable generation. A recent EPF study claims that the German intraday, continuous-time market for hourly products is weak-form efficient, that is, that the best predictor for the so-called ID3-Price index is the most recent transaction price. Here, we undermine this claim and show that we can beat the naïve forecast by combining it with a prediction of a parameter-rich model estimated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We further argue, that that if augmented with timely predictions of fundamental variables for the coming hours, the LASSO-estimated model itself can significantly outperform the naïve forecast. © 2020 by the authors.",Averaging forecasts; Fundamental variables; ID3-Price index; Intraday electricity market; LASSO; Price forecasting; Variable selection,Continuous time systems; Forecasting; Fundamental variables; LASSO; Price forecasting; Price index; Variable selection; Power markets,4,1,2,2

It is influenced by external parameters and it is a complicated function. In this work two neighboring regions in the NordPool market are analyzed to provide day-ahead electrical price forecasting using regression techniques. The characteristics of the NordPool market trading behavior leads to unanticipated price peaks at daily, weekly and annual level. The considered two Nordic regions have different energy generation sources (e.g Norway has controllable hydro power, Denmark has non-controllable wind-power) therefore day-ahead electrical energy price forecasting in deregulated market for these two neighboring countries can impact the energy generation dynamics.

By utilizing the basic properties of the supply-demand matching process performed by grid operators, known as optimal power flow (OPF), we develop a methodology to recover energy market's structure and predict the resulting nodal prices by using only publicly available data, specifically grid-wide generation type mix, system load, and historical prices. Our methodology uses the latest advancements in statistical learning to cope with high-dimensional and sparse real power grid topologies, as well as scarce, public market data, while exploiting structural characteristics of the underlying OPF mechanism. Rigorous validations using the Southwest power pool market data reveal strong correlation between the grid level mix and corresponding market prices, resulting in accurate day-ahead predictions of real-time prices. The proposed approach demonstrates a remarkable proximity to the state-of-the-art industry benchmark, while assuming a fully decentralized, market-participant perspective.

Since electricity load and price have a strong correlation, the forecast accuracy degrades when bidirectional relation of price and load is not considered. Therefore, this paper considers price and load relationship and proposes two Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs (MIMO) Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNNs) models for price and load forecasting. The first proposed model, Efficient Sparse Autoencoder Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with eXogenous inputs (ESAENARX) comprises of feature engineering and forecasting. For feature engineering, we propose ESAE and performed forecasting using existing method NARX. The second proposed model: Differential Evolution Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (DE-RELM) is based on RELM model and the meta-heuristic DE optimization technique. The descriptive and predictive analyses are performed on two well-known electricity markets’ big data, i.e., ISO NE and PJM. The proposed models outperform their sub models and a benchmark model. The refined and informative features extracted by ESAE improve the forecasting accuracy in ESANARX and optimization improves the DE-RELM's accuracy. As compared to cascade Elman network, ESAENARX has reduced MAPE upto 16% for load forecasting, 7% for price forecasting.

The recent introduction of the Seasonal Component AutoRegressive (SCAR) modeling framework has changed this viewpoint. However, this framework is based on linear models estimated using ordinary least squares. This paper shows that considering non-linear autoregressive (NARX) neural network-type models with the same inputs as the corresponding SCAR-type models can lead to yet better performances.

Generally speaking, short term electricity price forecasting is essential for electricity providers to adjust the schedule of production in order to balance consumers' demands and electricity generation. Short term forecasting results are also utilized by market players to decide the timing of purchasing or selling to gain maximized profit.

Electricity is a special commodity that is not storable, so its production and load should always be balanced to maintain a tightly regulated system frequency. Electricity production and load both depend on many factors, such as the weather, temperature, and wind.

Nevertheless, because of the high volatility and uncertainty, it is an essential challenge to accurately forecast the electricity price. Considering that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are suitable for processing time series data, in this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based forecasting model, BRIM, which splits the state neurons of a regular RNN into two parts: the forward states (using the historical electricity price information) are designed for processing the data in positive time direction and backward states (using the future price information available at inter-connected markets) for the data in negative time direction. Moreover, due to the fact that inter-connected power exchange markets show a common trend for other neighboring markets and can provide signaling information for each other, it is sensible to incorporate and exploit the impact of the neighboring markets on forecasting accuracy of electricity price. Specifically, future electricity prices of the interconnected market are utilized both as input features for forward LSTM and backward LSTM. By testing on day-ahead electricity prices in the European Power Exchange (EPEX), the experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method BRIM in enhancing predictive accuracy in comparison with the various benchmarks, and moreover Diebold-Mariano (DM) shows that the forecast accuracy of BRIM is not equal to other forecasting models, and thus indirectly demonstrates that BRIM statistically significantly outperforms other schemes. © 2019 by the authors.",Bidirectional recurrent neural network; Deep learning; Electricity price forecasting; Market integration,Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Deep learning; Forecasting; Information use; Long short-term memory; System stability; Bidirectional recurrent neural networks; Competitive environment; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Market integration; Power system stability; Power-exchange market; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Power markets,5,1,1,1

"Luo S., Weng Y.",A two-stage supervised learning approach for electricity price forecasting by leveraging different data sources,2019,10,"Over the years, the growing penetration of renewable energy into the electricity market has resulted in a significant change in the electricity market price. This change makes the existing forecasting method prone to error, decreasing the economic benefits. Hence, more precise forecasting methods need to be developed. This paper starts with a survey and benchmark of existing machine learning approaches for forecasting the real-time market (RTM) price. While these methods provide sufficient modeling capability via supervised learning, their accuracy is still limited due to the single data source, e.g., historical price information only. In this paper, a novel two-stage supervised learning approach is proposed by diversifying the data sources such as highly correlated power data. This idea is inspired by the recent load forecasting methods that have shown extremely well performances. Specifically, the proposed two-stage method, namely the rerouted method, learns two types of mapping rules. The first one is the mapping between the historical wind power and the historical price. The second is the forecasting rule for wind generation. Based on the two rules, we forecast the price via the forecasted generation and the first learned mapping between power and price. Additionally, we observed that it is not the more training data the better, leading to our validation steps to quantify the best training intervals for different datasets. We conduct comparisons of numerical results between existing methods and the proposed methods based on datasets from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). For each machine learning step, we examine different learning methods, such as polynomial regression, support vector regression, neural network, and deep neural network.

"Zhnag L., Zou B., Wang H.",A novel combined electricity price forecasting method based on data driven algorithms,2019,,"In the deregulated electricity market, accurate knowledge of electricity price tend helps maximize the profitability of the participants in the electricity market, so electricity price forecasting becomes extremely important. On the basis of not considering the situation of the electricity market itself and many factors affecting the electricity price, the historical load and electricity price are used as inputs to predict the electricity price from the perspective of data driven. The Lasso, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and BP Neural Network methods are used to establish a single algorithmic electricity price model respectively, and then the linear Lasso and nonlinear BP neural network are used to make combined the prediction results of four single algorithmic electricity price models. Finally, the actual electricity price and load data from Queensland are used for simulation. The simulation results show that: (i) Among the four electricity price models, BP neural network model has the highest accuracy, and the average absolute error is 6.034. The Random Forests model has the worst accuracy, with an average absolute error of 9.669.

"Yousefi A., Sianaki O.A., Sharafi D.",Long-Term Electricity Price Forecast Using Machine Learning Techniques,2019,,"Predicting the performance of energy commodities has long been a global priority for researchers and investors in the Energy sector. Large green field and brown field projects (often exceeding 1bn USD) are financed with locked in capital from the start, and typically take decades to return. Despite being one of the most important aspects of investment decision making, the prediction methodologies used widely today are not sophisticated enough to provide accurate insights for the investors. The new approach was proposed in this research to provide data analytics backed analysis for the performance of energy related commodities using innovative feature discovery methods and machine learning tools. In the presented research, a machine learning model was trained to predict the average monthly price of electricity in the next 5 years with focus on the California State energy market. Data points from 2001 to 2017 were collected and 78 data points are considered for analyses to select the highly-correlated features which could potentially affect the electricity price in the medium to long term. An economic case study is undertaken to understand the correlation of the features, and to avoid multicollinearity. In the next step, the selected features are applied into an S-ARIMA time series prediction algorithm. In addition, several feature-based machine learning algorithms are applied to the data and the results analysed and compared to find the effective forcasting approach. The findings demonstrated promising results for three years future price prediction horizon. Further studies are required to get more accurate electricity results beyond three years horizon. © 2019 IEEE.",Clustering; Energy Price Prediction; Feature Correlation Analysis; Machine Learning Algorithms; Random Forests; Time Series Analysis,Clustering algorithms; Data Analytics; Decision making; Decision trees; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Investments; Learning systems; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Smart power grids; Time series analysis; Clustering; Energy prices; Feature correlation; Investment decision making; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Prediction methodology; Random forests; Learning algorithms,"4, 5",3,1,1

The Bayesian approach allows for conducting statistical inference about model parameters, latent volatility, jump times and their sizes. Moreover, the Bayesian forecasting takes into account uncertainty of parameter estimation.

"Chai S., Xu Z., Jia Y.",Conditional Density Forecast of Electricity Price Based on Ensemble ELM and Logistic EMOS,2019,13,"In recent years, probabilistic forecast of electricity price has become of particular interests to market participants as it can effectively model the uncertainties due to competitive market behaviors. Decision makers heavily rely on such forecast to formulate optimal strategies with minimal risk and maximum profits to deal with stochasticity in market and system operation. Different from the widely used volatility models with least square or maximum likelihood techniques in probabilistic forecast of prices, this paper proposes a reliable continuous ranked probability score-oriented predictive density construction strategy for day-ahead electricity prices. The proposed method effectively quantifies the uncertainty involved in extreme learning machine network by applying an ensemble structure and a logistic distribution-based ensemble model output statistics technique. Moreover, an efficient covariance structure directly determined by the empirical correlations of observed probabilistic forecast series is developed to capture the essential temporal interdependence thus to facilitate the operational scenarios' generation. Through validating on the real day-ahead market in Sweden, the proposed hybrid approach proves to provide superior full distributional forecasting skill over the existing approaches. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Density forecasts; ensemble forecasts; marginal clearing price; scenarios generation; uncertainty quantification,Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Density forecast; Ensemble forecasts; Marginal clearing price; Scenarios generation; Uncertainty quantifications; Forecasting,5,1,1,2
"Díaz G., Coto J., Gómez-Aleixandre J.",Prediction and explanation of the formation of the Spanish day-ahead electricity price through machine learning regression,2019,6,"Until recently, detailed information on the power system state to estimate future spot prices by regression analysis was generally restricted to qualified parties. However, to ensure transparency in operation, the Spanish Transmission System Operator has launched an informative web in which a sizable amount of real-time energy-related data can be consulted through a graphical interface. Undoubtedly, this provides the opportunity for non-qualified parties to develop applications and algorithms in which price forecast and maybe knowledge about how price is determined are required. This paper approaches the use of data extracted from that interface with two aims: the prediction of the day-ahead price in a simple way, and the exploration of the influence that the underlying energy drivers have on it. For the prediction we specified a quantile regression model based on Gradient Boosted Regression Trees. It improves the accuracy over multiple linear regression models at the cost of more complexity, and still it has simpler specification and tuning compared to other machine learning approaches. The calculated metrics show that our model produces remarkably low prediction errors when using the median as point prediction method (RMSE = 2.78 €/MWh, MAE = 1.94 €/MWh, and MAPE = 0.059). Interestingly, the quantile regression model also allows to inherently define prediction intervals, with a different interpretation of accuracy. Our results show that on average 90% of times the prediction error will not exceed 6.8 €/MWh. We also implemented a partial dependence analysis on that model. This implementation—as far as we know the first time employed to analyze the formation of electricity prices—has shown to be of significant usefulness in detecting highly non-linear relationships. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Day-ahead electricity price; Gradient boosting regression; Linear regression; Principal components; Quantile regression,Costs; Electric power transmission; Forecasting; Linear regression; Machine learning; Electricity prices; Gradient boosting; Machine learning approaches; Multiple linear regression models; Non-linear relationships; Principal Components; Quantile regression; Transmission system operators; Power markets; electricity; energy market; exploration; machine learning; operations technology; prediction; principal component analysis; regression analysis; Spain,5,1,1,2
"Grossi L., Nan F.","Robust forecasting of electricity prices: Simulations, models and the impact of renewable sources",2019,7,"In this paper a robust approach to modeling electricity spot prices is introduced. Differently from what has been recently done in the literature on electricity price forecasting, where the attention has been mainly drawn by the prediction of spikes, the focus of this contribution is on the robust estimation of nonlinear SETARX models (Self-Exciting Threshold Auto Regressive models with eXogenous regressors). In this way, parameter estimates are not, or very lightly, influenced by the presence of extreme observations and the large majority of prices, which are not spikes, could be better forecasted. A Monte Carlo study is carried out in order to select the best weighting function for Generalized M-estimators of SETAR processes. A robust procedure to select and estimate nonlinear processes for electricity prices is introduced, including robust tests for stationarity and nonlinearity and robust information criteria. The application of the procedure to the Italian electricity market reveals the forecasting superiority of the robust GM-estimator based on the polynomial weighting function with respect to the non-robust Least Squares estimator. Finally, the introduction of generation from renewable sources in the robust estimation of SETARX processes contributes to the improvement of the forecasting ability of the model. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Electricity price; Nonlinear time series; Price forecasting; Robust GM-estimator; Spikes; Threshold models,Forecasting; Power markets; Time series analysis; Electricity prices; Nonlinear time series; Price forecasting; Robust GM-estimator; Spikes; Threshold model; Cost estimating; computer simulation; electricity generation; energy market; estimation method; forecasting method; nonlinearity; numerical model; renewable resource; time series analysis; Italy,4,1,1,1

Electricity prices in the power market exhibits highly non-linear and non-stationary that makes forecasting the electricity prices very difficult. Three major stages are involved in the proposed algorithms to forecast the electricity prices. In stage I, discrete wavelet transform (db4, level 3) is applied for decomposing the prices of electricity data to a set of constitutive for reducing the variation in the prices data. In stage II, ANFIS is used to forecast the electricity prices. KHA has been adopted in updating the various weights in the ANFIS to get better accuracy. The code of the hybrid algorithm has been developed in MATLAB. The proposed Wavelet-KHA-ANFIS has been tested on the real time system.

As a result, traders and practitioners must constantly adapt their strategies and look for support for their decision-making when operating in the market. In many cases, this calls for suitable electricity price forecasting models that can account for relevant aspects for electricity price forecasting. Consequently, fundamental-econometric hybrid approaches have been developed by many authors in the literature, although these have rarely been applied in short-term contexts, where other considerations and issues must be addressed.

To make better use of electric energy, great efforts have been paid by electricity market researchers and practitioners on electricity price forecasting. Long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, performs well in many areas, such as language modeling and speech recognition. However, the performance of applying the LSTM model to process time series and nonlinear regression problems is not so satisfactory. Stochastic gradient-based optimization has core practical importance in many scientific and engineering fields. Adam, a method for efficient stochastic optimization, has combined the advantages of two popular optimization methods: AdaGrad and RMSProp, it makes LSTM model perform even better.

"Naz A., Javed M.U., Javaid N., Saba T., Alhussein M., Aurangzeb K.",Short-term electric load and price forecasting using enhanced extreme learning machine optimization in smart grids,2019,15,"A Smart Grid (SG) is a modernized grid to provide efficient, reliable and economic energy to the consumers. Energy is the most important resource in the world. An efficient energy distribution is required as smart devices are increasing dramatically. The forecasting of electricity consumption is supposed to be a major constituent to enhance the performance of SG. Various learning algorithms have been proposed to solve the forecasting problem. The sole purpose of this work is to predict the price and load efficiently. The first technique is Enhanced Logistic Regression (ELR) and the second technique is Enhanced Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (ERELM). ELR is an enhanced form of Logistic Regression (LR), whereas, ERELM optimizes weights and biases using a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Relief-F and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) are used for feature selection and extraction. On the basis of selected features, classification is performed using ELR. Cross validation is done for ERELM using Monte Carlo and K-Fold methods. The simulations are performed on two different datasets. The first dataset, i.e., UMass Electric Dataset is multi-variate while the second dataset, i.e., UCI Dataset is uni-variate. The first proposed model performed better with UMass Electric Dataset than UCI Dataset and the accuracy of second model is better with UCI than UMass. The prediction accuracy is analyzed on the basis of four different performance metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed techniques are then compared with four benchmark schemes. The comparison is done to verify the adaptivity of the proposed techniques. The simulation results show that the proposed techniques outperformed benchmark schemes. The proposed techniques efficiently increased the prediction accuracy of load and price. However, the computational time is increased in both scenarios. ELR achieved almost 5% better results than Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and almost 3% than LR. While, ERELM achieved almost 6% better results than ELM and almost 5% than RELM. However, the computational time is almost 20% increased with ELR and 50% with ERELM. Scalability is also addressed for the proposed techniques using half-yearly and yearly datasets. Simulation results show that ELR gives 5% better results while, ERELM gives 6% better results when used for yearly dataset. © 2019 by the authors.",CNN; ELR; ERELM; Forecasting; Load; LR; Price; RELM; Smart grid,Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Errors; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Lawrencium; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Loading; Mean square error; Monte Carlo methods; Neural networks; Power markets; Regression analysis; Classification and regression tree; ERELM; Feature selection and extractions; Mean absolute percentage error; Price; Recursive feature elimination; RELM; Smart grid; Smart power grids,5,1,1,1

Hence, this paper presents the development of a day-ahead SMP forecasting model via implementing an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The accuracy of the ANN-based model is improved by including long-term historical data in addition to short-term historical data and by applying the k-fold cross-validation optimization algorithm. The selection of the short-term type input variable applies the Pearson correlation coefficient. Whereas the long-term type input variable is selected by applying the discrete Fréchet distance in conjunction with the information related to the season and type of the day to find the Similar-Days Index. In order to verify the model, the forecasted load and actual SMP for 15 years of historical data are used.

"Ghayekhloo M., Azimi R., Ghofrani M., Menhaj M.B., Shekari E.",A combination approach based on a novel data clustering method and Bayesian recurrent neural network for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets,2019,6,"Electricity price forecasting is an ancillary service that plays a key role for market participants in a deregulated structure. Compared to other commodities, electricity price exhibits higher levels of volatility and uncertainty. This imposes more restrictions on the accuracy of the forecast and leads to significant errors. This paper proposes a hybrid electricity price-forecasting framework with a novel time series data mining method to enhance the feature selection. The proposed method includes clustering, preprocessing and training stages. The proposed data clustering method uses both an enhanced game theoretic approach and neural gas in combination with competitive Hebbian learning to provide a better vector quantization. Six strategies are proposed to enable the non-winning neurons to participate in the learning phase and resolve the shortcomings of the original self-organizing map, where the dead neurons are far from the input patterns without having any chance to compete with the winning neurons. The price-load input data are clustered into a proper number of subsets using the proposed data mining method. A novel cluster selection method based on the persistence approach is applied to select the most appropriate cluster as the input to the BRNN. The selected data set is filtered by the harmonic analysis time series, and is time-series processed to provide the proper inputs for training neural networks. Bayesian approach is used to train a recurrent neural network, and forecast the electricity price. The performance of the proposed clustering algorithm is evaluated using different electricity market data. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed clustering algorithm as compared to K-means, neural gas and self-organizing map clustering methods Our proposed clustering provides 16.7%, 28.6%, and 13% more accurate results than K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map for the NYISO. CAPITL data. For the NYISO. CENTRL data, the developed clustering outperforms the K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map by 21.4%, 21.4%, and 8.3%, respectively. The clustering accuracy of the proposed method for NYISO. DUNWOD data is 5.5%, 19%, and 5.5% better than that of the K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map methods Lastly, for the NYISO.

"Maciejowska K., Nitka W., Weron T.",Day-ahead vs. Intraday—Forecasting the price spread to maximize economic benefits,2019,17,"Recently, a dynamic development of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) has been observed. In order to allow for the adoption of trading contracts for unplanned events and changing weather conditions, the day-ahead markets have been complemented by intraday markets; in some countries, such as Poland, balancing markets are used for this purpose. This research focuses on a small RES generator, which has no market power and sells electricity through a larger trading company. The generator needs to decide, in advance, how much electricity is sold in the day-ahead market. The optimal decision of the generator on where to sell the production depends on the relation between prices in different markets. Unfortunately, when making the decision, the generator is not sure which market will offer a higher price. This article investigates the possible gains from utilizing forecasts of the price spread between the intraday/balancing and day-ahead markets in the decision process. It shows that the sign of the price spread can be successfully predicted with econometric models, such as ARX and probit. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the statistical measures of forecast accuracy, such as the percentage of correct sign classifications, do not necessarily coincide with economic benefits. © 2019 by the authors.",ARX model; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Forecasting; Price spread; Probit model,Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Renewable energy resources; ARX model; Dynamic development; Electricity prices; Forecast accuracy; Price spread; Probit models; Renewable energy source; Statistical measures; Power markets,4,1,"1, 2",1

These data are known as energy big data. The analysis of big data divulges the deeper insights that help experts in the improvement of smart grid's (SG) operations. Processing and extracting of meaningful information from data is a challenging task. Electricity load and price are the most influential factors in the electricity market. For improving reliability, control and management of electricity market operations, an exact estimate of the day ahead load is a substantial requirement. Energy market trade is based on price. Accurate price forecast enables energy market participants to make effective and most profitable bidding strategies. This paper proposes a deep learning-based model for the forecast of price and demand for big data using Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM). Due to the adaptive and automatic feature learning mechanism of Deep Neural Network (DNN), the processing of big data is easier with LSTM as compared to the purely data-driven methods. The proposed model was evaluated using well-known real electricity markets' data. In this study, day and week ahead forecasting experiments were conducted for all months. Forecast performance was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). The proposed Deep LSTM (DLSTM) method was compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) time series forecasting methods, i.e., Nonlinear Autoregressive network with Exogenous variables (NARX) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).

"Cerjan M., Petričić A., Delimar M.",HIRA model for short-term electricity price forecasting,2019,3,"In competitive power markets, electric utilities, power producers, and traders are exposed to increased risks caused by electricity price volatility. The growing reliance on renewable sources and their dependence on weather, nuclear uncertainty, market coupling, and global financial instability are contributing to the importance of accurate electricity price forecasting. Since power markets are not all equally developed, different price forecasting methods have been introduced for individual markets. The aim of this research is to introduce a short-term electricity price forecasting method that addresses the problems of price volatility, a varying number of input parameters, varying data availability, and a large number of parameters and input data. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used on any market as it targets the characteristics and specifics of each market. The proposed Hybrid Iterative Reactive Adaptive (HIRA) method consists of two phases. In analysis phase, fundamental parameters which affect the electricity price are identified depending on market development. Obtained parameters are used as data inputs for price forecasting using a hybrid method. The HIRA model combines a statistical approach for large data set analysis and a similar day method with neural network tools. Similar days are examined using a statistical method which combines correlation significance, price volatility, and forecasting accuracy of the historical data. Data are collected based on their availability and electricity prices are forecasted in several iterations. All relevant data for price forecasting are collected, categorized, and arranged using simple indicators which makes the HIRA model adaptive and reactive to new market circumstances. The proposed model is validated using the Hungarian Power Exchange (HUPX) electricity price data records. The results show that with HIRA model forecasting, the error is stable and does not depend on price volatility. The HIRA method has proven to be applicable for forecasting electricity prices in real-time market conditions and enables effective hedging of price risk in the production or market portfolio. © 2019 by the authors.",Data mining; Dynamic hybrid model; Electricity market; Electricity price; Neural network; Short-term electricity price forecast; Spot market,Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Electric utilities; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Competitive power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price volatilities; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Hybrid model; Spot market; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1

"Yang W., Wang J., Niu T., Du P.",A hybrid forecasting system based on a dual decomposition strategy and multi-objective optimization for electricity price forecasting,2019,48,"Electricity price forecasting plays a crucial role in balancing electricity generation and consumption, which is of great political and economic significance for all of society but is still a challenging task. However, in previous studies, most researchers have focused on improving either forecasting accuracy or stability while ignoring the significance of performing these tasks simultaneously. More importantly, few researchers have deeply studied the data preprocessing strategy, only focusing on the application of individual decomposition approaches. Therefore, a novel hybrid forecasting system based on a dual decomposition strategy and multi-objective optimization is developed for electricity price forecasting that includes four modules: a data preprocessing module, optimization module, forecasting module and evaluation module. In this system, an effective multi-objective optimization algorithm is employed to guarantee simultaneous improvements in accuracy and stability. In addition, an improved data preprocessing approach named the dual decomposition strategy is developed, which successfully overcomes the potential drawback of the individual decomposition approach and further improves the effectiveness of the developed forecasting system. Moreover, the evaluation module is incorporated to verify the superiority of the developed forecasting system. Case studies utilizing half-hourly electricity price data collected from New South Wales, Australia are employed as examples. The results prove the superiority of the multi-objective optimization algorithm and the developed dual decomposition strategy and reveal that the developed forecasting system outperforms all of the considered comparison models, which shows its better ability to forecast future electricity prices with better accuracy and stability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Dual decomposition strategy; Electricity price forecasting system; Forecasting accuracy and stability; Multi-objective optimization algorithm,"Forecasting; Power markets; System stability; Decomposition approach; Dual decomposition; Electricity generation; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Multi-objective optimization algorithms; New South Wales , Australia; Optimization module; Multiobjective optimization; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data processing; decomposition analysis; electricity; electricity generation; forecasting method; optimization; price dynamics; Australia; New South Wales",5,1,1,1

"Wang F., Li K., Zhou L., Ren H., Contreras J., Shafie-khah M., Catalão J.P.S.",Daily pattern prediction based classification modeling approach for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2019,48,"Day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) plays a very important role in the decision-making optimization of electricity market participants, the dispatch control of independent system operators (ISOs) and the strategy formulation of energy trading. Unified modeling that only fits a single mapping relation between the historical data and future data usually produces larger errors because the different fluctuation patterns in electricity price data show different mapping relations. A daily pattern prediction (DPP) based classification modeling approach for DAEPF is proposed to solve this problem. The basic idea is that first recognize the price pattern of the next day from the “rough” day-ahead forecasting results provided by conventional forecasting methods and then perform classification modeling to further improve the forecasting accuracy through building a specific forecasting model for each pattern. The proposed approach consists of four steps. First, K-means is utilized to group all the historical daily electricity price curves into several clusters in order to assign each daily curve a pattern label for the training of the following daily pattern recognition (DPR) model and classification modeling. Second, a DPP model is proposed to recognize the price pattern of the next day from the forecasting results provided by multiple conventional forecasting methods. A weighted voting mechanism (WVM) method is proposed in this step to combine multiple day-ahead pattern predictions to obtain a more accurate DPP result. Third, the classification forecasting model of each different daily pattern can be established according to the clustering results in step 1. Fourth, the credibility of DPP result is checked to eventually determine whether the proposed classification DAEPF modeling approach can be adopted or not. A case study using the real electricity price data from the PJM market indicates that the proposed approach presents a better performance than unified modeling for a certain daily pattern whose DPP results show high reliability and accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Classification modeling; Daily pattern prediction; Day-ahead forecasting; Electricity price; Weighted voting mechanism,Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Decision making; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Mapping; Pattern recognition; Classification models; Day-ahead; Decision-making optimization; Different mapping relation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Independent system operators; Weighted voting; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1
"McHugh C., Coleman S., Kerr D., McGlynn D.",A Linear Polynomial NARMAX Model with Multiple Factors to Forecast Day-Ahead Electricity Prices,2019,1,"Forecasting algorithms are a valuable mechanism to aid in the prediction of future prices. Although various black-box modelling techniques have been applied to variations of this problem, we focus on the use of transparent models to enable understanding and interpretation of the developed model. We utilize a Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous input(NARMAX) for electricity price forecasting using multiple input factors. Energy data from a 14-week period in 2017 were analyzed to determine whether a NARMAX model could accurately predict day-ahead electricity prices and to check which input factors in the model were most significant. The model considered the closely correlated lags and included 13 input factors. There were two models developed in order to determine which variables played an important role in predicting future prices. Experimental results indicate that previous price, demand, gas, coal, and nuclear are the most significant factors that influence electricity prices. Gas was the highest weighted factor for both developed models. Previous price yielded the biggest Error Reduction Ratio(ERR), but when not included in the model, demand generated the biggest ERR value. To summarize a NARMAX model with an input regression lag of one and previous price included generates the best day-ahead forecast of electricity prices. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Energy market; Multiple factors; NARMAX,Artificial intelligence; Composite structures; Costs; Forecasting; Black box modelling; Electricity price forecasting; Energy markets; Error reduction ratios; Forecasting algorithm; Multiple factors; NARMAX; Nonlinear autoregressive moving average models; Power markets,4,1,1,1

Here, we consider two novel extensions of this concept to probabilistic forecasting: one based on Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) applied to a set of point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows, the other on a technique dubbed Quantile Regression Machine (QRM), which first averages these point predictions, then applies quantile regression to the combined forecast. Once computed, we combine the probabilistic forecasts across calibration windows by averaging probabilities of the corresponding predictive distributions. Our results show that QRM is not only computationally more efficient, but also yields significantly more accurate distributional predictions, as measured by the aggregate pinball score and the test of conditional predictive ability. Moreover, combining probabilistic forecasts brings further significant accuracy gains. c 2019 by the authors.",Autoregression; Average probability forecast; Calibration window; Combining forecasts; Conditional predictive ability; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive distribution,Calibration; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Regression analysis; Autoregression; Combining forecasts; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive abilities; Predictive distributions; Probability forecasts; Power markets,4,2,1,2

The forecasting is done for 212 days from the beginning of 2017 and past data from 2016 is used. For forecasting, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Trigonometric Seasonal Box-Cox Transformation with ARMA residuals Trend and Seasonal Components (TBATS) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods are used and seasonal naïve forecast is utilized as a benchmark. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are used as accuracy criterions. ARIMA and ANN are utilized with external variables and variable analysis is realized in order to improve forecasting results. As a result of variable analysis, it was observed that excluding temperature from external variables helped improve forecasting results. In terms of mean error ARIMA yielded the best results while ANN had the lowest minimum error and standard deviation. TBATS performed better than ANN in terms of mean error. To further improve forecasting accuracy, the three forecasts were combined using simple averaging and ANN methods and they were both found to be beneficial, with simple averaging having better accuracy.

"Xiong H., Mamon R.",A higher-order Markov chain-modulated model for electricity spot-price dynamics,2019,6,"Over the last three decades, the electricity sector worldwide underwent massive deregulation. Power market participants have encountered a growing number of challenges due to competition and other pertinent factors. For most markets at present, electricity is a non-storable commodity and its price is extremely sensitive to changes in supply and demand. The evolution of electricity prices exhibits pronounced mean reversion and cyclical patterns, possesses extreme volatility and relatively frequently occurring spikes, and manifests presence of memory property. These observed features necessitate the development of models aimed to simultaneously capture such price characteristics for forecasting, risk management, and valuation of electricity-driven derivatives. Majority of current research studies examining electricity spot prices are based on one-state models. Such models though may not accurately capture the stylised behaviours of price evolution, especially during periods of sudden spikes driven by the abrupt changes of market sentiments. This paper tackles the modelling and estimation problems under a new paradigm that integrates the deterministic calendar seasons and stochastic factors governing electricity prices with a regime-switching feature. The de-seasonalised component of our proposed model has both the jump and mean-reverting properties to account for spikes and periodic cycles alternating between lower price returns and compensating periods of higher price returns. The parameters of the de-seasonalised model components are also modulated by a higher-order hidden Markov chain (HOHMC) in discrete time. This provides a mechanism to extract latent information from historical data. The HOHMC's state is interpreted as the “state of the world” resulting from the interaction of various forces impacting the electricity market. Filters are developed to generate optimal estimates of HOHMC-relevant quantities using the observation process, and these provide online estimates of model parameters. Empirical demonstrations using the daily electricity spot prices, compiled by the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO), show that our HOHMM approach has considerable merits in terms of price data fitting and forecasting metrics. Our proposed framework driven by a hidden Markov chain with a state memory-capturing mechanism provides a powerful alternative to support the pricing of contracts in the electricity markets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Change of reference probability measure; Commodity-derivatives valuation; Energy-price modelling; Finance; Poisson process; Statistical estimation,Chains; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Finance; Markov processes; Risk management; Signal theory; Stochastic systems; Electricity spot price; Energy prices; Hidden Markov chains; Higher-order Markov chains; Market participants; Poisson process; Reference probability; Statistical estimation; Power markets; demand analysis; electricity; energy market; estimation method; financial system; Markov chain; numerical model; Poisson ratio; price dynamics; probability; statistical analysis; stochasticity; Alberta; Canada,3,1,1,1

LSTM network has been widely used in various applications such as natural language processing and time series analysis.

We propose to use LSTM model to forecast the day-ahead electricity price for Australian market at Victoria (VIC) region and Singapore market. Instead of using only historical prices as inputs to the model, we also consider exogenous variables, such as holidays, day of the week, hour of the day, weather conditions, oil prices and historical price/demand, etc. The output is the electricity price for the next hour. The future 24 hours of prices are forecasted in a recursive manner. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of four weeks for each season in VIC and Singapore markets are examined.

A Gaussian Kernel Density Estimator function is used for each input variable, which allows to calculate the parameters of the probability density function (PDF) of a Beta distribution for the hourly price variable. Thus, valuable information is obtained from PDFs such as point forecasts, variance values, quantiles, probabilities of prices, and time series representations of forecast uncertainty. A Reliability Indicator is also introduced to give a measure of “reliability” of forecasts. The Probabilistic Price Forecasting Models were satisfactorily applied to the real-world case study of the Iberian Electricity Market. Input variables of these models include recent prices, power demands and power generations in the previous day, power demands in the previous week, forecasts of demand, wind power generation and weather for the day-ahead, and chronological data. The best model, corresponding to the best combination of input variables that achieves the lowest MAE, obtains one of the highest Reliability Indicator values. A systematic analysis of MAE values of the Probabilistic Price Forecasting Models for different combinations of input variables showed that as more types of input variables were considered in these models, MAE values improved and Reliability Indicator values usually increased. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity prices; Iberian electricity market; Market prices; Probabilistic forecast; Short-term forecasting,Commerce; Cost estimating; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Reliability analysis; Wind power; Electricity prices; Iberian electricity market; Market price; Probabilistic forecasts; Short-term forecasting; Power markets,4,1,1,2

In the present nonlinear problem, linear variation of inertia weight does not resemble exact search process. Hence, dynamic inertia weight is accomplished by implementing the fuzzy systems in the S-PSO approach. The hybrid methodology is implemented on Spanish electricity markets for the year 2002. To validate, three types of price classes and historical price series that are utilized by many researches as input features, are considered. Various statistical indicators are evaluated to compare and validate the proposed approaches with the past approaches available in the literature survey. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",Forecasting; fuzzy systems; neural networks (NN); particle swarm optimization (PSO); wavelet transform (WT),Biological systems; Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Neurons; Power markets; Wavelet transforms; Auto regressive process; Biological system modeling; Computational model; Neural network (nn); Predictive models; Particle swarm optimization (PSO),5,2,1,1

"Paulos J.P., Fidalgo J.N.",Load and electricity prices forecasting using generalized regression neural networks,2018,1,"Over time, the electricity price and energy consumption are increasingly growing their weight as prime foundations of the electrical sector, with their analysis and forecasts being targeted as key elements for the stable maintenance of electricity markets. The advent of smart grids is escalating the importance of forecasting because of the expected ubiquitous monitoring and growing complexity of a data-rich ever-changing milieu. So, the increasing data volatility will require forecasting tools able to rapidly readjust to a dynamic environment. The Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) approach is a solution that has recently re-emerged, emphasizing good performance, fast run-times and ease of parameterization. The merging of this model with more conventional methods allows us to obtain more sturdy solutions with shortened training times, when compared to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Overall, the performance of the GRNN, although slightly inferior to that of the ANN, is suitable, but linked to much lower training times. Ultimately, the GRNN would be a proper solution to blend with the latest smart grids features, which may require much reduced forecasting training times. © 2018 IEEE.",Data sampling; electricity prices forecasting; load forecasting; neural networks; performance evaluation,Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Smart power grids; Conventional methods; Data sampling; Dynamic environments; Electricity prices forecasting; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Generalized regression neural networks; Load forecasting; Performance evaluations; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1

"Ziel F., Steinert R.",Probabilistic mid- and long-term electricity price forecasting,2018,27,"The liberalization of electricity markets and the development of renewable energy sources has led to new challenges for decision makers. These challenges are accompanied by an increasing uncertainty about future electricity price movements. The increasing amount of papers, which aim to model and predict electricity prices for a short period of time provided new opportunities for market participants. However, the electricity price literature seem to be very scarce on the issue of medium- to long-term price forecasting, which is mandatory for investment and political decisions. Our paper closes this gap by introducing a new approach to simulate electricity prices with hourly resolution for several months up to three years. Considering the uncertainty of future events we are able to provide probabilistic forecasts which are able to detect probabilities for price spikes even in the long-run. As market we decided to use the EPEX day-ahead electricity market for Germany and Austria. Our model extends the X-Model which mainly utilizes the sale and purchase curve for electricity day-ahead auctions. By applying our procedure we are able to give probabilities for the due to the EEG practical relevant event of six consecutive hours of negative prices.

Dudek G.,Probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices using kernel regression,2018,1,"Electricity price forecasting has become crucial for energy companies due to its fundamental importance for decision making processes and operational management. Electricity price time series exhibit variable means, significant volatility and spikes, which places high demands on forecasting models. Moreover, in recent years researchers and practitioners have come to understand the limitations of point forecasts and require models to generate probabilistic forecasts. In contrast to point forecasts, the probabilistic forecasts takes the form of a predictive probability distribution over future quantities or events of interest. In the paper the probabilistic forecasting model based on Nadaraya- Watson estimator is proposed. The model generates the point forecasts as 24-component vectors representing day-ahead electricity prices.

"Varshney H., Sujil A., Kumar R.",A Singular Spectrum Analysis based Approach to Price Forecasting for a Day Ahead Electricity Market,2018,1,"Deregulation across various electricity markets created a need for an operational framework that has capability to run similar to the dynamics of real world commodity markets possessing the competitiveness to ensure long run stability, providing opportunity to every participant and maintaining the price level of commodity within the reach of consumer. The electricity framework takes into account the power system balancing constraints required to ensure its reliability and security. This complex structure with its aim of competitiveness motivated the participating entities to run the generating capacities at the optimum level, forced the operators to minimize the transmission losses and created an environment for the consumers to take the benefit of variable pricing conditions. Specially, these effects are reflected via short term electricity price forecasting (STPF) in a significant amount. The STPF created the required decision base for the entities to bid in market with an effective strategy of risk management to hedge against the highly volatile pricing events to ensure the required amount of liquidity and making better economic conditions while in case of large consumers, it helps to either curtail or schedule the loads to minimize the cost of energy. It also helps them to prepare an alternative strategy to make available the required energy via small private generating units during peak price hours. To account for different requirements of various entities, accurate price forecasting is a crucial task. The complexity of the price dynamics also involves the variations attributed to spatial effects in different operating regions such as calamities and extreme conditions.

We provide evidence that despite a minor edge in predictive performance overall, the multivariate modeling framework does not uniformly outperform the univariate one across all 12 considered datasets, seasons of the year or hours of the day, and at times is outperformed by the latter. This is an indication that combining advanced structures or the corresponding forecasts from both modeling approaches can bring a further improvement in forecasting accuracy. We show that this indeed can be the case, even for a simple averaging scheme involving only two models.

First, we propose a deep neural network that considers features from connected markets to improve the predictive accuracy in a local market. To measure the importance of these features, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm that, by using Bayesian optimization and functional analysis of variance, evaluates the effect of the features on the algorithm performance. In addition, using market integration, we propose a second model that, by simultaneously predicting prices from two markets, improves the forecasting accuracy even further. As a case study, we consider the electricity market in Belgium and the improvements in forecasting accuracy when using various French electricity features. We show that the two proposed models lead to improvements that are statistically significant. Particularly, due to market integration, the predictive accuracy is improved from 15.7% to 12.5% sMAPE (symmetric mean absolute percentage error).

"Zhao Z., Wang C., Nokleby M., Miller C.J.",Improving short-term electricity price forecasting using day-ahead LMP with ARIMA models,2018,2,"Short-term electricity price forecasting has become important for demand side management and power generation scheduling. Especially as the electricity market is becomes more competitive, a more accurate price prediction than the day-ahead locational marginal price (DALMP) published by the independent system operator (ISO) will benefit participants in the market by increasing profit or improving load demand scheduling. Hence, the main idea of this paper is to use autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to obtain a better LMP prediction than the DALMP by utilizing the published DALMP, historical real-time LMP (RTLMP) and other useful information. First, a set of seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models utilizing the DALMP and historical RTLMP are developed and compared with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models that use the differences between DALMP and RTLMP on their forecasting capability. A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is implemented to further improve the forecasting by accounting for the price volatility. The models are trained and evaluated using real market data in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region. The evaluation results indicate that the ARMAX-GARCH model, where an exogenous time series indicates weekend days, improves the short-term electricity price prediction accuracy and outperforms the other proposed ARIMA models. © 2017 IEEE.",ARIMA models; Electricity market; Locational marginal price; Price prediction,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Scheduling; ARIMA models; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Autoregressive moving average model; Electricity price forecasting; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Independent system operators; Locational marginal prices; Price prediction; Power markets,4,1,1,1

It is the basis for decision-making in the electricity market. With the continuous development of global power marketization, the role of electricity price in the electricity market has received increasing attention. Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting can provide guidance for bidding strategies of market participants, thereby reducing bidding risks of participants and providing them with a stable return. However, due to the complex nature of electricity prices such as high volatility, high frequency, nonlinearity and non-stationarity, it is difficult to accurately predict electricity prices in advance. To improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a market clearing prices (MCPs) prediction method based on wavelet transforms (WT) and stacked autoencoders (SAEs). The deep learning framework comprises two stages is introduced in this work. First, WT is employed to decompose raw MCPs data into different frequency series for better behaviors. Second, the nonlinear features and invariant structures of each frequency are completely extracted by layer-wise pre-training based SAEs. The effectiveness of the proposed prediction method is verified by using actual price data from the Australian electricity market.

Power Grid Corporation (ISO), Indian Energy Exchange (ISO) & Kerala State Electricity Board (RTO) are the key players who perform this function for Kerala region. IEX manage the energy markets by operating three submarkets day-ahead, real-time& capacity markets. Through day-ahead market, electricity generators &load-serving entities submit their bids to receive & offer electricity to the power grid based on varying cost on each hour for the next operating day. In the real-time market, ISO & RTOs manage these changes in production & consumption throughout the day. They optimize the generation dispatch schedule where they consider generation cost & transmission constraints. Capacity markets are employed to have study flow of capital investments in the market thereby increasing the generation capacity. Currently, KSEB forecast & schedule power generation to ensure sufficient power is available at its disposal for transmission. But with generation capacity standing at a mere 30% of demand, it has to depend upon bulk purchases. To bring transparency to KSEB’s procurement programme, the Kerala state regulatory commission (erc Kerala) have provided adequate guidelines to consider commodity markets as well along with its traditional flat-ratecontracts.

These processes are commonly found in electricity markets and are gaining more importance as more market data become available and markets head toward continuous-time marginal pricing approaches. Forecasting these time series requires models that operate with continuous functions. This paper proposes a new functional forecasting method that attempts to generalize the standard seasonal ARMAX time series model to the L2 Hilbert space. The structure of the proposed model is a linear regression where functional parameters operate on functional variables. The variables can be lagged values of the series (autoregressive terms), past observed innovations (moving average terms), or exogenous variables. In this approach, the functional parameters used are integral operators whose kernels are modeled as linear combinations of sigmoid functions. The parameters of each sigmoid are optimized using a Quasi-Newton algorithm that minimizes the sum of squared errors. This novel approach allows us to estimate the moving average terms in functional time series models. The new model is tested by forecasting the daily price profile of the Spanish and German electricity markets and it is compared to other functional reference models. © 2017 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Functional ARMAX model; Functional data analysis; Functional time series,Commerce; Continuous time systems; Costs; Forecasting; Functions; Power markets; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Time series; ARMAX model; Electricity price forecasting; Functional data analysis; Functional forecasting; Functional parameters; Functional time series; Quasi-newton algorithm; Sum of squared errors; Time series analysis,4,1,1,1

Due to changes in electricity prices, the point forecasting accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Hence, participants are more interested in results of probabilistic forecasting methods such as prediction intervals method. In this paper, a hybrid approach for probabilistic electricity price forecasting is presented. This model is based on using improved clonal selection algorithm and extreme learning machine for neural networks training process and wavelet preprocess. The wavelet is utilized to decompose data into well behaved subsets, which increases accuracy of the model. Also, due to the high required computational time for training the neural networks, autocorrelation function is used to reduce the number of neural networks inputs. Finally, in order to evaluate the proposed probabilistic forecasting method, the Ontario and Australian electricity markets data are used. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Autocorrelation function; Improved clonal selection algorithm; Prediction intervals; Probabilistic forecasting; Wavelet preprocess,Algorithms; Autocorrelation; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Forecasting; Learning systems; Autocorrelation functions; Clonal selection algorithms; Prediction interval; Preprocess; Probabilistic forecasting; Power markets,5,1,1,2
"Ghofrani M., Azimi R., Najafabadi F.M., Myers N.",A new day-ahead hourly electricity price forecasting framework,2017,2,"This paper develops a hybrid electricity price-forecasting framework to improve the accuracy of prediction. A novel clustering method is proposed that uses a modified game theoretic self-organizing map (GTSOM) and neural gas (NG) along with competitive Hebbian Learning (CHL) to provide a better vector quantization (VQ). To resolve the deficiency of the original SOM, five strategies are proposed to enable the non-winning neurons to participate in the learning phase. Using GTSOM, the price-load input data are clustered into proper number of subsets. A novel cluster-selection method is proposed to select the most appropriate subset whose time-series data is processed to provide the inputs for the neural networks. Finally, Bayesian method is used to train the networks and forecast the electricity price. Market price data from an independent system operator is used to evaluate the algorithm performance. Furthermore, a comparison of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art forecasting techniques shows a significant improvement in the accuracy of the price forecast. © 2017 IEEE.",Bayesian learning; clustering; electricity price; forecasting; game theory; neural networks; persistence method; self-organizing map,Bayesian networks; Conformal mapping; Costs; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Game theory; Neural networks; Self organizing maps; Algorithm performance; Bayesian learning; clustering; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting techniques; Independent system operators; persistence method; Power markets,5,1,1,1
"Talari S., Shafie-khah M., Osório G.J., Wang F., Heidari A., Catalão J.P.S.",Price forecasting of electricity markets in the presence of a high penetration of wind power generators,2017,4,"Price forecasting plays a vital role in the day-ahead markets. Once sellers and buyers access an accurate price forecasting, managing the economic risk can be conducted appropriately through offering or bidding suitable prices. In networks with high wind power penetration, the electricity price is influenced by wind energy; therefore, price forecasting can be more complicated. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for price forecasting of day-ahead markets, with high penetration of wind generators based on Wavelet transform, bivariate Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN). To this end, a weighted time series for wind dominated power systems is calculated and added to a bivariate ARIMA model along with the price time series. Moreover, RBFN is applied as a tool to correct the estimation error, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the structure and adapt the RBFN to the particular training set. This method is evaluated on the Spanish electricity market, which shows the efficiency of this approach. This method has less error compared with other methods especially when it considers the effects of large-scale wind generators. © 2017 by the authors.",Bivariate ARIMA; Hybrid method; Price forecasting; Wavelet transform; Wind generator,accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; economic analysis; electricity industry; optimization; power generation; price dynamics; wavelet analysis; wind power,"4, 5",1,1,1

"Andrade J.R., Filipe J., Reis M., Bessa R.J.",Probabilistic price forecasting for day-ahead and intraday markets: Beyond the statistical model,2017,20,"Forecasting the hourly spot price of day-ahead and intraday markets is particularly challenging in electric power systems characterized by high installed capacity of renewable energy technologies. In particular, periods with low and high price levels are difficult to predict due to a limited number of representative cases in the historical dataset, which leads to forecast bias problems and wide forecast intervals. Moreover, these markets also require the inclusion of multiple explanatory variables, which increases the complexity of the model without guaranteeing a forecasting skill improvement. This paper explores information from daily futures contract trading and forecast of the daily average spot price to correct point and probabilistic forecasting bias. It also shows that an adequate choice of explanatory variables and use of simple models like linear quantile regression can lead to highly accurate spot price point and probabilistic forecasts. In terms of point forecast, the mean absolute error was 3.03 €/MWh for day-ahead market and a maximum value of 2.53 €/MWh was obtained for intraday session 6.

"Pircalabu A., Benth F.E.",A regime-switching copula approach to modeling day-ahead prices in coupled electricity markets,2017,10,"The recent price coupling of many European electricity markets has triggered a fundamental change in the interaction of day-ahead prices, challenging additionally the modeling of the joint behavior of prices in interconnected markets. In this paper we propose a regime-switching AR–GARCH copula to model pairs of day-ahead electricity prices in coupled European markets. While capturing key stylized facts empirically substantiated in the literature, this model easily allows us to 1) deviate from the assumption of normal margins and 2) include a more detailed description of the dependence between prices. We base our empirical study on four pairs of prices, namely Germany–France, Germany–Netherlands, Netherlands–Belgium and Germany–Western Denmark. We find that the marginal dynamics are better described by the flexible skew t distribution than the benchmark normal distribution. Also, we find significant evidence of tail dependence in all pairs of interconnected areas we consider. As a first application of the proposed model, we consider the pricing of financial transmission rights, and highlight how the choice of marginal distributions and copula impacts prices. As a second application we consider the forecasting of tail quantiles, and evaluate the out-of-sample performance of competing models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Copula models; Day-ahead electricity prices; Financial transmission rights; Market coupling; Tail dependence; Tail quantile forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Normal distribution; Copula models; Electricity prices; Financial transmission right; Market coupling; Tail dependence; Power markets; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; modeling; performance assessment; price dynamics; Belgium; Denmark; France; Germany; Netherlands,"3, 4",1,1,1
"Guo W., Zhao Z.",A novel hybrid BND-FOA-LSSVM model for electricity price forecasting,2017,6,"Accurate electricity price forecasting plays an important role in the profits of electricity market participants and the healthy development of electricity market. However, the electricity price time series hold the characteristics of volatility and randomness, which make it quite hard to forecast electricity price accurately. In this paper, a novel hybrid model for electricity price forecasting was proposed combining Beveridge-Nelson decomposition (BND) method, fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) model, namely BND-FOA-LSSVM model. Firstly, the original electricity price time series were decomposed into deterministic term, periodic term, and stochastic term by using BND model. Then, these three decomposed terms were forecasted by employing LSSVM model, respectively. Meanwhile, to improve the forecasting performance, a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm FOA was used to automatically determine the optimal parameters of LSSVM model for deterministic term forecasting, periodic term forecasting, and stochastic term forecasting. Finally, the forecasting result of electricity price can be obtained by multiplying the forecasting values of these three terms. The results show the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the proposed BND-FOA-LSSVM model are respectively 3.48%, 11.18 Yuan/MWh and 9.95 Yuan/MWh, which are much smaller than that of LSSVM, BND-LSSVM, FOA-LSSVM, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-FOA-LSSVM models. The proposed BND-FOA-LSSVM model is effective and practical for electricity price forecasting, which can improve the electricity price forecasting accuracy. © 2017 by the authors.",Beveridge-Nelson decomposition method (BND); Electricity price forecasting; Fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA); Intelligence forecasting; Least square support vectormachine (LSSVM),Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Errors; Forecasting; Fruits; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Optimization; Signal processing; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Time series; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Decomposition methods; Electricity price forecasting; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA); Least square support vector machines; Mean absolute percentage error; Swarm intelligence optimization algorithm; Power markets,5,1,1,1

Particle swarm optimization is used to optimize each GRNN initial weight within the ensemble system. Experimental results showed that the VMD-based ensemble outperformed EMD-based ensemble forecasting system in terms of mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean-squared error. It also outperformed the conventional auto-regressive moving average model used for comparison purpose. As a result, the VMD-based GRNN ensemble forecasting paradigm could be a promising methodology for California electricity and Brent crude oil price prediction. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); energy price; ensemble system; forecasting; generalized regression neural network; variational mode decomposition (VMD),Costs; Crude oil; Errors; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Regression analysis; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Energy prices; Ensemble systems; Generalized regression neural networks; Mode decomposition; Signal processing,5,1,1,1
"Saâdaoui F., Mrad M.",Stochastic modelling of the price-volume relationship in electricity markets: Evidence from the Nordic energy exchange,2017,1,"The analysis of the interactions between price and transaction volume, conducted as part of a financial market, is one of the central themes of the financial theory. However, with the emergence of power exchanges and despite the expansion of the research sphere in this context, this issue had not been sufficiently addressed. This is due to not only the lack of concepts in theory but also to the peculiarity of price dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the nature of the relationship between price changes and trading volume in the Nordic power market (Nord Pool), which is one of the largest energy markets worldwide. Through statistical timing analysis of the price-volume covariation, we reconsider this joint modelling, but only settling for daily observations, which makes the specificity of this work. Contrary to most comparable works, which were based on high frequency data, we chose to omit intraday observations to circumvent the repercussion of the daily seasonality on one side and ensure more lucidity and clairvoyance to a wider horizon on the other. The empirical results go in line with our expectations and provide support for the claim that there exists a significant reciprocal causality between prices and trading volume.

In recent years, electric power system deregulation has been spread in the world so that electricity power markets become more complicated.

In this paper, a hybrid intelligent method is proposed to provide one-step ahead predicted values of electricity price with a couple of strategies; Fuzzy c-Varieties and improved GRBFN. The former is used to classify input data into some fuzzy clusters while the latter is employed to provide the predicted electricity price at each cluster by applying Deterministic Annealing clustering to the determination of the initial values of parameters in the Gaussian functions. The reason why Fuzzy c-Varieties are used is to increases the number of data by allowing each data to be belonged to more than two clusters.

Conversely, consumers can use price forecasting to exploit appropriate power purchasing strategies for maximum utility utilization. Here the most influential historical data, namely purchase bid and MCP, are considered for training the feed-forward back-propagation neural network. The proposed model involves three sequential phases. Initially, the raw historical data are smoothened by removing the high-frequency components using a wavelet transform method which may enable better training of neural network. Then, ANN is used to train historical patterns. More number of trials is carried out, and the final weights that give the least training error are stored. In the final phase, the stored weights that are obtained from various trials are used as the initial population for the embedded ANN-PSO model.

In the first step, a new hybrid method is proposed to estimate point forecasts: combination of wavelet transformation (Wt), feature selection based on Mutual Information (MI), extreme learning machine (ELM), and bootstrap approaches in an ensemble structure is employed. The second step consists of the following stepwise parts: calculating the variance of the model uncertainties based on the extracted data from the ensemble structure, estimating the noise variance by using the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), and improving the accuracy of interval forecasting by using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm.

Day-ahead prediction provides forecast prices for a day ahead that is useful for daily operation and decision-making. The main challenge for day ahead price forecasting is the accuracy and efficiency. Lower accuracy is produced due to the nature of electricity price that is highly volatile compared to load series. Hence, some researchers have developed complex procedures to produce accurate forecast while considering significant features and optimum parameters. Therefore, a multistage optimization for hybrid Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model is developed in this study to provide an accurate price forecast with optimized parameters and input features. So far, no literature has been found on multistage feature and parameter selections using the methods of LSSVM-GA for day-ahead price prediction.

"Gupta S., Chitkara P.",Day ahead price forecasting models in thin electricity market,2017,2,"Day Ahead Electricity Markets (DAMs) in India are thin but growing. Consistent price forecasts are important for their utilization in portfolio optimization models. Univariate or multivariate models with standard exogenous variables such as special day effects etc. are not always useful. Drivers of demand and supply include weather variations over large geographic areas, outages of power system elements and sudden changes in contracts which lead the players to access power exchanges. These needs to be considered in forecasting models. Such models are observed to considerably reduce forecasting errors by outperforming other models under conditions, which are neither infrequent nor recur at defined intervals. This paper develops models for India and tests the utility of these models using Model Confidence Set (MCS) approach which picks up the 'best' models. The approach has been developed for a power utility in India over a period of two years in live business environment. © 2017 IEEE.",Day ahead price forecasting; Electricity market; IEX; MCS; thin electricity market,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Optimization; Business environments; Day-ahead electricity market; Day-ahead prices; Exogenous variables; Forecasting error; Forecasting models; Multivariate models; Portfolio optimization models; Power markets,4,1,1,1
"Shao Z., Yang S., Gao F., Zhou K., Lin P.",A new electricity price prediction strategy using mutual information-based SVM-RFE classification,2017,21,"Owing to the central role in electricity market operation, researchers have long sought to investigate the price responsiveness of both electricity supply and consumption sides. From the perspective of demand-side management (DSM), electricity prices prediction can be regarded as a pattern recognition problem of classifying future electricity prices with respect to a predefined threshold. From a fresh perspective this paper develops an efficient framework, called TSS-RFE-MRMR based SVM (Time series segmentation, recursive feature elimination, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance based support vector machine), for providing estimates of price fluctuation over certain valuation domains and modeling high-dimensional electricity market price without adopting additional impact factors. It starts from adopting a novel feature space determination scheme, called principal component analysis-dynamic programming (PCA-DP) based time series segmentation. Then, the RFE-MRMR filter for significant features selection is implemented, where both redundant and less relevant features are progressively eliminated among the potential feature sets. To test the performance of the proposed approach, it is evaluated on Ontario and New York electricity markets and compared with other method. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other traditional method and present a relatively higher prediction accuracy on the electricity price. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity market price prediction; Minimum redundancy maximum relevancy; Pattern classification; SVM-RFE; Time series segmentation,Classification (of information); Commerce; Dynamic programming; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Pattern recognition; Power markets; Principal component analysis; Redundancy; Support vector machines; Time series; Time series analysis; Electricity market operations; Market price; Minimum redundancy maximum relevancy; Minimum redundancy-maximum relevances; Pattern recognition problems; Recursive feature elimination; SVM-RFE; Time-series segmentation; Costs,5,1,1,2
Saâdaoui F.,A seasonal feedforward neural network to forecast electricity prices,2017,15,"In power industry and management, given the peculiarity and high complexity of the time series, it is highly requested to make models more flexible and well adapted to the data, in order to give them the ability to capture and recognize the most complex patterns, and consequently gain more accuracy in forecasting. To fulfill this aim, we define the seasonal autoregressive neural network (SAR-NN) as a dynamic feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), essentially conceived to forecast electricity prices. The SAR-NN is an ANN-based autoregressive model that considers that autoregressors are only those that are lagged by a multiple of the period p of the dominating seasonality. Moving forward this neural network, step-by-step, allows to generate multiple-steps-ahead reliable forecasts. This model is specifically designed to robustly overcome the strong seasonal effects and the other nonlinear patterns that often harm ANNs forecasting performance. The strategy is tested and compared to a number of homologous models throughout empirical experiments. As a case study, we focus on the Nord Pool Scandinavian power market, which is one of the most mature energy markets worldwide. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Artificial neural networks; Electricity spot prices; Forecasting; Nord Pool market; Seasonal autoregressive models,Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Auto regressive models; Autoregressive neural networks; Dynamic feedforward; Electricity spot price; Empirical experiments; Forecasting performance; Pool markets; Seasonal autoregressive models; Electric network parameters,"4, 5",1,1,1
Bennedsen M.,A rough multi-factor model of electricity spot prices,2017,7,"We introduce a new continuous-time mathematical model of electricity spot prices which accounts for the most important stylized facts of these time series: seasonality, spikes, stochastic volatility, and mean reversion. Empirical studies have found a possible fifth stylized fact, roughness, and our approach explicitly incorporates this into the model of the prices. Our setup generalizes the popular Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-based multi-factor framework of Benth et al. (2007) and allows us to perform statistical tests to distinguish between an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-based model and a rough model. Further, through the multi-factor approach we account for seasonality and spikes before estimating – and making inference on – the degree of roughness. This is novel in the literature and we present simulation evidence showing that these precautions are crucial for accurate estimation. Lastly, we estimate our model on recent data from six European energy exchanges and find statistical evidence of roughness in five out of six markets. As an application of our model, we show how, in these five markets, a rough component improves short term forecasting of the prices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity prices; Energy markets; Forecasting; Fractals; Mean reversion; Multi-factor modeling; Roughness,Commerce; Continuous time systems; Costs; Estimation; Forecasting; Fractals; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Surface roughness; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Energy markets; European energy exchanges; Mean reversion; Multi factors; Short-term forecasting; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic models; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; fractal analysis; numerical model; price determination; Europe,4,1,1,1
"Varshney H., Sharma A., Kumar R.",A hybrid approach to price forecasting incorporating exogenous variables for a day ahead electricity Market,2017,7,"Predicting Location Based Market Price (LBMP) in real time is an important and complex task that involves a great accuracy to model extreme spikes. Occurrence of spikes in real time LBMP is due to uncertainty in load demand as well as a significant variation in surrounding temperature throughout the day. These fluctuations cause extreme spikes in market clearing price due to transmission outages, shortage of supply and consumption of costly generation reserves. Therefore, the market participants are forced to purchase the electricity at very high price but the regulation set on the price cap by market authorities results into an economic loss to retailers and market participants. Accordingly, accurate forecasting of price is an important exercise to hedge against volatility. This paper proposes a hybrid technique comprising singular spectrum analysis and neural network incorporating temperature and load data for forecasting in day ahead electricity market. The results obtained with this hybrid technique are found to be more accurate when compared to existing methods described in literature. © 2016 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; neural network; real time forecast; singular spectrum analysis,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Intelligent control; Losses; Neural networks; Plasma diagnostics; Power control; Power electronics; Spectrum analysis; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Exogenous variables; Market Clearing Price; Market participants; Real-time forecasts; Singular spectrum analysis; Surrounding temperature; Power markets,5,2,1,1

Due to the sensitivity of forecasting issues in market's performance, and high prediction error resulted from the behavior of price series, nowadays probabilistic forecasting highly attracted participants' attention. In this paper, a probabilistic approach for the hourly electricity price forecasting is presented. In the proposed method, the uncertainty of predictor model is considered as the uncertainty factor. The bootstrapping technique is used to implement the uncertainty and since the method is needed to be fast and of low computational cost in the daily forecasting, a generalized learning method is applied, which has high accuracy and speed. This newly presented learning method is based on generalized extreme learning machine approach to be used for improved wavelet neural networks. Also in order to reach more accommodation, the predictor model with the changes of price time series, the wavelet preprocessing is used.

"Özgüner E., Tör O.B., Güven A.N.",Probabilistic day-ahead system marginal price forecasting with ANN for the Turkish electricity market,2017,2,This study presents a system day-ahead hourly market clearing price forecasting tool for the day-ahead (DA) market and a system DA hourly marginal price forecasting tool for the real-time market of the Turkish electric market (TEM). These forecasting tools are developed based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). A series of historical price data of the TEM are utilized to model and optimize the ANN structure and to develop the ANN-based price forecasting tool. The methodology used to select the optimum ANN architecture provides the minimum daily mean absolute percentage error for both day-ahead market prices in the TEM. Performances of the proposed ANN model and the multiple linear regression model in forecasting the day-ahead hourly market clearing price are compared.

The traditional prediction model has a large error and low generalization ability to forecast the short-term marginal price.

"Itaba S., Mori H.",A Fuzzy-Preconditioned GRBFN Model for Electricity Price Forecasting,2017,5,"This paper proposes a fuzzy-preconditioned ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model for electricity price forecasting. The deregulated electric power systems have been widely spread to trade electric power through electric power markets. The market players are interested in gaining the inside track to maximize the profits and minimize risks in advance. One of the most important tasks is how to forecast a complicated time series of electricity price that affects transmission network congestion. In practice, it is hard to forecast electricity price with the spikes due to the high nonlinearity. In this paper, GRBFN (General Radial Basis Function Network) of ANN is proposed for electricity price forecasting. It is an extension of RBFN of ANN in a way that the optimal parameters of the Gaussian functions are determined by the learning process in RBFN. To improve the model accuracy of GRBFN, FCE (fuzzy c-Elliptotypes) is introduced into GRBFN as a fuzzy precondition technique. FCE is an extension of FCM (fuzzy c-means) and plays a key role to classify input data into fuzzy clusters. The use of FCE contributes to the improvement of model accuracy for spikes of electricity price that bring about much higher price. This paper makes use of DA clustering to evaluate a better initial solution of the parameters of the Gaussian functions. Also, EPSO of evolutionary computation is used to evaluate better weights between neurons. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of electricity price. © 2017 The Author(s).",artificial neural network; DA clustering; electricity price; EPSO; evolutionary computation; fuzzy c-Elliptotypes; fuzzy clustering; global clustering; GRBFN; power markets; RBFN; spikes; time-series forecasting,Adaptive systems; Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Deregulation; Electric power systems; Embedded systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Function evaluation; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy inference; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Time series; DA clustering; Electricity prices; EPSO; fuzzy c-Elliptotypes; Global clustering; GRBFN; RBFN; spikes; Time series forecasting; Power markets,5,1,1,1
"Smolen J., Dudic B.",The role of residual demand in electricity price analysis and forecasting: Case of Czech electricity market,2017,6,"Most of scientific papers dealing with power price predictions base their work on various statistical time series models. In this paper we propose a new, purely fundamental, approach to the issues of electricity price analysis and forecasting. While precise replication of real power market processes is very complicated, we show that even relatively simple fundamental model is able to explain large part of price movements on the electricity markets. Analysis presented is based predominantly on the merit order theory and introduces the concept of residual demand as a crucial variable for explaining hourly electricity price movements. While the analysis shown in this paper is applied to the Czech Electricity day-ahead market, it can be well replicated also for the other relevant European power market areas. Tests of fundamental approaches towards power price forecasting have shown very promising results and we believe they deserve more attention from the electricity market researchers. © 2017, Econjournals.

In short term forecast, electricity price can be predicted for an hour-ahead or day-ahead. An hour-ahead prediction offers the market members with the pre-dispatch prices for the next hour. It is useful for an effective bidding strategy where the quantity of bids can be revised or changed prior to the dispatch hour. However, only a few studies have been conducted in the field of hour-ahead forecasting. This is due to most of the power markets apply two-settlement market structure (day-ahead and real time) or standard market design rather than single-settlement system (real time). Therefore, a multistage optimization for hybrid Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model is developed in this study to provide an accurate price forecast with optimized parameters and input features. So far, no literature has been found on multistage feature and parameter selections using the methods of LSSVM-GA for hour-ahead price prediction. All the models are examined on the Ontario power market; which is reported as among the most volatile market worldwide.

"Wolff G., Feuerriegel S.",Short-term dynamics of day-ahead and intraday electricity prices,2017,6,"Purpose: Since the liberalization of electricity markets in the European Union, prices are subject to market dynamics. Hence, understanding the short-term drivers of electricity prices is of major interest to electricity companies and policymakers. Accordingly, this paper aims to study movements of prices in the combined German and Austrian electricity market. Design/methodology/approach: This paper estimates an autoregressive model with exogenous variables (ARX) in a two-step procedure. In the first step, both time series, which inherently feature seasonality, are de-seasonalized, and in the second step, the influence of all model variables on the two dependent variables, i.e. the day-ahead and intraday European Power Energy Exchange prices, is measured. Findings: The results reveal that the short-term market is largely driven by seasonality, consumer demand and short-term feed-ins from renewable energy sources. As a contribution to the existing body of literature, this paper specifically compares the price movements in day-ahead and intraday markets. In intraday markets, the influences of renewable energies are much stronger than in day-ahead markets, i.e. by 24.12 per cent for wind and 116.82 per cent for solar infeeds. Originality/value: Knowledge on the price setting mechanism in the intraday market is particularly scarce. This paper contributes to existing research on this topic by deriving drivers in the intraday market and then contrasting them to the day-ahead market. A more thorough understanding is especially crucial for all stakeholders, who can use this knowledge to optimize their bidding strategies. Furthermore, the findings suggest policy implications for a more stable and efficient electricity market. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Autoregressive; Electricity; External drivers; Modelling; Pricing; Renewable energies; Time series analysis; Weather influence,Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric industry; Electricity; Models; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive model with exogenous variable (ARX); Dependent variables; Design/methodology/approach; Electricity companies; Policy implications; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Power markets,4,1,"1, 2",1
"Abate G.D., Haldrup N.",Space-time modeling of electricity spot prices,2017,1,"Using data for the Nord Pool power grid, we derive a space-time Durbin model for electricity spot prices with both temporal and spatial lags. Joint modeling of temporal and spatial adjustment effects is necessarily important when prices and loads are determined in a network grid. By using different spatial weight matrices, statistical tests show significant spatial dependence in the spot price dynamics across areas. In fact, estimation of the model shows that the spatial dependence is as important as the temporal dependence in describing the spot price dynamics. We decompose price impacts into direct and indirect effects and demonstrate how price effects transmit to neighboring markets and decline with distance. A forecasting comparison with a non-spatial model shows that the space-time model improves forecasting performance for 7 and 30 days ahead forecasts. A model with time-varying parameters is estimated for an expanded sample period and it is found that the spatial correlation within the power grid has increased over time. We interpret this to indicate an increasing degree of market integration within the sample period. © 2017 by the IAEE.

"Domanski P.D., Gintrowski M.",Alternative approaches to the prediction of electricity prices,2017,8,"Purpose: This paper aims to present the results of the comparison between different approaches to the prediction of electricity prices. It is well-known that the properties of the data generation process may prefer some modeling methods over the others. The data having an origin in social or market processes are characterized by unexpectedly wide realization space resulting in the existence of the long tails in the probabilistic density function. These data may not be easy in time series prediction using standard approaches based on the normal distribution assumptions. The electricity prices on the deregulated market fall into this category. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents alternative approaches, i.e. memory-based prediction and fractal approach compared with established nonlinear method of neural networks. The appropriate interpretation of results is supported with the statistical data analysis and data conditioning. These algorithms have been applied to the problem of the energy price prediction on the deregulated electricity market with data from Polish and Austrian energy stock exchanges. Findings: The first outcome of the analysis is that there are several situations in the task of time series prediction, when standard modeling approach based on the assumption that each change is independent of the last following random Gaussian bell pattern may not be a true. In this paper, such a case was considered: price data from energy markets. Electricity prices data are biased by the human nature. It is shown that more relevant for data properties was Cauchy probabilistic distribution. Results have shown that alternative approaches may be used and prediction for both data memory-based approach resulted in the best performance. Research limitations/implications: “Personalization” of the model is crucial aspect in the whole methodology. All available knowledge should be used on the forecasted phenomenon and incorporate it into the model. In case of the memory-based modeling, it is a specific design of the history searching routine that uses the understanding of the process features. Importance should shift toward methodology structure design and algorithm customization and then to parameter estimation. Such modeling approach may be more descriptive for the user enabling understanding of the process and further iterative improvement in a continuous striving for perfection. Practical implications: Memory-based modeling can be practically applied. These models have large potential that is worth to be exploited. One disadvantage of this modeling approach is large calculation effort connected with a need of constant evaluation of large data sets. It was shown that a graphics processing unit (GPU) approach through parallel calculation on the graphical cards can improve it dramatically. Social implications: The modeling of the electricity prices has big impact of the daily operation of the electricity traders and distributors. From one side, appropriate modeling can improve performance mitigating risks associated with the process. Thus, the end users should receive higher quality of services ultimately with lower prices and minimized risk of the energy loss incidents. Originality/value: The use of the alternative approaches, such as memory-based reasoning or fractals, is very rare in the field of the electricity price forecasting. Thus, it gives a new impact for further research enabling development of better solutions incorporating all available process knowledge and customized hybrid algorithms. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Artificial intelligence; Econometric; Energy sector; Forecasting; Modelling; Neural networks; Pricing; Time series analysis,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Deregulation; Electronic trading; Energy dissipation; Forecasting; Fractals; Graphics processing unit; Iterative methods; Models; Neural networks; Normal distribution; Power markets; Probability distributions; Program processors; Time series analysis; Deregulated electricity market; Design/methodology/approach; Econometric; Electricity price forecasting; Energy sector; Probabilistic density function; Probabilistic distribution; Statistical data analysis; Costs,5,1,1,1

With the upsurge in restructuring of the power markets, electricity price plays a dominant role in the current deregulated market scenario which is majorly influenced by the economics being governed. In the deregulated environment price forecasting is an important aspect for the power system planning. The problem of price forecasting can be entirely viewed as a signal processing problem with proper estimation of model parameters, modeling of uncertainties, etc. Among the different existing models the artificial neural network based models have gained wide popularity due their black box structure but it too has its own limitations. In the proposed work in order to overcome the limitations of the classical artificial neural network model, generalized neuron model is used for forecasting the short term electricity price of Australian electricity market.

"Wang D., Luo H., Grunder O., Lin Y., Guo H.",Multi-step ahead electricity price forecasting using a hybrid model based on two-layer decomposition technique and BP neural network optimized by firefly algorithm,2017,125,"In the deregulated competitive electricity market, the price which reflects the relationship between electricity supply and demand is one of the most important elements, making it crucial for all market participants to precisely forecast the electricity price. However, electricity price series usually has complex features such as non-linearity, non-stationarity and volatility, which makes the price forecasting turn out to be very difficult. In order to improve the accuracy of electricity price forecasting, this paper first proposes a two-layer decomposition technique and then develops a hybrid model based on fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition (FEEMD), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and back propagation (BP) neural network optimized by firefly algorithm (FA). The proposed model is unique in the sense that VMD is specifically applied to further decompose the high frequency intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) generated by FEEMD into a number of modes in order to improve the forecast accuracy. To validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model, three electricity price series respectively collected from the real-world electricity markets of Australia and France are adopted to conduct the empirical study. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the other considered models over horizons of one-step, two-step, four-step and six-step ahead forecasting, which shows that the proposed model has superior performances for both one-step and multi-step ahead forecasting of electricity price. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Back propagation neural network; Electricity price forecasting; Fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Firefly algorithm; Multi-step ahead; Variational mode decomposition,Backpropagation algorithms; Bioluminescence; Commerce; Competition; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Optimization; Signal processing; Back propagation neural networks; Electricity price forecasting; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Firefly algorithms; Mode decomposition; Multi-step; Power markets; artificial neural network; back propagation; decomposition; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy market; numerical model; optimization; price dynamics; Australia; France,5,1,1,1
"Bello A., Bunn D.W., Reneses J., Munoz A.",Medium-Term Probabilistic Forecasting of Electricity Prices: A Hybrid Approach,2017,22,"This paper provides a focus upon forecasting electricity prices in the medium term (from a few weeks to several months ahead) in which accurate estimates of tail risks, e.g., at the 1%, 5%, 95%, and 99%, are important. Medium term forecasting and risk analysis are important for operational scheduling, fuel purchasing, trading, and profit management. We extend the research on hybrid forecasting methods, which link detailed fundamental price formation models, using optimization techniques and market equilibrium considerations, with econometric recalibration to the time series data. This paper is innovative in its use of quantile regression to undertake the recalibration and provide accurate risk estimates. It is shown that probabilistic outputs from the fundamental model add value over expected value inputs to the quantile regressions and that if the fundamental model is itself well specified to diurnal variation through the inclusion of relevant explanatory variables such as demand or climatic conditions, then it is not necessary to undertake the quantile regressions separately for each hour of the day. A real application of the proposed methodology is successfully tested on the Spanish electric power system, in which the high penetration of intermittent wind generation creates extreme price risks. The hybrid method outperforms the more conventional fundamental model, making particular use of wind generation data in the quantile recalibrations. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Electricity prices; fundamentals; hybrid model; probabilistic forecasting; quantile regression,Commerce; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Scheduling; Electricity prices; fundamentals; Hybrid model; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile regression; Costs,4,2,1,2
"Yang Z., Ce L., Lian L.","Electricity price forecasting by a hybrid model, combining wavelet transform, ARMA and kernel-based extreme learning machine methods",2017,138,"Electricity prices have rather complex features such as high volatility, high frequency, nonlinearity, mean reversion and non-stationarity that make forecasting very difficult. However, accurate electricity price forecasting is essential to market traders, retailers, and generation companies. To improve prediction accuracy using each model's unique features, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines the wavelet transform, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) based on self-adapting particle swarm optimization and an auto regressive moving average (ARMA). Self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) is adopted to search for the optimal kernel parameters of the KELM. After testing the wavelet decomposition components, stationary series as new input sets are predicted by the ARMA model and non-stationary series are predicted by the SAPSO-KELM model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using electricity price data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), Australian and Spanish markets. The experimental results show that the developed method has more accurate prediction, better generality and practicability than individual methods and other hybrid methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",ARMA; Electricity price forecasting; KELM; SAPSO; Wavelet transform,Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Time series analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; ARMA; Autoregressive moving average; Decomposition components; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme learning machine; KELM; Non-stationary series; SAPSO; Power markets; accuracy assessment; electricity generation; energy market; machine learning; nonlinearity; numerical model; optimization; price dynamics; Australia; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; United States,"4, 5",2,1,1

Selecting the best training variables is often involved in forecasting in order to obtain optimal prediction. Support Vector Regression (SVR) provides an effective method to fit data and find minimal risk slack variables around a fit line.

Thus, how to select an optimization model to improve the forecasting accuracy of electricity price is not only an extremely challenging problem but also a concerned problem for different participants in an electricity market due to our society becoming heavily reliant on electricity. Many researchers developed hybrid models through the use of optimization methods, classical statistical models, artificial intelligence approaches and de-noising methods. However, few researchers aim to select reasonable samples and determine appropriate features when forecasting electricity price. Based on the Index of Bad Samples Matrix (IBSM), a novel method to dynamically confirm bad training samples, and the Optimization Algorithm (OA), DCANN and Updated DCANN are proposed in this paper for forecasting the day-ahead electricity price. This model is a hybrid system of supervised and unsupervised learning and creatively applies the idea of deleting bad samples and searching quality inputs to develop and learn, which is unlike BPANN, RBFN, SVM and LSSVM.

"Dash S.K., Bisoi R., Dash P.K.",A hybrid functional link dynamic neural network and evolutionary unscented Kalman filter for short-term electricity price forecasting,2016,7,"Electricity price is an important aspect in a restructured power market. Because of nonlinearity, nonstationary, and volatility of electricity price, it is highly essential to forecast the price on a short-term scale. This paper presents an efficient method based on a hybrid functional link dynamic neural network (DNN) trained by an adaptive robust unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The proposed method forecasts hourly prices for the day-ahead electricity market. The functional block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher-dimensional space through a basis function without using any hidden layer like multilayer perceptron structure. The DNN includes one or more infinite impulse response filters in the forward path providing feedback connections between outputs and inputs. This allows signal flow in both forward and backward directions, giving the network a dynamic memory useful to mimic dynamic systems. Also to improve the accuracy of the forecast, the noise covariance matrices of the UKF are adapted recursively. The proposed method is tested on PJM electricity market, and the residuals mean absolute error is compared with other forecasting methods, indicating the improved accuracy of the approach and its suitability to produce a real-time forecast.

Instead of directly modeling the electricity price as it is usually done in time series or data mining approaches, we model and utilize its true source: the sale and purchase curves of the electricity exchange. We will refer to this new model as X-Model, as almost every deregulated electricity price is simply the result of the intersection of the electricity supply and demand curve at a certain auction. Therefore we show an approach to deal with a tremendous amount of auction data, using a subtle data processing technique as well as dimension reduction and lasso based estimation methods.

Responsiveness of the market participants can improve reliability of system operation as well as capital cost investments. In this regard, the accurate forecast of electricity price and demand in smart grids is an important challenge as their strong correlation makes a separate forecasting to be ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneous forecast of price and demand that uses a set of effective tools in preprocessing part, forecast engine and tuned algorithm. To highlight our contributions, the proposed forecast algorithm classified into three main parts. The first part employs a new Flexible Wavelet Packet Transform (FWPT) to decompose a signal into multiple terms at different frequencies, and a new feature selection method that employs Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) and adjacent features in order to select valuable input data. The second part consists of a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model based on Nonlinear Least Square Support Vector Machine (NLSSVM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in order to model the linear and nonlinear correlation between price and load in two stages. The final part employs a modified version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm based on time-varying coefficients and stumble generation operator, called TV-SABC, in order to optimize NLSSVM parameters in a learning process. The proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm is evaluated on several real and well-known markets illustrating its high accuracy in simultaneous forecast of electricity price and demand.

This paper provides two methods to predict next-day electricity demand and price daily curves given information from past curves.

"Li P., Arci F., Reilly J., Curran K., Belatreche A.",Using artificial neural networks to predict short-term wholesale prices on the Irish Single Electricity Market,2016,2,"Electricity markets are different from other markets as electricity generation cannot be easily stored in large amounts and in order to avoid blackouts, the generation of electricity must be balanced with customer demand for it on a second-by-second basis. Customers tend to rely on electricity for day-to-day living and cannot replace it easily so when electricity prices increase, customer demand generally does not reduce significantly in the short-term. As electricity generation and customer demand must be matched perfectly second-by-second, and because generation cannot be stored to a large extent, cost bids from generators must be balanced with demand estimates in advance of real-time. This paper outlines a a forecasting algorithm built on artificial neural networks in order to predict short-term (72 hours ahead) wholesale prices on the Irish Single Electricity Market so that market participants can make more informed trading decisions. Research studies have demonstrated that an adaptive or self-adaptive approach to forecasting would appear more suited to the task of predicting energy demands in territory such as Ireland.

The models are built using regression techniques and aim to obtain, for each hour, the quantiles of 5% to 95% by steps of 5%. © 2016 IEEE.",Day-ahead forecast; Iberian electricity market; machine learning; probabilistic forecasting; quantile regression,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Electric industry; Forecasting; Learning systems; Uncertainty analysis; Day-ahead; Decision making process; Iberian electricity market; Market participants; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic forecasts; Quantile regression; Regression techniques; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,2
"He D., Chen W.-P.",A real-time electricity price forecasting based on the spike clustering analysis,2016,3,"This paper mainly focuses on the 5-minute resolution real-time price forecasting in New York electricity market. An accurate forecasting is regarded as a key to win the bidding in today's highly competitive electricity market. We propose a combination of support-vector machine (SVM) with self-organized map (SOM) to forecast the instance and magnitude of price spikes. The SVM is used for detecting the existence of the spike and the SOM is used to clustering the spike. To provide a price probability distribution for the spike values, the bagging mechanism is introduced to the SOM algorithm. A summer case study is presented to evaluate the proposed model. The result shows greatly potential of the proposed solution in the real applications. © 2016 IEEE.",electricity market; electricity price; NYISO; SOM; SVM,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Support vector machines; Clustering analysis; Competitive electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; NYISO; Real applications; Real-time price; Self-organized map; Power markets,5,1,2,2

In all market places (day-ahead, intra-day and real-time) accurate price prediction is needed to generate optimal bids and maximize the profit. This paper first presents three methods for forecasting day-ahead market prices, namely Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heterosedastic (GARCH), Holt-Winter (HW) and Mean Reversion and Jump Diffusion (MRJD). These methods are based on three broad methodologies of time series analysis, exponential-smoothing and stochastic processes. The dynamics of hourly prices in day-ahead market are varying from day to day. Each forecasting tool is suitable to capture one type of price dynamics. To capture this phenomenon, we combine GARCH, HW and MRJD methods using proposed Markov switch.

However, the deregulation of electricity markets created a competitive environment and the introduction of new market participants, such as the retailers and aggregators, whose economic viability and profitability highly depends on the spot market price patterns. The aim of this study is to examine artificial neural network (ANN) based models for Day-ahead price forecasting. Specifically, the models refer to the sole application of ANNs or to hybrid models, where the ANN is combined with clustering algorithm. The training data are clustered in homogenous groups and for each cluster, a dedicated forecaster is employed. The proposed models are characterized by comprehensive operation and by high level of flexibility; different inputs can be taken under consideration and different ANN topologies can be examined. The models are tested on a data set that consists of atypical price patterns and many outliers. This approach makes the price forecasting problem a more challenging task, providing evidence that the proposed models can be considered as useful and robust forecasting tools to the actual needs of market participants, including the traditional generation companies and self-producers, but also the retailers/suppliers and aggregators. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial neural networks; Day-ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Time-series clustering,Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Competitive environment; Day ahead market; Economic viability; Electricity price forecasting; Generation companies; Market participants; Price forecasting; Time series clustering; Power markets,5,1,1,1
"Rafiei M., Niknam T., Khooban M.H.",A novel intelligent strategy for probabilistic electricity price forecasting: Wavelet neural network based modified dolphin optimization algorithm,2016,12,"To simplify decision making of market participants, a careful and reliable electricity market price forecasting method is indispensable. Nevertheless, due to the Instability in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather tough to forecast MCPs accurately. Using probabilistic forecasting is a new solution to overcome the low accuracy of forecast. Transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts is too important to model the uncertainties of forecasts. Thus the decision making activities of market participants are supported against uncertainties and risks effectively. In this paper a hybrid approach to achieve prediction intervals (PIs) of MCPs is proposed that modified dolphin echolocation optimization algorithm (MDEOA) is applied to estimate point forecasts, model uncertainties, and noise variance. This proposed electricity price probabilistic forecasting method is evaluated by a generalized and comprehensive framework. To test the proposed hybrid method, real price data from Ontario, New England, and, Australian electricity markets are used and effectiveness of the method is validated. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.",modified dolphin echolocation optimization algorithm; prediction intervals; Probabilistic forecasting; wavelet neural network; wavelet preprocessing,Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Dolphins (structures); Optimization; Power markets; Sonar; Uncertainty analysis; Optimization algorithms; Prediction interval; Probabilistic forecasting; Wavelet neural networks; Wavelet pre-processing; Forecasting,5,1,1,2

In such conditions, electricity price is a key index that reflects competition between generators, percentage of renewable generation and load behavior. An accurate forecast of the future price allows both producers and customers to plan their strategies, increase their profits and avoid contingencies. For this purpose, this paper proposes two predictors that perform half-hour-ahead and dayahead price forecast, respectively. Both predictors are based on three learning machines, namely artificial neural network, support vector regression and random forest, in addition to persistence model which is used as reference. The built models are tested through real historical time series from New South Wales in Australia, which include half-hourly price and load. The profiles are analyzed with the aim of defining correlations and choosing adequate inputs. Then, the performance of each machine is assessed using the mean absolute percentage error, in order to determine the most suitable prediction machine according to the case. Furthermore, the best forecast situations are plotted to evaluate the ability of predicting sudden and sharp price peaks. © 2016 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Day-ahead market; Deregulation; Short term price forecasting,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Deregulation; Electric power measurement; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Comparative studies; Day ahead market; Day-ahead price forecasts; Deregulated markets; Mean absolute percentage error; Renewable generation; Short-term price forecasting; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets,5,1,"1, 2",1

The first question is timely and relevant because if the merit-order effect estimates are small, California's renewable energy development is of limited help in cutting electricity consumers' bills but also has a lesser adverse impact on the state's investment incentive for natural-gas-fired generation. The second question is related to the efficient market hypothesis under which the hourly RTM and DAM prices tend to converge. Using a sample of about 21,000 hourly observations of CAISO market prices and their fundamental drivers during 12/12/2012-04/30/2015, we document statistically significant estimates (p-value≤0.01) for the DAM and RTM merit-order effects. This finding lends support to California's adopted procurement process to provide sufficient investment incentives for natural-gas-fired generation. We document that the RTM-DAM price divergence partly depends on the CASIO's day-ahead forecast errors for system loads and renewable energy. This finding suggests that improving the performance of the CAISO's day-ahead forecasts can enhance trading efficiency in California's DAM and RTM electricity markets. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",California; Day-ahead market; Electricity prices; Merit-order effects; Real-time market; Renewable energy,Commerce; Costs; Dams; Electric utilities; Investments; Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; California; Day ahead market; Electricity prices; Ordering effects; Real-time market; Renewable energies; Power markets; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; energy policy; price dynamics; renewable resource; California; United States,4,1,"1, 2",1
"Hagfors L.I., Bunn D., Kristoffersen E., Staver T.T., Westgaard S.",Modeling the UK electricity price distributions using quantile regression,2016,23,"In this paper we develop fundamental quantile regression models for the UK electricity price in each trading period. Intraday properties of price risk, as represented by the predictive distribution rather than expected values, have previously not been fully analyzed. The sample covers half hourly data from 2005 to 2012. From our analysis we are able to show how the sensitivity towards different fundamental factors changes across quantiles and time of day. In the UK the supply of electricity is to a large extent generated from coal and gas plants, thus the price of gas and coal, as well as the carbon emission price, are included as fundamental factors in our model. We also include the electricity price lagged by one day, as well as demand and margin forecasts. We find that the sensitivities vary across the price distribution. Our findings also suggest that the sensitivity to fundamental factors exhibit intraday variation. We find that the sensitivity to gas relative to coal is higher in high quantiles and lower in low quantiles, as well as some indications of market power being exercised during peak hours. We have demonstrated a scenario analysis based on the quantile regression models, showing how changes in the values of the fundamentals influence the electricity price distribution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity markets; Prices; Quantile regression; Risk,Carbon; Coal; Commerce; Gas plants; Power markets; Regression analysis; Risks; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon emission prices; Electricity prices; Expected values; Predictive distributions; Prices; Quantile regression; Scenario analysis; Trading periods; Costs; carbon emission; demand analysis; energy market; power generation; price dynamics; pricing policy; regression analysis; risk assessment; United Kingdom,4,1,2,2
"Ortiz M., Ukar O., Azevedo F., Múgica A.",Price forecasting and validation in the Spanish electricity market using forecasts as input data,2016,15,"The electricity sector has been subjected to major changes in the last few years. Previously, there existed a regulated system where electric companies could know beforehand the amount of energy each generator would produce, hence basing their largely operational strategy on cost minimization in order to increase their profits. In Spain, from 1988 till 1997, electricity prices were established by the 'Marco Legal Estable' - Stable Legal Framework -, where the Ministry of Industry and Energy acknowledged the existence of certain generation costs related to each type of technology. It was an industrial sector with no actual competition and therefore, with very few controllable risks. In the aftermath of the electricity market liberalization competition and uncertainty arose. Electricity spot prices became highly volatile due to the specific characteristics of electricity as a commodity. Long-term contracts allowed for hedge funds to act against price fluctuation in the electricity market. As a consequence, developing an accurate electricity price forecasting model is an extremely difficult task for electricity market agents. This work aims to propose a methodology to improve the limitations of those methodologies just using historical data to forecast electricity prices. In this manner, and in order to gain access to more recent data, instead of using natural gas prices and electricity load historical data, a regression model to forecast the evolution of natural gas prices, and a model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to forecast electricity loads, are proposed. The results of these models are used as input for an electricity price forecast model. Finally, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, several study cases applied to the Spanish market, using real price data, are presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial neural network; Electricity markets; Price forecast; Regression model; Volatility,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Electric industry; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Natural gas; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Long-term contracts; Operational strategies; Price forecasts; Regression model; Spanish electricity markets; Volatility; Power markets,5,3,1,1

This paper presents such a model (named K-SVR). While yielding prediction accuracy comparable with the best known models in the literature, K-SVR requires a significantly reduced computational time. The computational reduction is attained by eliminating the use of a feature selection process, which is commonly used by the existing models in the literature. K-SVR is a hybrid model that combines clustering algorithms, support vector machine, and support vector regression. K-SVR is tested using Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland market data from the periods 2005-6, 2011-12, and 2014-15. Market data from 2006 has been used to measure performance of many of the existing models. Authors chose these models to compare performance and demonstrate strengths of K-SVR.

In this paper, therefore, the consequent part of the time series comprises the output from a functional link network that provides an expanded input dimension to handle the uncertainties and chaotic fluctuation of the time series databases.

"Bello A., Reneses J., Muñoz A.",Medium-term probabilistic forecasting of extremely low prices in electricity markets: Application to the Spanish case,2016,15,"One of the most relevant challenges that have arisen in electricity markets during the last few years is the emergence of extremely low prices. Trying to predict these events is crucial for market agents in a competitive environment. This paper proposes a novel methodology to simultaneously accomplish punctual and probabilistic hourly predictions about the appearance of extremely low electricity prices in a medium-term scope. The proposed approach for making real ex ante forecasts consists of a nested compounding of different forecasting techniques, which incorporate Monte Carlo simulation, combined with spatial interpolation techniques. The procedure is based on the statistical identification of the process key drivers. Logistic regression for rare events, decision trees, multilayer perceptrons and a hybrid approach, which combines a market equilibrium model with logistic regression, are used. Moreover, this paper assesses whether periodic models in which parameters switch according to the day of the week can be even more accurate. The proposed techniques are compared to a Markov regime switching model and several naive methods. The proposed methodology empirically demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving promising results on a real case study based on the Spanish electricity market. This approach can provide valuable information for market agents when they face decision making and risk-management processes.

Price forecasting is very important for online trading, e-commerce and power system operation.

The novel approach proposed in this paper for forecasting the electricity prices uses WLS technique and compares the results with the results obtained by using ANNs. To perform this price forecasting, the market knowledge is utilized to optimize the selection of input data for the electricity price forecasting tool. In this paper, price forecasting for Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection is demonstrated using the ANNs and the proposed WLS technique. The data used for this price forecasting is obtained from the PJM website. The forecasting results obtained by both methods are compared, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting approach. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the accuracy of prediction has increased in both seasons using the proposed WLS technique.

This paper places itself in price directed power systems, where participants respond with their load demand to incoming price signals. To that end, a two hour-ahead forecasting method using a linear composition of kernel machines for electricity prices is introduced. Initially, two kernel machines, i.e., a Gaussian process (GP) and a relevance vector machine (RVM), are utilized for next-two-hour prediction making. Subsequently, a linear predictor composed of the two kernel machines, which are both equipped with the Gaussian kernel, is built that integrates the individual predictions to provide a single one. The linear coefficients are obtained as the solution of multiobjective problem that is sought by a genetic algorithm utilizing Pareto optimality theory. Method testing is performed on a set of historical data obtained from the New England area.

In this article, we assess the forecasting ability of several classes of time-series models for electricity wholesale spot prices at a day-ahead horizon in France. Electricity spot prices display a strong seasonal pattern, particularly in France, given the high share of electric heating in housing during winter time. To deal with this pattern, we implement a double temporal segmentation of the data. For each trading period and season, we use a large number of specifications based on market fundamentals: linear regressions, Markov-switching (MS) models and threshold models with a smooth transition. An extensive evaluation on French data shows that modelling each season independently leads to better results. Among nonlinear models, MS models designed to capture the sudden and fast-reverting spikes in the price dynamics yield more accurate forecasts. Finally, pooling forecasts give more reliable results. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",combinations; electricity spot prices; Forecasting; regime-switching; seasonality,electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; Markov chain; modeling; price dynamics; seasonality; time series; France,3,1,1,1

Therefore, well-performing forecast methods for day-ahead electricity prices are essential for energy traders and supply companies.In this paper, a methodology based on artificial neuronal networks (ANN) is presented to forecast electricity prices. As the performance of an ANN forecast model depends on appropriate input parameter sets, the focus is set on the selection and preparation of fundamental data that has a noticeable impact on electricity prices. This is done with the help of different cluster algorithms, but also by comparing the results of the pre-selected model configurations in combination with different input parameter settings.

Comparisons of errors from different ISMPF models identified the most important variables for forecasting purposes. Similar analyses were applied to determine the best daily session models for price forecasts (DSMPF models) for the day-ahead price forecasting in the daily session of the MIBEL, considering as input variables extensive hourly time series records of recent prices, power demands and power generations in the previous day, forecasts of demand, wind power generation and weather for the day-ahead, and chronological variables. ISMPF models include the input variables of DSMPF models as well as the daily session prices and prices of preceding intraday sessions. The best ISMPF models achieved lower MAPEs for most of the intraday sessions compared to the error of the best DSMPF model; furthermore, such DSMPF error was very close to the lowest limit error for the daily session. The best ISMPF models can be useful for MIBEL agents of the electricity intraday market and the electric energy industry. © 2016 by the authors.",Daily session prices; Electricity market prices; Iberian electricity market (MIBEL); Intraday session prices; Short-term forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Errors; Forecasting; Neural networks; Time series analysis; Wind power; Analysis of means; Daily session prices; Electric energies; Forecasting purpose; Iberian electricity market; Intraday session prices; Short-term forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Power markets,5,1,"1, 2",1

The study is conducted over a 2-year long period, with hourly data of the prices to be predicted and a large set of variables used as predictors (i.e. historical prices, forecast load, wind and solar power forecasts, expected plenty or shortage of hydroelectric production, net transfer capacity available at the interconnections and the gas prices).

"Aghaebrahimi M.R., Taherian H.",Short-term price forecasting considering distributed generation in the price-sensitive environment of smart grids,2016,3,"In smart grids environment, all participants, including different load types, are able to utilize the network. Advances in measurement tools in these networks make it easy to move towards dynamic pricing and non-fixed electricity tariffs. In this environment, the forecasted electricity price is declared to wholesale and retail consumers via Advanced Measurement Instruments (AMI). Therefore, motivated by different factors such as optimizing the economic/environmental issues or increasing the reliability, the customers are able to react to prices and manage their consumption. This pattern of reaction brings about extensive changes in the load and price curves of the network. On the other hand, environmental concerns resulting from the use of fossil fuels have increased the exploitation of renewable energies. But, as the penetration of renewable energy sources increases, serious improvements and modifications for the existing electric grid are needed to accommodate and integrate these intermittent sources. In this paper, a hybrid model is presented for simultaneous short term forecasting of electricity prices considering Distributed Generation (DG) in the price-sensitive environment of smart grids. The proposed model combines the Support Vector Regression (SVR) network with an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) network, and it is capable of tracking customers' reaction to declared prices. This model is applied on the data of power markets of Nordpool regrion, Denmark, where the smart grids are very active. The results of short term price forecasting for a target day (1/1/2016) shows the accuracy of the model. © 2016 IEEE.",Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system; Distributed generation; Price-sensitive; Short-term price forecasting; Smart grids,Costs; Distributed power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS); Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Measurement instruments; Price sensitive; Renewable energy source; Short-term price forecasting; Smart grid; Support vector regression (SVR); Smart power grids,5,1,1,1
"Wang K., Xu C., Guo S.",Big data analytics for price forecasting in smart grids,2016,10,"Demand side management (DSM) is a key mechanism to make smart grids cost efficient using electricity price forecasting issue. Price forecasting method takes the big price data into account, and gives estimates of the future electricity price. However, most of existing price forecasting methods cannot avoid redundancy at feature selection and lack of an integrated framework that coordinates the steps in forecasting. To address this issue, we first propose a new electricity price forecasting framework. It is significant to design a system tool chain based on big data analytics for ensuring that the users can make appropriate decisions. To this end, three algorithms are proposed integratedly. First, feature redundancy elimination is implemented by the fusion of Grey Correlation Analysis (GCA) and ReliefF algorithm. Second, a combination of Kernel function and Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) is designed to achieve dimensionality reduction. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization algorithm based on differential evolution (DE) is proposed to forecast price classification. These three modules jointly power the price forecasting system.

"Mori H., Nakano K.",An Efficient Hybrid Intelligent Method for Electricity Price Forecasting,2016,1,"In this paper an efficient method is proposed for electricity price forecasting. This paper focuses on Locational Marginal Price (LMP) that efficiently maintains power markets by alleviating transmission network congestion. There are complicated behaviors of the time series due to uncertain factors in the power markets. From a standpoint of market players, a sophisticated method is required to forecast LMP effectively. The proposed method makes use of the hybridization of GP (Gaussian Process) of hierarchical Bayesian estimation, EPSO (Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization) of evolutionary computation and fuzzy c-means of allowing data to belong to two or more clusters. EPSO is used to improve the accuracy of parameters in MAP (Maximum a Posteriori) estimation for GP.

Hence, enhancement of forecasting approaches is required for all electricity market players to deal with the non-stationary and stochastic nature of such time series, making it possible to accurately support their decisions in a competitive environment with lower forecasting error and with an acceptable computational time. As previously published methodologies have shown, hybrid approaches are good candidates to overcome most of the previous concerns about time-series forecasting. In this sense, this paper proposes an enhanced hybrid approach composed of an innovative combination of wavelet transform (WT), differential evolutionary particle swarm optimization (DEEPSO), and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to forecast EMP signals in different electricity markets and wind power in Portugal, in the short-term, considering only historical data.

With this aim, research has evolved to model the particularities of electricity prices. In particular, dynamic factor models have been quite successful in the task, both in the short and long run. However, specifying a single model for the unobserved factors is difficult, and it cannot be guaranteed that such a model exists. In this paper, model averaging is employed to overcome this difficulty, with the expectation that electricity prices would be better forecast by a combination of models for the factors than by a single model.

Thus, in the electricity markets, accurate electricity price forecasting plays significant role for power producers and consumers. Although many studies developing and proposing highly accurate forecasting models exist in the literature, there have been few investigations on improving the forecasting effectiveness of electricity price from the perspective of reducing the volatility of data with satisfactory accuracy. Based on reducing the volatility of the electricity price and the forecasting nature of the radial basis function network (RBFN), this paper successfully develops a two-stage model to forecast the day-ahead electricity price, of which the first stage is particle swarm optimization (PSO)-core mapping (CM) with self-organizing-map and fuzzy set (PCMwSF), and the second stage is selection rule (SR). The PCMwSF stage applies CM, fuzzy set and optimized weights to obtain the future price, and the SR stage is inspired by the forecasting nature of RBFN and effectively selects the best forecast during the test period. The proposed model, i.e., CM-PCMwSF-SR, not only overcomes the difficulty of reducing the high volatility of the electricity price but also leads to a superior forecasting effectiveness than benchmarks. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reducing volatility; Selection rule (SR); Self-organizing-map,Commerce; Computer circuits; Conformal mapping; Costs; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; Self organizing maps; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting models; Highly accurate; Radial basis function Networks (RBFN); Reducing volatility; Selection Rules; Power markets,5,1,1,1

"Mori H., Nakano K.",EPSO-based Gaussian process for electricity price forecasting,2015,1,"In this paper, a new method is proposed for Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) forecasting in Smart Grid. The marginal cost is required to supply electric power to incremental loads in case where a certain node increases power demands in a balanced power system. LMP plays an important role to maintain economic efficiency in electric power markets in a way that electricity flows from a low-cost area to high-cost ones and the transmission network congestion is alleviated. The power market players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their aim is achieved. This paper presents the Gaussian Process (GP) technique that comes from the extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in which hierarchical Bayesian estimation is introduced to express the model parameters as the probabilistic variables. The advantage is that the model accuracy of GP is better than others. GP is integrated with k-means of clustering to improve the performance of GP. Also, this paper makes use of the Mahalanobis kernel in GP rather than the Gaussian one so that GP is generalized to approximate nonlinear systems. EPSO of evolutionary computation is applied to GP to determine the parameters of the kernel function.

"Grossi L., Nan F.",Robust smooth transition threshold autoregressive models for electricity prices,2015,3,"In this paper we suggest the use of robust STAR (Smooth Transition AutoRegressive) processes to model and forecast electricity prices observed on deregulated markets. The robustness of the model is achieved by extending to time series the M-type estimator based on the polynomial weighting function first introduced for independent multivariate data. The robust M-STAR estimator can be considered as a generalization of the robust SETAR estimator [1], because in STAR processes the change from one regime to another is ruled by a smooth function rather than by a fixed threshold. The main advantage of estimating robust STAR models is the possibility to capture two very well-known stylized facts of electricity prices: nonlinearity produced by changes of regimes and the presence of sudden spikes due to inelasticity of demand. The forecasting performance of the model is assessed through an application to the Italian electricity market (IPEX).

Nowakowska L.,Dynamic discrete model for electricity price forecasting,2015,4,"Price in the wholesale energy markets is established by matching supply (what generators want to sell) and demand (what utilities and customers want to buy). Developing the proper pricing strategies is becoming increasingly relevant to producers and consumers in the new competitive electric power markets. Price-forecasting tools are essential for all market participants for their survival under new deregulated environment. The goal of this paper is to construct a discrete dynamic model which can be used to forecast energy price in this kind of market. This mathematical model consists of four recursive, first-order equations describing current demand, forecasted demand and amount of energy being produced by generators. Based on this model the price for the next period can be calculated. The basic concepts such as changes of supply and demand and their influence on the market are firstly listed and described. It is also shown that this model is universal and providing necessary data can be applied to different energy market. © 2015 IEEE.",day-ahead electricity market; demand forecasting; dynamic discrete model; price forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Day-ahead electricity market; Demand forecasting; Deregulated environments; Discrete dynamic models; Discrete modeling; Electricity price forecasting; Price forecasting; Wholesale energy market; Power markets,1,1,1,1

A better forecast of market-clearing price (MCP) helps market participants to strategically set up their bidding strategies for energy markets in the short-term. This paper presents a new prediction strategy to improve the need for more accurate short-term price forecasting tool at spot market using an artificial neural networks (ANNs). To build the forecasting ANN model, a threelayered feedforward neural network trained by the improved Levenberg-marquardt (LM) algorithm is used to forecast the locational marginal prices (LMPs). To accurately predict LMPs, actual power generation and load are considered as the input sets, and then the difference is used to predict price differences in the spot market. The proposed ANN model generalizes the relationship between the LMP in each area and the unconstrained MCP during the same period of time. The LMP calculation is iterated so that the capacity between the areas is maximized and the mechanism itself helps to relieve grid congestion. The addition of flow between the areas gives the LMPs a new equilibrium point, which is balanced when taking the transfer capacity into account, LMP forecasting is then possible.

"Garciá-Martos C., Caro E., Jesús Sánchez M.",Electricity price forecasting accounting for renewable energies: Optimal combined forecasts,2015,2,"Electricity price forecasting is an interesting problem for all the agents involved in electricity market operation. For instance, every profit maximisation strategy is based on the computation of accurate one-day-ahead forecasts, which is why electricity price forecasting has been a growing field of research in recent years. In addition, the increasing concern about environmental issues has led to a high penetration of renewable energies, particularly wind. In some European countries such as Spain, Germany and Denmark, renewable energy is having a deep impact on the local power markets. In this paper, we propose an optimal model from the perspective of forecasting accuracy, and it consists of a combination of several univariate and multivariate time series methods that account for the amount of energy produced with clean energies, particularly wind and hydro, which are the most relevant renewable energy sources in the Iberian Market. This market is used to illustrate the proposed methodology, as it is one of those markets in which wind power production is more relevant in terms of its percentage of the total demand, but of course our method can be applied to any other liberalised power market. As far as our contribution is concerned, first, the methodology proposed by Garciá-Martos et al (2007 and 2012) is generalised twofold: we allow the incorporation of wind power production and hydro reservoirs, and we do not impose the restriction of using the same model for 24 h. A computational experiment and a Design of Experiments (DOE) are performed for this purpose. Then, for those hours in which there are two or more models without statistically significant differences in terms of their forecasting accuracy, a combination of forecasts is proposed by weighting the best models (according to the DOE) and minimising the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAPE is the most popular accuracy metric for comparing electricity price forecasting models. We construct the combination of forecasts by solving several nonlinear optimisation problems that allow computation of the optimal weights for building the combination of forecasts. The results are obtained by a large computational experiment that entails calculating out-of-sample forecasts for every hour in every day in the period from January 2007 to December 2009. In addition, to reinforce the value of our methodology, we compare our results with those that appear in recent published works in the field. This comparison shows the superiority of our methodology in terms of forecasting accuracy. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.

In fact, in this environment, the electricity price and load consumption are highly corrected such that the market participants will have complex model in their decisions to maximize their profit. Although the available forecasting mythologies perform well in electricity market by way of little or no load and price interdependencies, but cannot capture load and price dynamics if they exist. To overcome this shortage, a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model is presented which can consider the correlation between electricity price and load. The proposed model consists of three components known as a Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) to make valuable subsets, Generalized Mutual Information (GMI) to select best input candidate and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) based on MIMO model, called LSSVM-MIMO, to make simultaneous load and price forecasts. Moreover, the LSSVM-MIMO parameters are optimized by a novel Quasi-Oppositional Artificial Bee Colony (QOABC) algorithm.

"Kalczynski P., Zerom D.",Price forecast valuation for the nyiso electricity market,2015,,"Purpose – Following the deregulation of electricity markets in the USA, independent power producers operate as for-profit entities. Their profit depends on the price of electricity and an accurate forecast is critical in making bidding decisions on the electricity and reserve markets or engaging in bilateral contracts. Competing price forecasts have their accuracy expressed in statistical terms but producers need to determine the long-term value of using a given forecast. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue by presenting a method of electricity price forecast valuation which compares forecast models using financial rather than statistical measures. Design/methodology/approach – The objectives of this paper are achieved by mathematical modeling of thermal power plants and price forecast information available to market participants and simulating the operation of a thermal power plant using various price forecasts and perfect information (as a baseline). The operating profit calculated over a long period was used for ranking forecast models. Findings – The framework can be used to estimate the value of a new price forecast as well as to determine if potential gains from developing or acquiring a new forecast will justify the expenses. The results show that an improvement in terms of statistical forecast accuracy measures does not guarantee increased profit. Practical implications – This paper presents a new method for comparing electricity price forecast models. It can be adapted to various types of thermal power plants that operate on liberalized electricity markets and utilize price-based dynamic economic dispatch models. Originality/value – This paper presents a simulation-based valuation framework for short-term electricity price.

Power producers and customers use short term price forecasts to manage and plan for bidding approaches, and hence increasing the utility's profit and energy efficiency as well. The main challenge in forecasting electricity price is when dealing with non-stationary and high volatile price series.

This study presents a hybrid price forecasting framework based on a new data fusion algorithm. Owing to the complexity and distinct nature of the electricity price, a single forecast engine cannot capture all different patterns of the price signals. Hence, this study focuses on a hybrid forecasting method to extract the advantages of several forecasting engines. In the proposed method, artificial neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and autoregressive moving average are employed as primary forecast engines (agents) which provide three independent price forecasts.

Hence, this paper presents a new hybrid evolutionary-adaptive approach for wind power and electricity market prices prediction, in the short-term, based on mutual information, wavelet transform, evolutionary particle swarm optimization and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, tested on real case studies, proving its superiority in a comprehensive comparison with other approaches previously published in the scientific literature. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.",Evolutionary particle swarm optimization; Forecasting; Market prices; Neuro-fuzzy system; Wind power,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Wavelet transforms; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Comprehensive comparisons; Evolutionary particle swarm optimizations; Liberalized electricity market; Market price; Neurofuzzy system; Scientific literature; Short-Term wind power predictions; Smart power grids,5,"1, 2",1,1

This approach combines ARIMA and NN models in a cascaded structure and uses explanatory variables. A two step procedure is applied. In the first step, the explanatory variables are predicted. In the second one, the energy prices are forecasted by using the explanatory variables prediction. The prediction time horizon is 12 weeks-ahead and is applied to the North Brazilian submarket, which adopts a cost-based model with unique characteristics of price behavior.

Load and Price Forecasting are two such important tools in the electricity market that help in performing essential tasks such as unit commitment of generating capacity, resource planning, cash flow analysis for stakeholders etc. This paper presents a new ANN model for hourly load and price forecasting. Since there are variations in demand throughout the day, a model needs to be devised to predict these variations. In this paper, Fourier analysis of the load and price signal has been done to find out the dominant features of these signals. These features are then fed to a Multi-layer Feed Forward Neural Network. The ANN model is trained on hourly data from ISO New England electricity market from the year 2007 to 2011 and tested on out-of-sample data from the year 2012.

"Mori H., Nakano K.",Application of Gaussian process to locational marginal pricing forecasting,2014,3,"In this paper, a new method is proposed for Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) forecasting in Smart Grid. The marginal cost is required to supply electricity to incremental loads in case where a certain node increases power demands in a balanced power system. LMP plays an important role to maintain economic efficiency in power markets in a way that electricity flows from a low-cost area to high-cost one and the transmission network congestion is alleviated. The power market players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their desire is reflected. This paper presents the Gaussian Process (GP) technique that comes from the extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in a way that hierarchical Bayesian estimation is introduced to express the model parameter as the stochastic variables. The advantage is that the model accuracy of GP is better than others.

After removing the effects of outliers, we compare the out-of-sample forecasting performance for three categories of long-term seasonality models: dummies, Fourier series, and wavelet-based methods.

Accurate forecasting is regarded as the most practical way to win power bid in today's highly competitive electricity market. Comparing with existing price forecasting methods, random forest, as a newly introduced method, will provide a price probability distribution, which will allow the users to estimate the risks of their bidding strategy and also making the results helpful for later industrial using. Furthermore, the model can adjust to the latest forecasting condition, i.e. The latest climatic, seasonal and market condition, by updating the random forest parameters with new observations. This adaptability avoids the model failure in a climatic or economic condition different from the training set.

"Wang Z., Liu F., Wu J., Wang J.",A hybrid forecasting model based on bivariate division and a backpropagation artificial neural network optimized by chaos particle swarm optimization for day-ahead electricity price,2014,11,"In the electricity market, the electricity price plays an inevitable role. Nevertheless, accurate price forecasting, a vital factor affecting both government regulatory agencies and public power companies, remains a huge challenge and a critical problem. Determining how to address the accurate forecasting problem becomes an even more significant task in an era in which electricity is increasingly important. Based on the chaos particle swarm optimization (CPSO), the backpropagation artificial neural network (BPANN), and the idea of bivariate division, this paper proposes a bivariate division BPANN (BD-BPANN) method and the CPSO-BD-BPANN method for forecasting electricity price. The former method creatively transforms the electricity demand and price to be a new variable, named DV, which is calculated using the division principle, to forecast the day-ahead electricity by multiplying the forecasted values of the DVs and forecasted values of the demand. Next, to improve the accuracy of BD-BPANN, chaos particle swarm optimization and BD-BPANN are synthesized to form a novel model, CPSO-BD-BPANN. In this study, CPSO is utilized to optimize the initial parameters of BD-BPANN to make its output more stable than the original model. Finally, two forecasting strategies are proposed regarding different situations. © 2014 Zhilong Wang et al.",,,5,1,1,1
"Wu L., Shahidehpour M.",A hybrid model for integrated day-ahead electricity price and load forecasting in smart grid,2014,37,"Load and price forecasting are two key issues for market participants and system operators in electricity markets. Most existing works predict load and price separately. However, a dynamic pricing type scenario is envisioned in smart grid, where consumers may have the ability to react to constantly changing price signals by shifting electricity usages from expensive hours to others, which would consequently impact electricity prices. Thus, price and load signals are strongly coupled, and previous separated forecast models may not be as effective. In this study, a two-stage integrated price and load forecasting framework is developed. The first stage provides initial price and load forecasts separately, and the second stage considers load and price interaction with initial forecasts as inputs. At each stage, a hybrid time-series and adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) model is used, in which multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average catches the linear relationship of price and load log return series, generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic unveils heteroscedastic character of residuals and AWNN presents non-linear impacts. Several criteria such as average mean absolute percentage error and error variance are used to measure the forecasting accuracy.

The deregulation of electricity markets stimulated investments in the production and distribution of energy, but there are large risks associated with these investments due to price volatility. The paper in the introduction describes the algorithm that governs the operation of the Day- Ahead Market in the Italian Power Exchange and proposes an econometric model for short-term forecasting (six months or a year) of the daily Single National Price (Prezzo Unico Nazionale, PUN) of electricity. The model includes constants, regressors, moving averages, weekly and seasonal dummies, autoregressive and heteroschedastic variables. The results show a significant decrease in error of the short-term forecast of the analyzed time series, in comparison with the method of linear least squares, traditionally used in literature. An analysis on the influence of different variables on PUN such as brent, solar radiation and weather has been reported.

"Carpio J., Juan J., López D.",Multivariate exponential smoothing and dynamic factor model applied to hourly electricity price analysis,2014,9,"Thanks to its very simple recursive computing scheme, exponential smoothing has become a popular technique to forecast time series. In this work, we show the advantages of its multivariate version and present some properties of the model, which allows us to perform a dynamic factor analysis. This analysis leads to a simple methodology to reduce the number of parameters (useful when the dimension of observations is large) via a linear transformation that decomposes the multivariate process into independent univariate exponential smoothing processes, characterized by a single smoothing parameter that goes from zero (white-noise process) to one (random walk process). A computer implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm has been built for the maximum likelihood estimation of the models. The practicality of the method is demonstrated by its application to hourly electricity price predictions in some day-ahead markets, such as Omel, Powernext, and Nord Pool markets, whose forecasts are given as examples.

MRS models offer the possibility to divide the time series into different regimes with different underlying processes. RT is a data driven technique aiming in finding a classifier that performs an average guessing for the response variable in question, which is the short term electricity spot price. We use a dataset consisting of average day ahead spot electricity prices for the MRS model. Then, we use hourly data to build the RT model. The empirical evidence supports that the regression tree approach outperforms the MRS model. We also compare the forecasting accuracy of the regression tree model by incorporating different predictors sets for electricity prices and logarithmic electricity prices.

These scenarios are most likely to be generated based on marginal predictive densities for such prices, then enhanced with a temporal dependence structure. A semi-parametric methodology for generating such densities is presented: it includes: (i) a time-adaptive quantile regression model for the 5%-95% quantiles; and (ii) a description of the distribution tails with exponential distributions.

While all benchmarks are outperformed in terms of forecasting skill overall, the superiority of the semi-parametric model over the GARCH model lies in the former's ability to generate reliable quantile estimates. © 2014 by the authors.",Density forecasting; Electricity prices; Non-stationarity; Quantile regression; Stochastic processes,Costs; Decision making; Forecasting; Random processes; Regression analysis; Stochastic systems; Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Day-ahead electricity market; Density forecasting; Electricity prices; Exponential distributions; Non-stationarities; Quantile regression; Semi-parametric modeling; Power markets,4,1,1,2
"Young D., Poletti S., Browne O.",Can agent-based models forecast spot prices in electricity markets? Evidence from the New Zealand electricity market,2014,11,"Modelling price formation in electricity markets is a notoriously difficult process, due to physical constraints on electricity generation and transmission, and the potential for market power. This difficulty has inspired the recent development of bottom-up agent-based algorithmic learning models of electricity markets. While these have proven quite successful in small models, few authors have attempted any validation of their model against real-world data in a more realistic model. In this paper we develop the SWEM model, where we take one of the most promising algorithms from the literature, a modified version of the Roth and Erev algorithm, and apply it to a 19-node simplification of the New Zealand electricity market. Once key variables such as water storage are accounted for, we show that our model can closely mimic short-run (weekly) electricity prices at these 19 nodes, given fundamental inputs such as fuel costs, network data, and demand. We show that agents in SWEM are able to manipulate market power when a line outage makes them an effective monopolist in the market. SWEM has already been applied to a wide variety of policy applications in the New Zealand market.22. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based modelling; Electricity markets; Power trading,Computational methods; Costs; Digital storage; Electric industry; Fuel storage; Outages; Agent-based model; Agent-based modelling; Algorithmic learning; Electricity generation; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Physical constraints; Power trading; New zealand; Spot price; Commerce; algorithm; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; model validation; modeling; price dynamics; electricity generation; energy policy; New Zealand,1,3,1,1

Therefore, electricity price is a key element in optimum demand side management (DSM) in this environment. Accurate short-term forecasting of electricity price is of great importance for the market participants.

Elattar E.E.,Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets based on local informative vector machine,2013,20,"In a competitive electricity market, short-term electricity price forecasting are very important for market participants. Electricity price is a very complex signal as a result of its non-linearity, non-stationarity and time-variant behaviour. This study presents a new approach to short-term electricity price forecasting. The proposed method is derived by integrating the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method with the local informative vector machine (IVM), which can be derived by combining the IVM with the local regression method. IVM is a practical probabilistic alternative to the popular support vector machine. Local prediction makes use of similar historical data patterns in the reconstructed space to train the regression algorithm. In the proposed method, KPCA is used to extract features of the inputs and obtain kernel principal components for constructing the phase space of the time series of the inputs.

"Nowotarski J., Tomczyk J., Weron R.",Robust estimation and forecasting of the long-term seasonal component of electricity spot prices,2013,46,"We present the results of an extensive study on estimation and forecasting of the long-term seasonal component (LTSC) of electricity spot prices. We consider a battery of over 300 models, including monthly dummies and models based on Fourier or wavelet decomposition combined with linear or exponential decay. We find that the considered wavelet-based models are significantly better in terms of forecasting spot prices up to a year ahead than the commonly used monthly dummies and sine-based models. This result questions the validity and usefulness of stochastic models of spot electricity prices built on the latter two types of LTSC models. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity spot price; Forecasting; Long-term seasonal component; Robust modeling; Wavelets,Electricity spot price; Exponential decays; Long-term seasonal component; Robust estimation; Robust modeling; Spot electricity prices; Spot price; Wavelets; Electricity spot price; Exponential decays; Long-term seasonal component; Robust estimation; Robust modeling; Spot electricity prices; Wavelet based models; Wavelets; Electricity; Forecasting; Wavelet decomposition; Costs; Forecasting; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Costs; Stochastic models; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy market; forecasting method; modeling; price dynamics; electricity; energy market; forecasting method; modeling; wavelet analysis,4,3,1,1

"Muñoz M.P., Corchero C., Heredia F.-J.",Improving electricity market price forecasting with factor models for the optimal generation bid,2013,4,"In liberalized electricity markets, the electricity generation companies usually manage their production by developing hourly bids that are sent to the day-ahead market. As the prices at which the energy will be purchased are unknown until the end of the bidding process, forecasting of spot prices has become an essential element in electricity management strategies. In this article, we apply forecasting factor models to the market framework in Spain and Portugal and study their performance. Although their goodness of fit is similar to that of autoregressive integrated moving average models, they are easier to implement. The second part of the paper uses the spot-price forecasting model to generate inputs for a stochastic programming model, which is then used to determine the company's optimal generation bid. The resulting optimal bidding curves are presented and analyzed in the context of the Iberian day-ahead electricity market. © 2013 International Statistical Institute.",Electricity market prices; Factor models; Price scenarios; Short-term forecasting; Stochastic programming,,4,1,1,1
"Miranian A., Abdollahzade M., Hassani H.",Day-ahead electricity price analysis and forecasting by singular spectrum analysis,2013,28,"This study proposes a model-free approach for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. The proposed approached is based on the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique. The SSA is a relatively new and powerful technique in time series analysis and forecasting thanks to its well-known capabilities in extracting the main structure of the broad classes of the time series. In this study, it is shown that SSA can be employed to decompose the original electricity price series into trend, periodic and noisy components. The main part of the price series, that is, the trend and harmonic components, is reconstructed by removing the noise component from the original series. The reconstructed price series is then used for forecasting the day-ahead electricity prices. The proposed approach is evaluated by analysing and forecasting of the dayahead electricity prices in the Australian and Spanish electricity markets. The forecasting results confirm the superiority of the SSA approach compared with some of the recently published forecasting techniques. ©The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",,Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price series; Electricity prices; Forecasting techniques; Harmonic components; Noise components; Singular spectrum analysis; Spanish electricity markets; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Forecasting; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Costs,4,1,1,1

Here, we propose a new goodness-of-fit testing scheme for the marginal distribution of such models. We consider models with an observable (like threshold autoregressions) as well as a latent state process (like Markov regime-switching). The test is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov supremum-distance statistic and the concept of the weighted empirical distribution function. The motivation for this research comes from a recent stream of literature in energy economics concerning electricity spot price models. While the existence of distinct regimes in such data is generally unquestionable (due to the supply stack structure), the actual goodness-of-fit of the models requires statistical validation. We illustrate the proposed scheme by testing whether commonly used Markov regime-switching models fit deseasonalized electricity prices from the NEPOOL (US) day-ahead market. © 2012 The Author(s).",Energy economics; Goodness-of-fit; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Regime-switching; Weighted empirical distribution function,,3,3,1,1
Cifter A.,Forecasting electricity price volatility with the Markov-switching GARCH model: Evidence from the Nordic electric power market,2013,38,"In this paper, electricity price behavior in the Nordic electric power market is forecasted with both the Markov-switching generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MS-GARCH) model and a set of different volatility models. The MS-GARCH model is estimated with two regimes, representing periods of low and high volatility. This study shows that electricity price volatility is not only highly volatile but also strongly regime-dependent. The empirical results show that the MS-GARCH model enables more accurate forecasting than the standard GARCH models, according to tail loss and reality check tests for one- and multi-step ahead forecasts. The results suggest that both the electricity generation companies and consumers of electricity could carry out better price forecasts by using the proposed MS-GARCH model. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Eichler M., Türk D.",Fitting semiparametric Markov regime-switching models to electricity spot prices,2013,14,"Recently regime-switching models have become the standard tool for modeling electricity prices. These models capture the main properties of electricity spot prices well but estimation of the model parameters requires computer intensive methods. Moreover, the distribution of the price spikes must be fully specified although the high volatility of the spikes makes it difficult to check such distributional assumptions. Consequently, there are a number of competing proposals for the distribution in the spike regime. As an alternative, we propose a semiparametric Markov regime-switching model that leaves the distribution under the spike regime unspecified. We show that the model parameters can be estimated by employing robust statistical techniques. This presents an alternative to the existing estimation methods that are based on computer intensive numerical maximization of the likelihood function. The model in combination with the estimation framework is easier to estimate, needs less computation time and distributional assumptions. To show its advantages we compare the proposed model with a well-established Markov regime-switching model in a simulation study. Furthermore, we apply the model to log-prices for the Australian electricity market. The results are in accordance with the results from the simulation study, indicating that the proposed model might be advantageous whenever the distribution of the spike process is not sufficiently known. The results are thus encouraging and suggest the use of our approach when modeling electricity prices and pricing derivatives. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity spot prices; Markov regime-switching; Mean-reversion; Robust estimation; Semiparametric estimation; Simulation study,Electricity spot price; Markov regime-switching; Mean-reversion; Robust estimation; Semi parametric estimation; Simulation studies; Computer simulation; Costs; Electric properties; Electricity; Estimation; Numerical methods; Parameter estimation; computer simulation; electricity generation; energy market; estimation method; Markov chain; numerical model; price dynamics; Australia,3,1,1,1
"Li X.R., Yu C.W., Ren S.Y., Chiu C.H., Meng K.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting based on panel cointegration and particle filter,2013,28,"An accurate forecasting of energy price is important for generation companies (GENCOs) to develop their bidding strategies or to make investment decisions. Nowadays, day-ahead electricity market is closely associated with other commodity markets such as fuel market and emission market. Under such an environment, day-ahead electricity price is volatile and its volatility changes overtime due to the uncertainties from the multi-market. This paper proposes a two-stage hybrid model based on panel cointegration and particle filter (PCPF). Panel cointegration (PC) model, which utilizes information of both the inter-temporal dynamics and the individuality of interconnected regions, provides powerful forecasting tool for electricity price. Particle filter (PF) has achieved significant successes in tracking applications involving non-Gaussian signals and nonlinear systems. This paper has two main focuses: (1) To expand the dimension of electricity price dataset from time series to panel data so that the dynamics of interconnected regions can be analyzed simultaneously and considered as a whole. (2) Regarding the model coefficients as a time-varying process, PF is used to forecast electricity price adaptively. In the case study, the proposed PCPF model is applied to the real electricity market data of PJM in the year 2008.

"Anbazhagan S., Kumarappan N.",Day-ahead deregulated electricity market price forecasting using recurrent neural network,2013,86,"This paper proposes a recurrent neural network model for the day ahead deregulated electricity market price forecasting that could be realized using the Elman network. In a deregulated market, electricity price is influenced by many factors and exhibits a very complicated and irregular fluctuation. Both power producers and consumers need a single compact and robust price forecasting tool for maximizing their profits and utilities. In order to validate the chaotic characteristic of electricity price, an Elman network is modeled. The proposed Elman network is a single compact and robust architecture (without hybridizing the various hard and soft computing models). It has been observed that a nearly state of the art Elman network forecasting accuracy can be achieved with less computation time. The proposed Elman network approach is compared with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), mixed model, neural network, wavelet ARIMA, weighted nearest neighbors, fuzzy neural network, hybrid intelligent system, adaptive wavelet neural network, neural networks with wavelet transform, wavelet transform and a hybrid of neural networks and fuzzy logic, wavelet-ARIMA radial basis function neural networks, cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm, and wavelet transform, particle swarm optimization, and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system approaches to forecast the electricity market of mainland Spain.

Firstly several single models were built to forecast the electricity price separately. Then the validation errors from every individual model were transformed into two discrete sequences: an emission sequence and a state sequence to build the HMM, obtaining a transmission matrix and an emission matrix, representing the forecasting ability state of the individual models. The combining weights of the individual models were decided by the state transmission matrixes in HMM and the best predict sample ratio of each individual among all the models in the validation set. The individual forecasts were averaged to get the combining forecast with the weights obtained above. The residuals of combining forecast were calibrated by the possible error calculated by the emission matrix of HMM. A case study of day-ahead electricity market of Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), USA, suggests that the proposed method outperforms individual techniques of price forecasting, such as support vector machine (SVM), generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), day-ahead modeling, and self-organized map (SOM) similar days modeling. © 2013 Da Liu et al.",,Costs; Electric load forecasting; Errors; Hidden Markov models; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Combined forecasts; Combining forecasts; Day-ahead electricity market; Forecasting ability; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Individual modeling; Self-organized map; Transmission matrix; Forecasting,3,1,1,1

The normal price module is a mixture of wavelet transform, linear AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and nonlinear neural network models. The probability of a price spike occurrence is produced by a compound classifier in which three single classification techniques are used jointly to make a decision. Combined with the spike value prediction technique, the output from the price spike module aims to provide a comprehensive price spike forecast. The overall electricity price forecast is formed as combined normal price and price spike forecasts. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated with real data from the Finnish Nord Pool Spot day-ahead energy market.

"Bordignon S., Bunn D.W., Lisi F., Nan F.",Combining day-ahead forecasts for British electricity prices,2013,79,"This paper considers how well the approach of combining forecasts extends to the context of electricity prices. With the increasing popularity of regime switching and time-varying parameter models for predicting power prices, the multi model and evolutionary considerations that usually support the combining of simpler time series methods may be less applicable when the individual models incorporate these features. We address this question with a backtesting analysis on British day-ahead prices. Furthermore, given the volatility of power prices and concerns about accurate forecasting under extreme price excursions, we evaluate the results using various error metrics including expected shortfall. The comparisons are furthermore carefully simulated to consider model selection uncertainty in order to realistically test the value of combining as an ex ante policy.

"Hong Y.-Y., Wu C.-P.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using a hybrid principal component analysis network,2012,35,"Bidding competition is one of the main transaction approaches in a deregulated electricity market. Locational marginal prices (LMPs) resulting from bidding competition and system operation conditions indicate electricity values at a node or in an area. The LMP reveals important information for market participants in developing their bidding strategies. Moreover,LMP is also a vital indicator for the Security Coordinator to perform market redispatch for congestion management. This paper presents a method using a principal component analysis (PCA) network cascaded with a multi-layer feedforward (MLF) network for forecasting LMPs in a day-ahead market. The PCA network extracts essential features from periodic information in the market. These features serve as inputs to the MLF network for forecasting LMPs.

"Menniti D., Scordino N., Sorrentino N.",A novel approach to forecast day-ahead electricity prices by means of neural networks using groups of similar hours,2012,1,"Forecasting short-term electricity market prices has been the focus of several studies in recent years. Although various approaches have been examined, achieving sufficiently low forecasting errors has not always been possible. However, certain applications, such as demandside management, do not require exact values for future prices, but utilize average values as the basis for making short-term scheduling decisions. With the aim of enhancing the accuracy of the day-ahead electricity price forecasting, field records of the Italian electricity market have been correlated so as to identify a number of blocks of hours, characterized by similarity of price. This paper thus proposes an approach to forecast the day-ahead electricity prices by means of a number of Neural Networks (NNs), with such a number being equal to the number of groups of hours with similarity of price, and with each NN forecasting the mean price over the hours belonging to the related group, as previously determined. Simulation results show that the fundamental and novel contribution of identifying, firstly, the membership of an hour to a particular group of hours, clustered according to their similarity of price, and then forecasting day-ahead prices for the resulting number of groups of hours performs fairly well if compared with other forecasting techniques, either on an hourly or on an average basis, in terms of mean absolute and absolute percentage errors, as well as of variance. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.",Back propagation; Electricity market prices; Forecasting; Neural network; Time series,,5,1,1,1

Serinaldi F.,"Distributional modeling and short-term forecasting of electricity prices by Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape",2011,47,"In the context of the liberalized and deregulated electricity markets, price forecasting has become increasingly important for energy company's plans and market strategies. Within the class of the time series models that are used to perform price forecasting, the subclasses of methods based on stochastic time series and causal models commonly provide point forecasts, whereas the corresponding uncertainty is quantified by approximate or simulation-based confidence intervals. Aiming to improve the uncertainty assessment, this study introduces the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) to model the dynamically varying distribution of prices. The GAMLSS allow fitting a variety of distributions whose parameters change according to covariates via a number of linear and nonlinear relationships. In this way, price periodicities, trends and abrupt changes characterizing both the position parameter (linked to the expected value of prices), and the scale and shape parameters (related to price volatility, skewness, and kurtosis) can be explicitly incorporated in the model setup. Relying on the past behavior of the prices and exogenous variables, the GAMLSS enable the short-term (one-day ahead) forecast of the entire distribution of prices. The approach was tested on two datasets from the widely studied California Power Exchange (CalPX) market, and the less mature Italian Power Exchange (IPEX). CalPX data allow comparing the GAMLSS forecasting performance with published results obtained by different models. The study points out that the GAMLSS framework can be a flexible alternative to several linear and nonlinear stochastic models. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity market price; GAMLSS models; Interval forecasting; Liberalized energy markets; Point forecasting,Electricity market; Energy markets; GAMLSS models; Interval forecasting; Point forecasting; Commerce; Computer simulation; Costs; Deregulation; Electricity; Forecasting; Statistical methods; Stochastic systems; Time series; Stochastic models; assessment method; commodity price; electricity generation; energy market; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; stochasticity; time series analysis; uncertainty analysis,4,1,1,2
"Cruz A., Muñoz A., Zamora J.L., Espínola R.",The effect of wind generation and weekday on Spanish electricity spot price forecasting,2011,68,"This paper empirically compares the predictive accuracy of a set of methods for day-ahead spot price forecasting in the Spanish electricity market. The methods come from time series analysis and artificial intelligence disciplines, and include univariate, multivariate, linear and nonlinear. Within the univariate methods, the double seasonal ARIMA and the recently proposed exponential smoothing for double seasonality are compared and used as benchmarks. They allow us to quantify the improvement on price forecasting when including explanatory variables or using more complex models. Dynamic regression models including the electricity load forecast are then considered. Their good performance in price forecasting has been pointed out by many authors. However, we find evidences of their predictive accuracy can be significantly outperformed by accounting the wind generation forecast provided by the System Operator. Moreover, these forecasts can be even more accurate if changes of price's behavior according with the day of the week are taken into account by means of periodic models.

However, price series usually have a complex behavior due to their nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variancy. In this paper, a novel hybrid method to forecast day-ahead electricity price is proposed.

Therefore, generation companies need accurate price forecasting tools. Comparison of neural network and auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to forecast commodity prices in pervious researches showed that the artificial neural network (ANN) forecasts were considerably more accurate than traditional ARIMA models. This paper provides an accurate and efficient tool for shortterm price forecasting based on the combination of ANN and ARIMA. Firstly, input variables for ANN are determined by time series analysis. This model relates the current prices to the values of past prices. Secondly, ANN is used for one day-ahead price forecasting. A three-layered feed-forward neural network algorithm is used for forecasting next-day electricity prices. The ANN model is then trained and tested using data from electricity market of Iran. According to pervious studies, in the case of neural networks and ARIMA models, historical demand data do not significantly improve predictions. The results show that the combined ANN-ARIMA forecasts prices with high accuracy for short-term periods. Also, it is shown that policy-making strategies would be enhanced due to increased precision and reliability.

In this work applications of various models were applied to national electricity market of Singapore (NEMS), i.e. Asia's first liberalized electricity market. The individual price of year 2006 is very volatile with a very wide range. Therefore, accurate forecasting models are required for Singapore electricity market company (EMC) to maximize their profits and for consumers to maximize their utilities. Hence the year 2006 has been taken for forecasting the uniform Singapore electricity price (USEP). The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) results show that the proposed CFNN model possess better forecasting abilities than the other models and its performance was least affected by the volatility. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Cascade-forward neural network (CFNN); Generalized regression neural network (GRNN); Levenberg-marquardt (LM) algorithm; National electricity market of singapore (NEMS); Price forecasting; Uniform singapore energy price (USEP),Commerce; Costs; Deep neural networks; Electric industry; Electromagnetic compatibility; Forecasting; Network layers; Neural networks; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; National electricity market of singapore (NEMS); Price forecasting; Uniform singapore energy prices (USEP); Power markets,5,2,1,1
"Sun Y., Bansal R.C., Bhardwaj A.K., Srivastava A.K.",Electricity market price forecasting using support vector machines,2011,3,"Due to the electricity market deregulation, the techniques used for load forecasting have gradually improved over the years. Deregulation in the power system industry has caused rising requirement in planning, operating and controlling electric energy systems, which brings electricity load forecasting to a crucial level. Therefore, adequate techniques are desired for accurately predicting the load and hence assisting power companies in generating capacity scheduling, maintenance, energy planning and procurement, etc. An accurate forecast can greatly help power distribution companies to improve their electricity marketing strategies and avoid over or under unitisation of generating capacity and therefore optimises energy prices. But, to predict the load demand in real time requires a considerable amount of efforts. This paper presents a design methodology for a short term load forecasting useful for distribution companies, which are capable of interacting with users, gathering historical load data, performing a statistical analysis on the historical data and plotting graphs of the predicted load using the support vector machine (SVM). SVM is the chosen forecasting technique because many studies have concluded that SVMs produce the optimum accuracy as compared to other methods such as Naive Bayesian, but SVM has not been optimised for the domain. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",deregulation; load forecasting; short term load forecasting; STLF; support vector machine; SVM,,5,1,1,1
"Li X.I., Yu C.W., Ren S., Meng K., Liu G.",Day-ahead electricity market price forecasting based on panel cointegration,2010,3,"This paper proposes a novel technique to forecast day-ahead electricity prices based on Panel Cointegration (PC). The current researches on the electricity price forecasting focus on the analysis of unstable economic time series. However, due to the difference of the allocation of power resource and consumption in different regions, the time series of electricity consumption and sales price in a single region cannot contain all information in different regions. In view of the disadvantages of the time series, the panel data is introduced to investigate the long-term equilibrium relationship and the short-term adjustment relationship between electricity consumption and sales price in the paper. The fundamental and novel contribution of the paper is to apply the PC to forecast accurately in day-ahead energy market price. The whole forecasting framework shows the use of PC model in predicting price behavior.

Due to the day-time variations in load and thereby electrical energy price, it is wise to use different models for forecasting energy price at different hours. In this paper, three different single-hour models are used to forecast electricity price at off peak, plateau, and peak load. A 24-hour model is also used to forecast electricity price of all hours simultaneously. Analysis of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions suggests different models for each single hour model as well as the 24-hour model. The best models for off peak, plateau, and peak load are obtained to be ARIMA(1,1,1), ARIMA(2,1,1) and ARIMA(0,1,1), respectively. In addition, the time-series analyses result in an AR(2) model with 24-hour period for the 24-hour model as the most suitable model. The models are compared from viewpoints of accuracy and time consuming. The comparison shows that the user should compromise between accuracy and speed, when selecting singlehour or 24-hour models. ©2010 IEEE.",Autocorrelation; Electrical energy; Forecasting; Partial autocorrelation; Time series,Best model; Electrical energy; Electricity prices; Energy prices; Partial autocorrelation; Partial autocorrelation function; Peak load; Power markets; Time variations; Adaptive filtering; Autocorrelation; Costs; Harmonic analysis; Regression analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Electric load forecasting,4,1,1,1

"Erlwein C., Benth F.E., Mamon R.",HMM filtering and parameter estimation of an electricity spot price model,2010,35,"In this paper we develop a model for electricity spot price dynamics. The spot price is assumed to follow an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with an added compound Poisson process. In this way, the model allows for mean-reversion and possible jumps. All parameters are modulated by a hidden Markov chain in discrete time. They are able to switch between different economic regimes representing the interaction of various factors. Through the application of reference probability technique, adaptive filters are derived, which in turn, provide optimal estimates for the state of the Markov chain and related quantities of the observation process. The EM algorithm is applied to find optimal estimates of the model parameters in terms of the recursive filters. We implement this self-calibrating model on a deseasonalised series of daily spot electricity prices from the Nordic exchange Nord Pool.

"Niu D., Liu D., Wu D.D.",A soft computing system for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2010,47,"Hourly energy prices in a competitive electricity market are volatile. Forecast of energy price is key information to help producers and purchasers involved in electricity market to prepare their corresponding bidding strategies so as to maximize their profits. It is difficult to forecast all the hourly prices with only one model for different behaviors of different hourly prices. Neither will it get excellent results with 24 different models to forecast the 24 hourly prices respectively, for there are always not sufficient data to train the models, especially the peak price in summer. This paper proposes a novel technique to forecast day-ahead electricity prices based on Self-Organizing Map neural network (SOM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. SOM is used to cluster the data automatically according to their similarity to resolve the problem of insufficient training data. SVM models for regression are built on the categories clustered by SOM separately. Parameters of the SVM models are chosen by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automatically to avoid the arbitrary parameters decision of the tester, improving the forecasting accuracy.

RNN is a multi-step approach based on one output node, which uses the previous prediction as input for the subsequent forecasts. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed RNN model is done with respect to SD method and other literatures. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed RNN approach in forecasting short-term electricity prices, different criteria are used. Mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of reasonably small values were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. Error variance, one of the important performance criteria, is also calculated in order to measure robustness of the proposed RNN model. The numerical results obtained through the simulation to forecast next 24 and 72 h electricity prices show that the forecasts generated by the proposed RNN model are significantly accurate and efficient, which confirm that the proposed algorithm performs well for shortterm price forecasting.

"Vahidinasab V., Jadid S.",Bayesian neural network model to predict day-ahead electricity prices,2010,15,"Market participants in the new competitive electricity markets find price forecasting so valuable in developing their bidding strategies. In this paper, the Bayesian neural network (BNN) approach is proposed for day-ahead prediction of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the pool based energy markets, in which to select the optimum inputs of the BNN, the correlation coefficient technique is used. LMP has a volatile and time dependent behavior. Hence, prediction of such a complex signal is a challenging task requiring a qualified forecasting tool, which not only fits well to the training data, but also can predict the stochastic behavior of unseen part of the signal. The proposed Bayesian approach to predict day-ahead electricity prices presents noteworthy advantages over the classical neural networks (NN) methods which include the avoidance of network overfitting, an indication of the degree of uncertainty in the predictions, automatic selection of an appropriate scale for network weights and, accordingly, selection of the optimal forecasting model. Examining the proposed forecast strategy on the different periods of the Pennsylvania- New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can provide more accurate results than the other price forecasting techniques, such as, ARIMA time series, wavelet-ARIMA, classical NN, and also a similar day method.

Combining the Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) and Orthogonal Experimental Design (OED), an Enhanced Radial Basis Function Network (ERBFN) has been proposed for the solving process. The Locational Marginal Price (LMP), system load, transmission flow and temperature of the PJM system were collected and the data clusters were embedded in the Excel Database according to the year, season, workday and weekend. With the OED applied to learning rates in the ERBFN, the forecasting error can be reduced during the training process to improve both accuracy and reliability. This would mean that even the ""spikes"" could be tracked closely.

In this context, this paper proposes the use of Data-Mining techniques to predict the short-term electricity price in the Brazilian market. In Brazil, the market model adopted has unique characteristics with a centralized form of dispatch due to the predominance of hydro generation. To apply the proposed prediction model, all features of the Brazilian electricity market are considered, such as the transmission restrictions among geo-electrical regions and the price dependency with storage energy in reservoirs. In the proposed prediction model, the electricity price is the dependent variable and the monthly time series data sets from the Brazilian system (such as power load, stored energy and thermal generation) are the independent variables. First, clustering of the data samples is performed to group similar behavior of the attributes. After that, a decision tree algorithm is applied to extract if-then rules from database. The rules obtained allow the identification of attributes that most influence the short-term electricity price. Results show that the proposed model can be an attractive tool to all electricity market players to forecast the short-term electricity price and mitigate the risks in purchasing power. © 2009 IEEE.",Clustering; Data-mining; Decision trees; Short-term electricity price forecasting,Brazilian electricity markets; Brazilian system; Clustering; Clustering data; Data sample; Decision-tree algorithm; Dependent variables; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Energy markets; Hydro generation; If-then rules; Independent variables; Market model; Power load; Power markets; Prediction model; Purchasing power; Storage energy; Stored energy; Thermal generation; Time-series data; Cluster analysis; Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Mathematical models; Profitability; Time series; Electric generators,5,1,1,1
"Lei M., Feng Z.",A novel grey model to short-term electricity price forecasting for NordPool power market,2009,2,"In order to improve the forecasting precision of traditional grey model for Short-term price in competitive electricity market, a novel grey model is presented in this paper based on period-decoupled price sequence. According to the interval time of market cleaning, the historical price data are divided into 24 sequences or 48 sequences. In the proposed grey model, two kinds of price sequences, called the main sequence (MS) and the reference sequence (RS), are defined. The correlation coefficient between price sequences of adjacent time intervals is analyzed, which is more than 0.9522 obtained from the Nordpool data in 2007. Therefore, it is determined that the MS is composed of prediction-period price data, and the RS is composed of hour-before-period price data. Furthermore, considering the limitation of the least square method (LSM) used in the traditional grey model for identification the developing coefficient a and the grey input b, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is adopted instead of LSM. Thus the PSOGM (1,2) forecasting model to short-term price is founded. The historical data from the Nordpool power market is used for computing, and the numerical results demonstrate that the MAPE of PSOGM (1,2) model for short-term price rolling prediction is 5.0626% and 7.5491% for continuous forecasting, raising 3%~20% compared with traditional grey model. ©2009 IEEE.",Electrcity price forecasting; Grey model; Particle swarm optimization; Power market,Competitive electricity markets; Correlation coefficient; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting models; Forecasting precision; Grey Model; Historical data; Interval time; Least square methods; Numerical results; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Power markets; Price forecasting; Time interval; Commerce; Costs; Cybernetics; Electric load forecasting; Least squares approximations; Rapid solidification; Particle swarm optimization (PSO),4,1,1,1

"Amjady N., Keynia F.",Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by a new feature selection algorithm and cascaded neural network technique,2009,43,"With the introduction of restructuring into the electric power industry, the price of electricity has become the focus of all activities in the power market. Electricity price forecast is key information for electricity market managers and participants. However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its non-linear, non-stationary, and time variant behavior. In spite of performed research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this paper, a new forecast strategy is proposed for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets. Our forecast strategy is composed of a new two stage feature selection technique and cascaded neural networks. The proposed feature selection technique comprises modified Relief algorithm for the first stage and correlation analysis for the second stage. The modified Relief algorithm selects candidate inputs with maximum relevancy with the target variable. Then among the selected candidates, the correlation analysis eliminates redundant inputs. Selected features by the two stage feature selection technique are used for the forecast engine, which is composed of 24 consecutive forecasters. Each of these 24 forecasters is a neural network allocated to predict the price of 1 h of the next day. The whole proposed forecast strategy is examined on the Spanish and Australia's National Electricity Markets Management Company (NEMMCO) and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Mandal P., Srivastava A.K., Negnevitsky M.",Improving performance of NN based electricity price forecasting using sensitivity analysis,2009,3,"This paper focuses on sensitivity analysis of neural network (NN) parameters in order to improve the performance of NN based short-term electricity price forecasting. Sensitivity analysis of NN parameters include back-propagation learning set (BP-set), learning rate (η), momentum (α) and NN learning days (dNN). Presented work is an extended version of previous work done by authors to integrate NN and similar days (SD) method for predicting day-ahead electricity prices. Similar days refer to similar price days, i.e., price data obtained from historical days. Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of similar price days. Similar days method adopts the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. The similar days parameters, i.e., time framework of similar days (d = 45 days) and number of selected similar price days (N = 5) are kept constant for all the simulated cases. Forecasting performance is carried out by choosing a day from each season of the year 2006 randomly, and for which, the NN parameters for the base case are considered as BP-set = 500, η = 0.8, α = 0.1 and dNN = 45 days. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the value of BP-set (500, 1000, 1500); η (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2), α (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and dNN (15, 30, 45 and 60 days). During the sensitivity analysis, the most favorable value of BP-set is first identified followed by that of η and α, and based on which the best value of dNN is determined. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the best value of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained when BP-set = 500, η = 0.8, α = 0.1 and dNN = 60 days for winter season, whereas for spring, summer and autumn, these values are 500, 0.6, 0.1 and 45 days, respectively.

For pricing of these contracts an important fact concerns the non-storability of electricity. In this case, according to economic theory, forward prices are related to the expected spot prices which are built on fundamental market expectations. In the following article the crucial impact parameters of forward electricity prices and the relationship between forward and future spot prices will be assessed by an empirical analysis of electricity prices at the European Energy Exchange and the Nord Pool Power Exchange. In fact, price formation in the considered markets is influenced by historic spot market prices yielding a biased forecasting power of long-term contracts.

"Amjady N., Keynia F.",Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by mutual information technique and cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm,2009,186,"In a competitive electricity market, price forecasts are important for market participants. However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variant behavior. In spite of much research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this paper, a combination of a feature selection technique and cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA) is proposed for this purpose. The feature selection method is an improved version of the mutual information (MI) technique. The CNEA is composed of cascaded forecasters where each forecaster consists of a neural network (NN) and an evolutionary algorithm (EA). An iterative search procedure is also incorporated in our solution strategy to fine-tune the adjustable parameters of both the MI technique and CNEA. The price forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated by means of real data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) and Spanish electricity markets. The method is also compared with some of the most recent price forecast techniques. © 2009 IEEE.",Cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA); Iterative search procedure; Mutual information (MI); Price forecast,Algorithms; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Marketing; Neural networks; Adjustable parameters; Cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA); Competitive electricity markets; Complex signals; Day-ahead prices; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Feature selection methods; Feature selections; Iterative search procedure; Market participants; Mutual information (MI); Neural-network; New jerseys; Non linearities; Non-stationarity; Price forecast; Solution strategies; Time variants; Evolutionary algorithms,5,2,1,1
"Amjady N., Hemmati M.",Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by a hybrid intelligent system,2009,59,"Price forecasting is so valuable for both producers and consumers in the new competitive electric power markets. In this paper, a new hybrid intelligent system (HIS) is proposed for day-ahead prediction of market clearing price (MCP) in the pool-based markets. MCP has a volatile and time-dependent behavior owning many outliers. Prediction of such a complex signal is a challenging task requiring a qualified forecast tool, which not only fits well to the training data, but also can predict the stochastic behavior of the unseen part of the signal. The proposed hybrid system is composed of a real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA), cross-validation, repetitive training, and archiving techniques combined in the framework of a neural network (NN). The proposed RCGA with enhanced stochastic search capability is used for training of the NN while the cross-validation, repetitive training and archiving techniques enhances generalization capability of it. The proposed forecast strategy is examined on the different periods of the Spanish electricity market. It is shown that the method can provide more accurate results than the other price forecasting techniques such as ARIMA time series, wavelet-ARIMA, fuzzy neural network (FNN), and generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) methods.

However, the DEPF with satisfactory precision is difficult to be gained because of the violent volatility of electricity price caused by many factors. In this study, a multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks model is constructed for the DEPF in spot market of Nord Pool which is one of the most successful electrical power markets in the world. The major influencing factors are chosen by statistical methods called auto correlation function (ACF) and cross correlation function (CCF), and the standard error back-propagation algorithm is improved by using self-adaptive learning rate and self-adaptive momentum coefficient algorithm to make the training process more efficient both in global optimization and time saving.

"Aggarwal S.K., Saini L.M., Kumar A.",Price forecasting using wavelet transform and LSE based mixed model in Australian electricity market,2008,18,"Purpose - Price forecasting is essential for risk management in deregulated electricity markets. The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid technique using wavelet transform (WT) and multiple linear regression (MLR) to forecast price profile in electricity markets. Design/methodology/approach - Price series is highly volatile and non-stationary in nature. In this work, initially complete price series has been decomposed into separate 48 half-hourly series and then these series have been categorized into different segments for price forecasting. For some segments, WT based MLR has been applied and for the other segments, simple MLR model has been applied. The model is general in nature and has been implemented for one day-ahead price forecasting in National Electricity Market (NEM) of Australia. Participants can use the technique practically, since it predicts price well before submission of bids. Findings - Forecasting performance of the proposed WT and MLR based mixed model has been compared with the three other models, an analytical model, a MLR model and an artificial neural network (ANN) based model. The proposed model was found to be better. Performance evaluation for different wavelets was performed, and it has been observed that for improving forecasting accuracy using WT, Daubechies wavelet of order two gives the best performance. Originality/value - Forecasting accuracy improvement of an established technique by incorporating time domain and wavelet domain variables of the same time series into one set has been implemented in this work. The paper also attempts to explain how non-stationarity can be removed from a non-stationary time series by applying WT after appropriate statistical investigation. Moreover, real time electricity markets are highly unpredictable and yet under investigated.

Confirming the system marginal price is the lever and core content of electricity market. At present, how to predict the system marginal price efficiently is one of the focus problems in the research of electricity market application. In the electricity market, system marginal price is not a parameter that varies according to normal rules. It not only has relations to load curve, available generation capacity, bidding mode, system and unit of the generation companies, but also is in reference to price of commodities, inflation and so on. As we can not use mathematic mode to express the diversity and randomicity of factors which reflects electricity price, it is difficult to predict electricity price accurately. In recent years, as the chaotic theory develops, especially speaking, applying chaotic theory to load forecasting offers a new tool to study the stochastic evolution of electricity price. Furthermore, people reveal the regularity that the evolution of both electricity price time series and load time series indicates the chaotic nature, which hiding in these time series themselves. It offers foundation for predicting electricity price by using phase space reconstruction. This paper analyzes the basic character of the system marginal price time series in greater depth.

And the estimation credence of conditional variance function is improved by continually modifying the estimation value of conditional standard deviation as input variance. On the research of day-ahead time series fluctuation characteristics of power price in California in 2000, the time series of Humb node is modeled and forecasted. And the test results show that the model proposed in this paper can better reflect time series volatility clustering characteristics of power price, and it can improve forecasting effect of peak power price by using nonparametric estimation theory. © 2008 DRPT.",Conditional heteroscedasticity estimation; Conditional standard deviation; Conditional variance model; Electricity market; Iterative method; Nonparametric estimation; NP-GARCH model; Power price forecasting; Time series; Volatility,Ahead-time; California; Conditional heteroscedasticity estimation; Conditional standard deviation; Conditional variance; Conditional variance model; Electricity market; Estimation theory; Estimation value; GARCH models; Heteroscedasticity; Input variance; International conferences; Iterative estimation; Iterative method; Non-parametric; Non-parametric estimations; Nonparametric estimation; NP-GARCH model; Peak powers; Power price forecasting; Power pricing; Power technologies; Standard deviation; Test results; Time series; Volatility; Volatility clustering; Deregulation; Estimation; Forecasting; Industrial economics; Iterative methods; Modal analysis; Standards; Statistics; Technology; Time series analysis; Electric load forecasting,4,1,1,1

An adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) is proposed in this paper for short-term price forecasting (STPF) in the electricity markets. A commonly used Mexican hat wavelet has been chosen as the activation function for hidden-layer neurons of feed-forward neural network (FFNN). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, day-ahead prediction of market clearing price (MCP) of Spain market, which is a duopoly market with a dominant player, and locational marginal price (LMP) forecasting in PJM electricity market, are considered.

This will complicate short-term load forecasting and challenge the existing forecasting methods that are applied to a fixed-price environment. In regard to the influence of real-time electricity prices on short-term load, a model to forecast short-term load is established by combining the radial basis function (RBF) neural network with the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The model first makes use of the nonlinear approaching capacity of the RBF network to forecast the load on the prediction day with no account of the factor of electricity price, and then, based on the recent changes of the real-time price, it uses the ANFIS system to adjust the results of load forecasting obtained by RBF network. This system integration will improve forecasting accuracy and overcome the defects of the RBF network. As shown in this paper by the results of an example of factual forecasting, the model presented can work effectively. © 2008 IEEE.",Adaptive neural fuzzy inference system; Power system; Radial basis function neural network; Real-time price; Short-term load forecasting,Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Image classification; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Adaptive neural fuzzy inference system; Electric energies; Electricity markets; Electricity pricing; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting methods; Load forecasting; Power system; Radial basis function neural network; Radial basis function neural networks; RBF networks; RBF neural network; Real-time price; Short-term load forecasting; System integration; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1
"Vahidinasab V., Jadid S., Kazemi A.",Day-ahead price forecasting in restructured power systems using artificial neural networks,2008,97,"Over the past 15 years most electricity supply companies around the world have been restructured from monopoly utilities to deregulated competitive electricity markets. Market participants in the restructured electricity markets find short-term electricity price forecasting (STPF) crucial in formulating their risk management strategies. They need to know future electricity prices as their profitability depends on them. This research project classifies and compares different techniques of electricity price forecasting in the literature and selects artificial neural networks (ANN) as a suitable method for price forecasting. To perform this task, market knowledge should be used to optimize the selection of input data for an electricity price forecasting tool. Then sensitivity analysis is used in this research to aid in the selection of the optimum inputs of the ANN and fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm is used for daily load pattern clustering. Finally, ANN with a modified Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning algorithm are implemented for forecasting prices in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market.

"Boogert A., Dupont D.",When supply meets demand: The case of hourly spot electricity prices,2008,44,We use a supply-demand framework to model the hourly day-ahead price of electricity (the spot price) based on publicly available information. With the model we can forecast the level and probability of a spike in the spot price defined as the spot price above a certain threshold. Several European countries have recently started publishing day-ahead forecasts of the available supply.

"Arciniegas A.I., Arciniegas Rueda I.E.",Forecasting short-term power prices in the Ontario Electricity Market (OEM) with a fuzzy logic based inference system,2008,36,"The Ontario Electricity Market (OEM), which opened in May 2002, is relatively new and is still under change. In addition, the bidding strategies of the participants are such that the relationships between price and fundamentals are non-linear and dynamic. The lack of market maturity and high complexity hinders the use of traditional statistical methodologies (e.g., regression analysis) for price forecasting. Therefore, a flexible model is needed to achieve good forecasting in OEM. This paper uses a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system in forecasting the one-day-ahead real-time peak price of the OEM. The forecasting results of TSK are compared with those obtained by traditional statistical and neural network based forecasting. The comparison suggests that TSK has considerable value in forecasting one-day-ahead peak price in OEM. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Pino R., Parreno J., Gomez A., Priore P.",Forecasting next-day price of electricity in the Spanish energy market using artificial neural networks,2008,92,"In this paper, next-day hourly forecasts are calculated for the energy price in the electricity production market of Spain. The methodology used to achieve these forecasts is based on artificial neural networks, which have been used successfully in recent years in many forecasting applications. The days to be forecast include working days as well as weekends and holidays, due to the fact that energy price has different behaviours depending on the kind of day to be forecast. Besides, energy price time series are usually composed of too many data, which could be a problem if we are looking for a short period of time to reach an adequate forecast. In this paper, a training method for artificial neural nets is proposed, which is based on making a previous selection for the multilayer perceptron (MLP) training samples, using an ART-type neural network. The MLP is then trained and finally used to calculate forecasts. These forecasts are compared to those obtained from the well-known Box-Jenkins ARIMA forecasting method. Results show that neural nets perform better than ARIMA models, especially for weekends and holidays. Both methodologies calculate more accurate forecasts-in terms of mean absolute percentage error-for working days that for weekends and holidays. Agents involved in the electricity production market, who may need fast forecasts for the price of electricity, would benefit from the results of this study. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Zhou Y., Kato M.",Spot prices modeling for JEPX and its applications,2007,0,"All analyses of energy management start with spot prices modeling. Modeling spot prices is becoming a challenging issue under the recent power market deregulation. Generally, there are two approaches for analyzing spot prices. One is cost-based analysis, which focuses on the behavior of time-of-day marginal cost of individual generation companies and power demand. Another is market-based analysis, which mainly studies the causes of price fluctuations and the correlation of prices. This analysis usually uses stochastic approach. However, both of these approaches have weaknesses. For instance, cost-based models are typically not concerned with market data, while market-based approaches are usually not concerned with detailed generation stack production cost. In the present state of affairs, 9 electric utilities in Japan have upper hand power as a seller side in JEPX transaction substantially. Therefore, the compound generation marginal costs, especially the compound time-of-day marginal costs of 9 electric utilities, become major factors in the spot pricing mechanism in JEPX. Based on these facts, the fluctuation mechanism of electricity spot prices in JEPX depends on the supply side to a large extent. So modeling spot prices of JEPX, which consider power demand and supply structures, especially with a focus on the compound marginal generation costs in the 9 electric utilities, will work better than solely using the market model such as stochastic models, or only using the cost-based model such as traditional electric load dispatching (ELD) stack cost calculation. This paper addresses the challenge of building spot prices modeling for JEPX in the following ways: First, we propose a modified hybrid model, which can take not only cost-based issue but also market-based issue into consideration, and, at the same time, decompose the marginal cost function into an expected value division and an indeterminate division. Next, in order to represent the relationship with marginal cost and load, we apply a HILL function, which can well fit the feature of 9 utilities' compound marginal cost, and also propose a method to estimate corresponding parameters. Finally, in order to verify the model, we forecast the spot prices by using this model and compare the result with the actual JEPX data. Forecast errors are relatively small (RMS = 4.6%), which shows that the model fits well the spot pricing mechanism. The results show that the model proposed in this paper can redeem some weaknesses of the cost-based model and the market-based model, and fit the spot pricing mechanism more comprehensively. Our model will be useful in ask/bid-strategies and risk management in power trading.",Electricity market; HILL function; Hybrid model; Marginal cost; Spot price,Electricity market; Hill function; Hybrid model; Marginal costs; Spot price; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric utilities; Energy management; Risk management; Cost benefit analysis,1,1,1,1
"Ofuji K., Kanemoto S.",Price forecasting of Japan electric power exchange using time-varying AR model,2007,5,"In this article, we built a state space model to analyze the price time series in Japan Electric Power Exchange(JEPX) spot market. In building the model, we aimed to achieve the following two goals that the model was able to a) forecast prices with reasonable accuracy, and b) understand the underlying market dynamics by decomposing the price time series into a reasonable set of contributing factors. To capture the time-variability of the contributing factors to price, self-AR(autoregressive) process was introduced to allow continuous change in the magnitude of influence from each explanatory variable. To estimate the model, Kalman Filter algorithm was applied for stepwise recursive estimation. After optimizing the model under the maximum likelihood method(MLM) coupled with minimum AIC(Akaike Information Criteria) conditions, the model was able to decompose the 15:00-15:30 JEPX spot electricity strip price into a couple of the most contributing factors with significant time-dependencies.

"Mandal P., Senjyu T., Yona A., Park J.-W., Srivastava A.K.",Sensitivity analysis of similar days parameters for predicting short-term electricity price,2007,9,"This paper describes an identification of the best similar days parameters for artificial neural network (ANN) based short-term price forecasting. The work presented in this paper is an extended version of our previous works where we proposed the price prediction technique by using ANN, which is based on similar days method. According to similar days method, we select similar price days corresponding to forecast day based on Euclidean norm. The focus of the present paper is mainly on sensitivity analysis of similar days parameter while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the PJM electricity market. We simulated three cases by: (i) selecting two similar days parameters (load at t and price at t); (ii) selecting three similar days parameters (load at t, price at t and price at t - 1), and (iii) selecting five similar days parameters (load at t, load at t - 1, load at t + 1, price at t and price at t - 1). The next-24h price forecasts obtained from ANN based on similar days method confirm that the performance of the ANN model is better when five similar days parameters are selected, i.e., the accuracy of the method is enhanced by the addition of load at t - 1 and t + 1. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, and historical price factors are well discussed. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of reasonably small values were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination of (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. © 2007 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Electricity price forecasting; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Power market; Similar days,Backpropagation; Correlation methods; Error analysis; Forecasting; Neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; ANN modeling; Artificial neural network; Correlation co-efficient; Electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity pricing; Euclidean norms; Load factors; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Mean absolute percentage error; Mean-square errors; Power market; Price factors; Price forecasting; Price prediction; Similar days; Time factors; Electric load forecasting,"4, 5",1,1,1

"Karsaz A., Khaloozadeh H.",Medium term horizon market clearing price and load forecasting with an improved dual unscented Kalman filter,2007,3,"The deregulation of electric power supply industries has raised many challenging problems. One of the most important ones is forecasting the Market Clearing Price (MCP) of electricity. Decisions on various issues, such as to buy or sell electricity and to offer a transaction to the market, require accurate knowledge of the MCP. Another problem, which has also been an important issue of the traditional power systems, is load forecasting for both short and long terms. The extended kalman filter has been widely adopted for state estimation of nonlinear systems, machine learning applications and neural network training. In the EKF, the state distribution is approximated by the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. Therefore this can introduce large errors in the load and price forecasting as two Chaotic, nonstationary and nonlinear time-series. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF), in contrast, achieves third-order accuracy, by using a minimal set of MCP and load sigma points. In this paper an improved dual unscented Kalman filter (DUKF), which estimate state and parameter simultaneously has been applied to the real New England power market. The numerical stability and more accurate predictions of our method is comparable to the EKF, and traditional neural network training methods. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the DUKF is the same order as that of the EKE.

Virtually all of these methods are based on using statistical patterns, which are perceived between the yearly load and system marginal price (SMP) histories of the system to predict the forecasted year's power demand and SMP. The SMP forecasting is a very important element in an electricity market for the optimal biddings of market participants as well as for market stabilization of regulatory bodies.

Specifically, the proposed approach begins with the premise that the electricity price for a given year can be given a structure which can then be related to the structure of the reference year, in such a way that a transformation can be found from the reference year's structure to the forecasting year's structure. The transformation depends upon how parameters, which influenced the SMP but can not be measured, move from the reference year to the forecasting year. © 2006 IEEE.",,Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Market participants; Optimal bidding; Power demands; Regulatory bodies; Statistical pattern; System marginal price; Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Forecasting; Network architecture; Neural networks; Power transmission; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1

This paper adopts artificial neural network (ANN) model based on similar days methodology in order to forecast weekly electricity prices in the PJM market. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, extensive analysis is conducted using data from the PJM Interconnection. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, and historical price factors are discussed. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed ANN model with that of forecasts obtained from similar days approach is discussed. The forecasting error is the major concern for forecaster; a lower error indicates a better result. Accumulative error depends on forecasting period (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). It will increase for a longer time forecasts. In this paper, the test results obtained by using the proposed ANN provide reliable forecast for weekly price forecasting as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values obtained for the first and last week of February 2006 are 7.66% and 8.88%, respectively. Similarly, MAPE for the second week of January 2006 is obtained as 12.92%. Forecast mean square error (FMSE) and MAPE results obtained through the simulation show that the proposed ANN model is capable of forecasting locational marginal price (LMP) in the PJM market efficiently. © 2006 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Competitive power market; Price forecasting; Similar days,Backpropagation; Costs; Forecasting; Marketing; Neural networks; Statistical tests; Accumulative errors; Ann models; Artificial neural network; Competitive electricity markets; Competitive power market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting errors; Forecasting performances; Load factors; Locational Marginal prices; Mean absolute percentage errors; Mean squares; Model-based; PJM interconnections; Price factors; Price forecasting; Price risks; Similar days; Similar days approaches; Test results; Time factors; Electric load forecasting,5,2,1,1

"Benaouda D., Murtagh F.",Hybrid wavelet model for electricity pool-price forecasting in a deregulated electricity market,2006,6,"Electricity supply industry is in the process of deregulation in many countries including Australia. The purpose of deregulation is to give consumers free choices of their electricity supply. Thus, accurate electricity pool price forecasting can provide a set of vital predicted information that helps generation, transmission and retailer participating companies to bid strategically into a deregulated electricity market in order to maximize their profits. In this article, we propose a wavelet multiscale decomposition based autoregressive approach for the prediction of one-hour ahead and one-day ahead pool price based on historical electricity pool price and predicted electricity load data. This approach is based on a multiple resolution decomposition of the signal using the non-decimated or redundant Haar à trous wavelet transform whose advantage is taking into account the asymmetric nature of the time-varying data. There is an additional computational advantage in that there is no need to re-compute the wavelet transform (wavelet coefficients) of the full signal if the electricity pool price data (time series) is regularly updated. We assess results produced by this multiscale autoregressive (MAR) method, in both linear and non-linear variants, with single resolution autoregressive (AR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. Experimental results are based on the New South Wales (Australia) electricity load and pool price data that is provided by the National Electricity Market Management Company (NEMMCO). © 2006 IEEE.",Autoregression; Multi-layer perceptron; Resolution scale; Time-series; Wavelet transform,Energy policy; Marketing; Multilayer neural networks; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Wavelet transforms; Autoregression; Electricity markets; Hybrid wavelet models; Resolution scales; Electric load forecasting,"4, 5",1,1,1

In this paper the problem of modeling market clearing price forecasting in deregulated markets is studied.

"Zareipour H., Cañzares C.A., Bhattacharya K., Thomson J.",Application of public-domain market information to forecast Ontario's wholesale electricity prices,2006,111,"This paper evaluates the usefulness of publicly available electricity market information in forecasting the hourly Ontario energy price (HOEP). In order to do so, relevant data from Ontario and its neighboring electricity markets, namely, New York, New England, and PJM electricity markets, are investigated, and a final set of explanatory variable candidates that are available before real-time are selected. Multivariate transfer function and dynamic regression models are employed to relate HOEP behavior to the selected explanatory variable candidates. Univariate ARIMA models are also developed for the HOEP. The HOEP models are developed on the basis of two forecasting horizons, i.e., 3 h and 24 h, and forecasting performance of the multivariate models is compared with that of the univariate models. The outcomes show that the market information publicly available before real-time can be used to improve HOEP forecast accuracy to some extent; however, unusually high or low prices remain unpredictable, and hence, the available data cannot lead to significantly more accurate forecasts. Nevertheless, the generated forecasts in this paper are significantly more accurate than currently available HOEP forecasts. To analyze the relatively low accuracy of the HOEP forecasts, comparisons are made with respect to ARIMA models developed for locational marginal prices (LMPs) of Ontario's three neighboring markets, and price volatility analyses are presented. © 2006 IEEE.",Electricity markets; Price forecasting; Time series models; Volatility analysis,Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Marketing; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Transfer functions; Electricity markets; Price forecasting; Volatility analysis; Electric power systems,4,1,1,1

An approach to predict the market behaviors is to use the historical prices, loads and other required information to forecast the future prices and loads. This paper introduces an approach for several hour ahead (1-6 h) electricity price and load forecasting using an artificial intelligence method, such as a neural network model, which uses publicly available data from the NEMMCO web site to forecast electricity prices and loads for the Victorian electricity market. An approach of selection of similar days is proposed according to which the load and price curves are forecasted by using the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. A Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of the similar days. Two different ANN models, one for one to six hour ahead load forecasting and another for one to six hour ahead price forecasting have been proposed. The MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) results show a clear increasing trend with the increase in hour ahead load and price forecasting. The sample average of MAPEs for one hour ahead price forecasts is 9.75%. This figure increases to only 20.03% for six hour ahead predictions. Similarly, the one to six hour ahead load forecast errors (MAPE) range from 0.56% to 1.30% only.

Generators, distributors and qualified clients have some uncertainties about the future evolution of electricity markets. In consequence, feasibility studies of new generation plants, design of new systems and energy management optimization are frequently postponed. The ability of forecasting energy prices, for instance the electricity prices, would be highly appreciated in order to improve the profitability of utility investments. The development of new simulation techniques, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), has provided a good tool to forecast time series. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the Neural Network (NN) approach can be used to forecast short term hourly electricity pool prices (for the next day and two or three days after). The NN architecture and design for prices forecasting are described in this paper. The results are tested with extensive data sets, and good agreement is found between actual data and NN results.

Then the ARIMA approach is extended to include error correction for improving accuracy of price forecasting. Moreover, the confidence interval of the forecasted prices is estimated assuming the residual errors are in gaussian or uniform distribution. Hourly MCP forecasting of the Californian Power Market is used as a computer example, and the comparison with conventional ARIMA approach is given.

Due to its attractive properties of learning convergence and speed, many practical areas have widely put it into use including power system marginal price forecasting area. The method of neural network is good at its learning capability but lack of clear internal knowledge expression. The beginning of study is limited to random initial conditions, which may lead to low convergence speed and even local extremum. Necessary initial experience and knowledge cannot be fully made use of. While fuzzy logic method is good at approximate and qualitative knowledge expression but lack of learning capability.

Deregulation of the electric power industry worldwide raises many challenging issues. Under this environment there will be new tasks to be solved. In the traditional and also new structure of the power industry, accurate short and long term load forecasting have been crucial to the efficient and economic operation of the system. However in the environment of a deregulated power market, various decisions require accurate knowledge of future spot prices for electricity.

MCP prediction, however, is difficult, since MCP is a nonstationary process. Effective prediction, in principle, can be achieved by neural networks using extended Kalman filter (EKF) as an integrated adaptive learning and CI estimation method.

"Lee J.-K., Park J.-B., Shin J.-R., Lee K.Y.",A system marginal price forecasing method based on an artificial neural network using time and day information,2005,1,"This paper presents a forecasting technique of the short-term system marginal price (SMP) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The SMP forecasting is a very important element in an electricity market for the optimal biddings of market participants as well as for market stabilization of regulatory bodies. Input data are organized in two different approaches, time-axis and day-axis approaches, and the resulting patterns are used to train the ANN. Performances of the two approaches are compared and the better estimate is selected by a composition rule to forecast the SMP. By combining the two approaches, the proposed composition technique reflects the characteristics of hourly, daily and seasonal variations, as well as the condition of sudden changes in the spot market, and thus improves the accuracy of forecasting. The proposed method is applied to the historical real-world data from the Korea Power Exchange (KPX) to verify the effectiveness of the technique.

Compared with load, the price of electricity is volatile, but it is not regarded as random; therefore it is possible to identify patterns based on historical data and load forecast. Market participants only have access to the public information provided by the Independent System Operator (ISO); this limits the ability of the market participants to produce accurate price forecast. An accurate estimation of the electricity price helps the market participants to determine their bidding strategy; making necessary the development of accurate price forecasting methods. In this paper the authors propose a statistical method for price forecasting considering the historical price and loads of the California power market; matching the load and price profiles of the forecasting day with historical data of previous similar days. Simulation results show that the forecasted price is closely related with the price historical data and the load of the forecasting day. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by comparing the actual price with the forecasted price and calculating the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The simulation results show the accuracy of the method and its practical application.

Good LMP forecasting will help market participants make effective decisions when preparing offers and bids and making bilateral contracts. LMP forecasting, however, is difficult since LMPs are closely affected by complicated market behaviors and depend heavily on transmission congestions. This paper presents a neural network-based method for forecasting zonal LMPs by using the Decoupled Extend Kalman Filter (DEKF) with UD factorization and sequential updating. Congestion components are emphasized by forecasting differences between zonal LMPs and hub LMPs, and the hub LMPs themselves are forecasted by their logarithm to better reflect market behaviors. A method is also developed to capture system transmission outages. To overcome the unavailability of zonal loads, a method is developed to predict zonal loads based on the total load. Two neural networks are developed to forecast real-time LMPs before and after the day-ahead market is cleared. Testing results with data from the PJM and New England markets show that the method is computationally efficient and provides accurate LMP predictions and confidence intervals.

The distributions from the first class have closed form formulas for probability densities, probability distribution functions, and quantile functions, while the distributions from the second class may have extremely unbalanced tails. Having rich tail behaviors, both classes allow realistic modeling of the power price dynamics. The appealing features of this approach are that it can effectively model the heavy tail behavior of electricity prices caused by jumps and stochastic volatility and that the resulting distributions are easy to simulate.

Different neural networks, however, may capture different features in data, and result in different inferences and predictions. Furthermore, network performance may not be constant as input features change. Without information on prediction quality of individual networks, it is difficult to appropriately combine them in a committee machine. To overcome the difficulty, insightful information called the prediction confidence is introduced and an associated method of determining adaptive weighting coefficients is developed in this paper. The key idea is that the confidence of a prediction is measured by the inverse of a prediction variance. Adaptive weighting coefficients are then derived to depend on past network performance and the confidence of current predictions. Therefore, a committee machine can properly determine coefficients according to past performance and prediction confidence of networks. The effectiveness of a new combination method is illustrated by power market cleaning price prediction.",Committee machines; Market clearing price forecasting; Neural networks,Approximation theory; Data acquisition; Forecasting; Probability; Problem solving; Committee machines; Price forecasting; Neural networks,5,1,1,2
"Zhang L., Luh P.B.",Power market clearing price prediction and confidence interval estimation with fast neural network learning,2002,13,"Market clearing prices (MCPs) play an important role in a deregulated power market, and good MCP prediction and interval estimation will help utilities and independent power producers submit effective bids with low risks in this uncertain market. Since MCP is a non-stationary process, an adaptive algorithm with fast convergence is important. A common method for MCP prediction is neural networks, and multilayer perceptron networks (MLP) is one of the widely used networks. Back propagation (BP) is a popular learning method for MLP, while BP suffers from slow convergence. This paper presents an integrated learning and interval estimation algorithm for MCP prediction. In the extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework, confidence interval is a natural by-product of EKF, and is integrated with learning process to improve learning results in addition to fast convergence. Since Kalman filter (KF) is a minimum variance estimator for linear system, EKF framework helps to provide a smaller confidence interval, which is preferred in risk management. Testing results on New England MCP prediction show the integrated learning and confidence interval algorithm provides better prediction than BP algorithm and the confidence interval is smaller with reasonable coverage than a Bayesian inference-based interval estimation method.",Confidence interval; Extended Kalman filter; Market clearing price; Neural networks; Power systems; Prediction methods; Risk management,Algorithms; Deregulation; Finance; Kalman filtering; Learning systems; Neural networks; Risk management; Price prediction; Electric power systems,5,1,1,2

"Ni E., Luh P.B.",Forecasting power market clearing price and its discrete PDF using a Bayesian-based classification method,2001,49,"Neural network methods have been successfully used for various applications. In time series prediction problems, the regression models such as multiple layer perceptron (MLP) and the radial basis function network (RBF) are usually applied. However, they cannot predict the probability density function (PDF) that is critical for some applications. When there is noise or corrupt data in the process, these regression models could be misled, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. In this paper, a classification method combined with a simple regression model is presented to predict the discrete PDF of power market clearing prices, which is critical for many decision-makings such as optimizing bidding strategies, and is very difficult to predict because of high market uncertainties. Our basic idea is to form a number of classes by discretizing the variable to be predicted, and thus converts the time series prediction problem into a pattern classification problem. The classes are clustered based on historical data, and the input statistics (e.g., input mean and covariance matrix, etc.) corresponding to each class are obtained via clustering. Given a new input, these classes are sorted according to the posterior probabilities calculated by using the Bayes’ formula. The prediction is then generated by using an auto-regression method (AR) for the classes with high posterior probabilities. The classes are then updated after the actual output is available. The method developed can be seen as an RBF with variable structure. The posterior probabilities can be viewed as an approximation of the discrete PDF, providing valuable information for decision-makes and for what if analysis. The developed method has been used to predict the on-peak and off-peak average MCPs in the New England market.

Almost until the end of last century, electricity supply was considered a public service and any price forecasting which was undertaken tended to be over the longer term, concerning future fuel prices and technical improvements. Nowadays, short-term forecasts have become increasingly important since the rise of the competitive electricity markets. In this new competitive framework, short-term price forecasting is required by producers and consumers to derive their bidding strategies to the electricity market. Accurate forecasting tools are essential for producers to maximize their profits, avowing profit losses over the misjudgement of future price movements, and for consumers to maximize their utilities.

Rather than forecasting the value, market participants are sometimes more interested in forecasting the prediction interval of the electricity price. Forecasting the prediction interval is essential for estimating the uncertainty involved in the price and thus is highly useful for making generation bidding strategies and investment decisions. In this paper, a novel data mining-based approach is proposed to achieve two major objectives: 1) to accurately forecast the value of the electricity price series, which is widely accepted as a nonlinear time series; 2) to accurately estimate the prediction interval of the electricity price series. In the proposed approach, support vector machine (SVM) is employed to forecast the value of the price. To forecast the prediction interval, we construct a statistical model by introducing a heteroscedastic variance equation for the SVM.

Accurate and reliable electricity market price forecasting is essential to facilitate various decision making activities of market participants in the future smart grid environment. However, due to the nonstationarities involved in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather difficult to accurately predict MCPs in advance. The challenge is getting intensified as more and more renewable energy and other new technologies emerged in smart grids. Therefore transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts can be of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts, thus effectively supporting the decision making activities against uncertainties and risks ahead.

In this article a new and very easy method to compute accurate forecasts for electricity prices using mixed models is proposed. The main idea is to develop an efficient tool for one-step-ahead forecasting in the future, combining several prediction methods for which forecasting performance has been checked and compared for a span of several years. Also as a novelty, the 24 hourly time series has been modelled separately, instead of the complete time series of the prices. This allows one to take advantage of the homogeneity of these 24 time series. The purpose of this paper is to select the model that leads to smaller prediction errors and to obtain the appropriate length of time to use for forecasting. These results have been obtained by means of a computational experiment. A mixed model which combines the advantages of the two new models discussed is proposed.

"Lu X., Dong Z.Y., Li X.",Electricity market price spike forecast with data mining techniques,2005,88.0,"Electricity market price forecast is a changeling yet very important task for electricity market managers and participants. Due to the complexity and uncertainties in the power grid, electricity prices are highly volatile and normally carry with spikes, which may be tens or even hundreds of times higher than the normal price. Such electricity spikes are very difficult to be predicted. So far, most of the research on electricity price forecast is based on the normal range electricity prices. This paper proposes a data mining based electricity price forecast framework, which can predict the normal price as well as the price spikes. The normal price can be predicted by a previously proposed wavelet and neural network based forecast model, while the spikes are forecasted based on a data mining approach. This paper focuses on the spike prediction and explores the reasons for price spikes based on the measurement of a proposed composite supply-demand balance index (SDI) and relative demand index (RDI). These indices are able to reflect the relationship among electricity demand, electricity supply and electricity reserve capacity. The proposed model is based on a mining database including market clearing price, trading hour, electricity demand, electricity supply and reserve. Bayesian classification and similarity searching techniques are used to mine the database to find out the internal relationships between electricity price spikes and these proposed.

"Fan S., Mao C., Chen L.",Next-day electricity-price forecasting using a hybrid network,2007,84.0,"The paper proposes a novel method of forecasting short-term electricity price based on a two-stage hybrid network of self-organised map (SOM) and support-vector machine (SVM). In the first stage, a SOM network is applied to cluster the input-data set into several subsets in an unsupervised manner. Then, a group of SVMs is used to fit the training data of each subset in the second stage in a supervised way. With the trained network, one can predict straightforwardly the next-day hourly electricity prices.

Price forecasting is also the most important management goal for market participants since it forms the basis of maximizing profits. This study investigates the performance of a novel neural network technique called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in the price forecasting problem. Keeping in view the risk associated with electricity markets with highly volatile prices, relying on a single technique is not so profitable. Therefore ELM has been coupled with the Wavelet technique to develop a hybrid model termed as WELM (wavelet based ELM) to improve the forecasting accuracy as well as reliability. In this way, the unique features of each tool are combined to capture different patterns in the data. The robustness of the model is further enhanced using the ensembling technique. Performances of the proposed models are evaluated by using data from Ontario, PJM, New York and Italian Electricity markets.

"Hong Y.-Y., Lee C.-F.",A neuro-fuzzy price forecasting approach in deregulated electricity markets,2005,80.0,"Bidding competition is a main transaction approach in a deregulated market. Locational marginal prices (LMPs) resulting from bidding competition signal electricity values at a node or in an area. The LMP reveals important information for market participants to develop their bidding strategies.

This paper presents a method using fuzzy reasoning and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting LMPs. The fuzzy rules are used to perform the linguistic reasoning about the contingencies. The reasoning results serve as a part of inputs to the RNNs for forecasting the LMPs. The historical LMPs in the PJM market are used to test the proposed method.

Among many properties, a successful prediction tool should be able to capture long-term dependencies in market's historical data. A nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (NARX) has proven to enjoy a superior performance to capture such dependencies than other learning machines. However, it is not examined for electricity price forecasting so far. In this paper, we have employed a NARX network for forecasting electricity prices. Our prediction model is then compared with two currently used methods, namely the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and wavelet neural network. All the models are built on the reconstructed state space of market's historical data, which either improves the results or decreases the complexity of learning algorithms. Here, we also criticize the one-step ahead forecasts for electricity price that may suffer a one-term delay and we explain why the mean square error criterion does not guarantee a functional prediction result in this case.

The context is the UK market, after the reforms introduced in March 2001, analysed with an original set of price drivers reflecting economic, technical, strategic, risk, behavioural and market design effects. Models are estimated separately as daily time-series of the 48 half-hourly trading periods. All coefficients exhibit substantial intra-day variation, relating to the heterogeneity of operating plants and market design aspects. This reveals a market responding to economic fundamentals and plant operating properties, with learning and emergent financial characteristics, as well as some strategic manipulation of capacity, most effectively exercised by the more flexible plants. Using regime-switching parameters, the effects of capacity margin and inter-day capacity adjustment are elucidated, suggesting rent-seeking behaviour, despite the relatively low prices at the time.

Chaâbane N.,A hybrid ARFIMA and neural network model for electricity price prediction,2014,58.0,"In the framework of competitive electricity market, prices forecasting has become a real challenge for all market participants. However, forecasting is a rather complex task since electricity prices involve many features comparably with those in financial markets. Electricity markets are more unpredictable than other commodities referred to as extreme volatile. Therefore, the choice of the forecasting model has become even more important.

In this paper, a novel hybrid methodology for electricity price forecasting is introduced and applied on a set of real-world historical data taken from the New England area. The proposed approach is implemented in two steps. In the first step, a set of relevance vector machines (RVMs) is adopted, where each RVM is used for individual ahead-of-time price prediction. In the second step, individual predictions are aggregated to formulate a linear regression ensemble, whose coefficients are obtained as the solution of a single objective optimization problem. Thus, an optimal solution to the problem is found by employing the micro-genetic algorithm and the optimized ensemble is employed for computing the final price forecast. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with performance of autoregressive-moving-average and naïve forecasting methods, as well as to that taken from each individual RVM. Results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid methodology over the other tested methods with regard to mean absolute error for electricity signal pricing forecasting. © 2015 IEEE.",Autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA); electricity price forecasting; genetic algorithms; price-directed smart grid; relevance vector machines (RVMs),Costs; Deregulation; Electric load forecasting; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Scheduling; Autoregressive moving average; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Individual prediction; Micro genetic algorithm; Real-time forecasting; Relevance Vector Machine; Single objective optimization problems; Smart power grids,5,1,1,1

"Christensen T.M., Hurn A.S., Lindsay K.A.",Forecasting spikes in electricity prices,2012,50.0,"In many electricity markets, retailers purchase electricity at an unregulated spot price and sell to consumers at a heavily regulated price. Consequently, the occurrence of spikes in the spot electricity price represents a major source of risk for retailers, and the forecasting of these price spikes is important for effective risk management. Traditional approaches to modelling electricity prices have aimed to predict the trajectory of spot prices. In contrast, this paper focuses on the prediction of price spikes. The time series of price spikes is treated as a discrete-time point process, and a nonlinear variant of the autoregressive conditional hazard model is used to model this process. The model is estimated using half-hourly data from the Australian electricity market for the period 1 March 2001 to 30 June 2007. One-step-ahead forecasts of the probability of a price spike are then generated for each half hour in the forecast period, 1 July 2007 to 30 September 2007. The forecasting performance of the model is then evaluated against a benchmark that is consistent with the assumptions of commonly-used electricity pricing models. © 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.",Autoregressive conditional duration; Autoregressive conditional hazard; Electricity futures; Electricity prices; Price spikes,,4,1,1,1

"Amjady N., Daraeepour A.",Mixed price and load forecasting of electricity markets by a new iterative prediction method,2009,48.0,"Load and price forecasting are the two key issues for the participants of current electricity markets. However, load and price of electricity markets have complex characteristics such as nonlinearity, non-stationarity and multiple seasonality, to name a few (usually, more volatility is seen in the behavior of electricity price signal). For these reasons, much research has been devoted to load and price forecast, especially in the recent years. However, previous research works in the area separately predict load and price signals. In this paper, a mixed model for load and price forecasting is presented, which can consider interactions of these two forecast processes. The mixed model is based on an iterative neural network based prediction technique. It is shown that the proposed model can present lower forecast errors for both load and price compared with the previous separate frameworks. Another advantage of the mixed model is that all required forecast features (from load or price) are predicted within the model without assuming known values for these features. So, the proposed model can better be adapted to real conditions of an electricity market. The forecast accuracy of the proposed mixed method is evaluated by means of real data from the New York and Spanish electricity markets. The method is also compared with some of the most recent load and price forecast techniques. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Haldrup N., Nielsen F.S., Nielsen M.Ø.",A vector autoregressive model for electricity prices subject to long memory and regime switching,2010,43.0,"A regime dependent VAR model is suggested that allows long memory (fractional integration) in each of the observed regime states as well as the possibility of fractional cointegration. The model is motivated by the dynamics of electricity prices where the transmission of power is subject to occasional congestion periods. For a system of bilateral prices non-congestion means that electricity prices are identical whereas congestion makes prices depart. Hence, the joint price dynamics implies switching between a univariate price process under non-congestion and a bivariate price process under congestion. At the same time, it is an empirical regularity that electricity prices tend to show a high degree of long memory, and thus that prices may be fractionally cointegrated.Analysis of Nord Pool data shows that even though the prices are identical under non-congestion, the prices are not, in general, fractionally cointegrated in the congestion state. Hence, in most cases price convergence is a property following from regime switching rather than a conventional error correction mechanism. Finally, the suggested model is shown to deliver forecasts that are more precise compared to competing models. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Cointegration; Electricity prices; Fractional integration; Long memory; Regime switching,Cointegration; Electricity prices; Fractional integration; Long memories; Regime switching; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Lakes; Switching; Costs; cointegration analysis; commodity price; electricity; empirical analysis; error correction; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; price dynamics; vector autoregression,4,1,1,1

The main idea is to develop a new training or identification stage in a nonlinear chaotic dynamic based predictor. In the training stage five optimal parameters for a chaotic based predictor are searched through an optimization model based on evolutionary strategy. The objective function of the optimization model is the mismatch minimization between the multi-step-ahead forecasting of predictor and observed data such as it is done in identification problems. The first contribution of this paper is that the proposed approach is capable of capturing the complex dynamic of demand and price time series considered resulting in a more accuracy forecasting. The second contribution is that the proposed approach run on-line manner, i.e. the optimal set of parameters and prediction is executed automatically which can be used to prediction in real-time, it is an advantage in comparison with other models, where the choice of their input parameters are carried out off-line, following qualitative/experience-based recipes. A case study of load and price forecasting is presented using data from New England, Alberta, and Spain. A comparison with other methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and artificial neural network (ANN) is shown.

"Ruibal C.M., Mazumdar M.",Forecasting the mean and the variance of electricity prices in deregulated markets,2008,42.0,"A fundamental bid-based stochastic model is presented to predict electricity hourly prices and average price in a given period. The model captures both the economic and physical aspects of the pricing process, considering two sources of uncertainty: availability of the units and demand. This work is based on three oligopoly models-Bertrand, Cournot, and supply function equilibrium (SFE) due to Rudkevich, Duckworth, and Rosen-and obtains closed form expressions for expected value and variance of electricity hourly prices and average price. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the number of firms, anticipated peak demand, and price elasticity of demand. The results show that as the number of firms in the market decreases, the expected values of prices increase by a significant amount. Variances for the Cournot model also increase, but the variances for the SFE model decrease, taking even smaller values than Bertrand's. Thus, if the Rudkevich model is an accurate representation of the electricity market, the results show that an introduction of competition may decrease the expected value of prices but the variances may actually increase. Finally, using a refinement of the model, it has been demonstrated that an accurate temperature forecast can reduce significantly the prediction error of the electricity prices. © 2007 IEEE.","Average prices; Bertrand model; Cournot model; Deregulated electricity markets; Edgeworth expansion; Electricity price variance; Electricity prices; Hourly prices; Method of cumulants; Rudkevich, Duckworth, and Rosen's formula; Stochastic load; Supply function equilibrium",Competition; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electric load management; Marketing; Stochastic models; Uncertainty analysis; Bertrand model; Cournot model; Edgeworth expansion; Electricity price variance; Method of cumulants; Supply function equilibrium; Electric rates,1,1,1,1

"Amjady N., Keynia F.",Electricity market price spike analysis by a hybrid data model and feature selection technique,2010,40.0,"In a competitive electricity market, energy price forecasting is an important activity for both suppliers and consumers. For this reason, many techniques have been proposed to predict electricity market prices in the recent years. However, electricity price is a complex volatile signal owning many spikes. Most of electricity price forecast techniques focus on the normal price prediction, while price spike forecast is a different and more complex prediction process. Price spike forecasting has two main aspects: prediction of price spike occurrence and value. In this paper, a novel technique for price spike occurrence prediction is presented composed of a new hybrid data model, a novel feature selection technique and an efficient forecast engine. The hybrid data model includes both wavelet and time domain variables as well as calendar indicators, comprising a large candidate input set. The set is refined by the proposed feature selection technique evaluating both relevancy and redundancy of the candidate inputs. The forecast engine is a probabilistic neural network, which are fed by the selected candidate inputs of the feature selection technique and predict price spike occurrence.

"Pedregal D.J., Trapero J.R.",Electricity prices forecasting by automatic dynamic harmonic regression models,2007,39.0,"The changes experienced by electricity markets in recent years have created the necessity for more accurate forecast tools of electricity prices, both for producers and consumers. Many methodologies have been applied to this aim, but in the view of the authors, state space models are not yet fully exploited. The present paper proposes a univariate dynamic harmonic regression model set up in a state space framework for forecasting prices in these markets. The advantages of the approach are threefold. Firstly, a fast automatic identification and estimation procedure is proposed based on the frequency domain. Secondly, the recursive algorithms applied offer adaptive predictions that compare favourably with respect to other techniques. Finally, since the method is based on unobserved components models, explicit information about trend, seasonal and irregular behaviours of the series can be extracted. This information is of great value to the electricity companies' managers in order to improve their strategies, i.e. it provides management innovations.

"Mandal P., Srivastava A.K., Park J.-W.",An effort to optimize similar days parameters for ANN-based electricity price forecasting,2009,38.0,"This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of similar days (SD) parameters to increase the accuracy of artificial neural network (ANN) and SD-based short-term price forecasting. Work presented in this paper is an extended version of previous works done by the authors to integrate ANN and SD method for predicting electricity price. The focus here is on sensitivity analysis of SD parameters while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) (regional transmission organization in northeast America) electricity market. Several cases are simulated by choosing (a) two, (b) three, (c) four, and (d) five SD parameters to calculate the norm. In addition, sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the time framework of SD (d = 15, 30, 45, 60) and the number of selected similar price days (N = 5, 10). From sensitivity analysis, it is identified that the optimized mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained using case-c with d = 30 and N = 10. MAPE of reasonably small value, along with forecast mean square error and mean absolute error of around 2$/MWh and 1$/MWh, is obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. Numerical results show that forecasts generated by the developed ANN model based on the optimized case are accurate and efficient. © 2009 IEEE.","Artificial neural network (ANN); Electricity market; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Price forecasting, sensitivity analysis; Similar days (SD) parameters","Artificial neural network (ANN); Electricity market; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Price forecasting, sensitivity analysis; Similar days (SD) parameters; Backpropagation; Commerce; Costs; Diffusers (optical); Electric load forecasting; Electric network analysis; Electricity; Neural networks; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis",5,1,1,1

Hence, this paper proposes a new hybrid evolutionary-adaptive methodology for electricity prices forecasting in the short-term, i.e., between 24 and 168 h ahead, successfully combining mutual information, wavelet transform, evolutionary particle swarm optimization, and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. In order to determine the accuracy, competence and proficiency of the proposed methodology, results from real-world case studies using real data are presented, together with a thorough comparison considering the results obtained with previously reported forecasting tools. Not only is the accuracy an important factor, but also the computational burden is relevant in a comparative study. The results show that it is possible to reduce the uncertainty associated with electricity market prices prediction without using any exogenous data, just the historical values, thus requiring just a few seconds of computation time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Driven by profit maximizing decisions taken by various agents, these markets belong to the class of financial systems. However presence of intermittent spikes and complex dynamic nonlinearities in electricity price time series render the prediction task extremely challenging. The approximation ability of Recurrent Neural Networks to map dynamic functions together with sharp jumping attribute of coupled excitable systems allows close approximation of spiky time series.

"Zhao J.H., Dong Z.Y., Li X.",Electricity market price spike forecasting and decision making,2007,33.0,"Forecasting price spikes is a timely issue for the deregulated electricity market. Traditional price forecasting techniques show poor performance in handling price spikes, which usually follow a pattern different from the prices under normal market conditions. Therefore, novel approaches are required to forecast both the occurrences and values of spikes. In this paper a comprehensive study is conducted to investigate the performance of several data mining techniques for spike forecasting. Another major contribution of this paper is that a novel approach is proposed to integrate the spike forecasting process with decision-making, and to provide a comprehensive risk management tool against spikes. This approach is based on the Naïve Bayesian Classifier. The benefits/costs of possible decisions are considered in the spike forecasting process to achieve the maximum benefits from the decisions against price spikes. We give a comprehensive theoretical proof of the proposed Bayesian classifier with benefit maximisation (BCBM) approach, which empirically demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving promising experiment results on real market price datasets. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2007.",,Cost benefit analysis; Data mining; Data structures; Decision making; Optimization; Risk management; Bayesian Classifiers; Risk management tools; Spike forecasting processes; Electric utilities,5,2,1,1

Thus, there is a need of providing methodology that is able to deal with the most important features of electricity price series, which are well known for presenting not only structure in conditional mean but also time-varying conditional variances. In this work we propose a new model, which allows to extract conditionally heteroskedastic common factors from the vector of electricity prices. These common factors are jointly estimated as well as their relationship with the original vector of series, and the dynamics affecting both their conditional mean and variance. The estimation of the model is carried out under the state-space formulation. The new model proposed is applied to extract seasonal common dynamic factors as well as common volatility factors for electricity prices and the estimation results are used to forecast electricity prices and their volatilities in the Spanish zone of the Iberian Market.

It provides useful information for the market players and the regulators, in both short and long run. Different approaches have been proposed and implemented. A new dynamic approach for forecasting the market price of electricity in the short term is proposed. The price dates are first clustered according to different types of daily profiles and then, given a proper function representing the trend in price, the set of unknown parameters are identified based on the zeroing of a Lyapunov function. The forecast can be dynamically updated with the latest data available. Higher weight can be attributed to this data in determining the future prices. The proposed approach is validated with reference to real systems in the form of the Italian, New England and New York electricity markets.

"Bello A., Reneses J., Muñoz A., Delgadillo A.",Probabilistic forecasting of hourly electricity prices in the medium-term using spatial interpolation techniques,2016,21.0,"In the context of competitive electricity markets, medium-term price forecasting is essential for market stakeholders. However, very little research has been conducted in this field, in contrast to short-term price forecasting. Previous studies of electricity price forecasting have tackled the problem of medium-term prediction using fundamental market equilibrium models with daily data, or at most, averages of groups of hours. Similarly, the limitations of point forecasts are recognized widely, but the literature dealing with probabilistic forecasts is sparse. In this study, a novel methodology for the medium-term hourly forecasting of electricity prices is proposed. This methodology is unique in the sense that it also attempts to perform punctual and probabilistic hourly predictions simultaneously. The approach consists of a nested combination of several modeling stages. The first stage consists of generating multiple scenarios of uncertain variables. In a second stage, a market equilibrium model that incorporates Monte Carlo simulation and a new definition of load levels is executed for a reduced combination of the scenarios generated. The application of spatial interpolation techniques allows us to estimate numerous feasible realizations of electricity prices from only several hundred executions of the fundamental market equilibrium model without any loss of accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is verified in a real-size electricity system that is characterized by complex price dynamics: the Spanish market. © 2015 International Institute of Forecasters",Electricity prices; Medium-term hourly prediction; Medium-term probabilistic forecasting; Monte Carlo simulation,,1,2,1,"1, 2"

The daily electricity price time series is analyzed in two layers - normal behavior and spiky behavior. Two different data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle trend and seasonality in the time series. An ARMA-based model is used to catch the linear relationship between the normal range price series and the explanatory variable, a GARCH model is used to unveil the heteroscedastic character of residuals and a neural network is applied to present the nonlinear impact of the explanatory variable on electricity prices and improve predictions based on time series techniques. The probability of a price spike occurrence and the value of a price spike are produced by a Gaussian Mixture model and K-nearest neighboring model, respectively. Forecasts of normal range prices and price spikes are generated to form an overall price forecast up to one week ahead. The results show that hybridization of the normal range price and price spikes forecasts may provide comprehensive and valuable information for electricity market participants. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ARMA; electricity price forecast; GARCH; Gaussian mixture; K-nearest neighboring; model; neural network; price spikes,Commerce; Electric load forecasting; Forecasting; Models; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Time series; ARMA; Electricity prices; GARCH; Gaussian mixtures; Price spike; Costs,4,"1, 2",1,1

Kristiansen T.,A time series spot price forecast model for the Nord Pool market,2014,16.0,We present three relatively simple spot price forecast models for the Nord Pool market based on historic spot and futures prices including data for inflow and reservoir levels. The models achieve a relatively accurate forecast of the weekly spot prices. The composite regression model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of around 7.5% and under-forecasts the actual spot price by some 1.4 NOK/MW h in the sample period. Out of sample testing achieves a MAPE of around 7.4% including a match of the actual spot price. A myopic model using the previous week's spot price as a predictor for the next week's spot price achieves a MAPE of 7.5% and under-forecasts the actual spot price by some 0.9 EUR/MW h. A futures model using the futures price for next week as a predictor for next week's spot price achieves a MAPE of 5.3% and over-forecast the actual spot price by some 4.3 EUR/MW h. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Xiao C., Dong Z., Xu Y., Meng K., Zhou X., Zhang X.",Rational and self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine for electricity price forecast,2016,14.0,"Electricity price forecast is of great importance to electricity market participants. Moreover, various prediction approaches based on extreme learning machine (ELM) have been identified as effective on normal decision space. Especially, evolutionary extreme learning machine (E-ELM) may obtain better solution quality. However, in high dimensional space, E-ELM is time-consuming because it is difficult to converge into optimal region when just relied on stochastic searching approaches. In addition, due to the complex functional relationship is often complicated, the objective function of E-ELM seems hard to be mined directly for obtaining useful mathematical information to guide the optimum exploring. This paper proposes a new differential evolution (DE)-like algorithm to enhance E-ELM for more accurate and reliable prediction of electricity price. The approximation model for producing DE-like trail vector is the key mechanism, which may use simpler mathematical mapping to replace the original yet complicated functional relationship within a small region. Thus, the evolutionary procedure frequently guided by rational searching directions may make the E-ELM more robust and faster than supported only by those stochastic methods. Several benchmarks are applied to test the performances of the proposed algorithm and the experimental results have shown that the new method can improve the performance of E-ELM. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Approximation model; Differential evolution; Electricity price prediction; Extreme learning machine,Benchmarking; Costs; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Functions; Knowledge acquisition; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Approximation model; Differential Evolution; Electricity prices; Extreme learning machine; Functional relationship; High dimensional spaces; Mathematical information; Stochastic searching; Learning systems,5,1,1,1

However, while spot and future markets are currently rather liquid, option trading is still limited. One of the potential reasons for this is that the electricity spot price process remains a puzzle to researchers and practitioners.

Thereby, we use different mean reversion rates for ‘normal’ and ‘extreme’ (spike) periods. Furthermore, all model parameters can easily be estimated using historical data. Consequently, we argue that this model does not only extend the academic literature on electricity spot price modeling, but is also suitable for practical purposes, such as an underlying price model for option pricing. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",electricity; Lévy processes; mean reversion; spikes; stochastic volatility,,"3, 4",1,1,1

"Chen D., Bunn D.",The forecasting performance of a finite mixture regime-switching model for daily electricity prices,2014,10.0,"Forecasting prices in electricity markets is a crucial activity for both risk management and asset optimization. Intra-day power prices have a fine structure and are driven by an interaction of fundamental, behavioural and stochastic factors. Furthermore, there are reasons to expect the functional forms of price formation to be nonlinear in these factors and therefore specifying forecasting models that perform well out-of-sample is methodologically challenging. Markov regime switching has been widely advocated to capture some aspects of the nonlinearity, but it may suffer from overfitting and unobservability in the underlying states. In this paper we compare several extensions and alternative regime-switching formulations, including logistic specifications of the underlying states, logistic smooth transition and finite mixture regression.

To achieve this goal, conventional time series econometrics analysis and one alternative technique based on artificial intelligence algorithms have been implemented. We use autoregressive-moving-average models (ARMAX) and non-linear autoregressive neural networks (NARX). After estimating a hybrid model that combines ARMAX and ARNX models, including exogenous inputs, we forecasted an electricity price time series in a horizon of 12 months ahead (May, 2017). Results show that NARX model’s performance is not significantly better than ARMAX’s. After applying a Diebold-Mariano test for forecasting accuracy, the null hypothesis is not rejected. This suggests no significant difference in predictive accuracy between the competing methodologies. © 2018, Econjournals.

"Li L., Mendoza-Arriaga R., Mo Z., Mitchell D.",Modelling electricity prices: a time change approach,2016,5.0,"To capture mean reversion and sharp seasonal spikes observed in electricity prices, this paper develops a new stochastic model for electricity spot prices by time changing the Jump Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (JCIR) process with a random clock that is a composite of a Gamma subordinator and a deterministic clock with seasonal activity rate. The time-changed JCIR process is a time-inhomogeneous Markov semimartingale which can be either a jump-diffusion or a pure-jump process, and it has a mean-reverting jump component that leads to mean reversion in the prices in addition to the smooth mean-reversion force. Furthermore, the characteristics of the time-changed JCIR process are seasonal, allowing spikes to occur in a seasonal pattern. The Laplace transform of the time-changed JCIR process can be efficiently computed by Gauss–Laguerre quadrature. This allows us to recover its transition density through efficient Laplace inversion and to calibrate our model using maximum likelihood estimation. To price electricity derivatives, we introduce a class of measure changes that transforms one time-changed JCIR process into another time-changed JCIR process. We derive a closed-form formula for the futures price and obtain the Laplace transform of futures option price in terms of the Laplace transform of the time-changed JCIR process, which can then be efficiently inverted to yield the option price. By fitting our model to two major electricity markets in the US, we show that it is able to capture both the trajectorial and the statistical properties of electricity prices. Comparison with a popular jump-diffusion model is also provided. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Electricity futures and futures options; Electricity spot prices; Laplace transform; Mean-reversion; Seasonality; Spikes; Stochastic time change,,3,"1, 2",1,1

"Wang J., Xiao L., Shi J.",The combination forecasting of electricity price based on price spikes processing: A case study in South Australia,2014,4.0,"Electricity price forecasting holds very important position in the electricity market. Inaccurate price forecasting may cause energy waste and management chaos in the electricity market. However, electricity price forecasting has always been regarded as one of the largest challenges in the electricity market because it shows high volatility, which makes electricity price forecasting difficult. This paper proposes the use of artificial intelligence optimization combination forecasting models based on preprocessing data, called ""chaos particles optimization (CPSO) weight-determined combination models."" These models allow for the weight of the combined model to take values of [-1,1]. In the proposed models, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is used to identify outliers, and the outliers are replaced by a new data-produced linear interpolation function. The proposed CPSO weight-determined combination models are then used to forecast the projected future electricity price. In this case study, the electricity price data of South Australia are simulated.

"Yang Y., Dong Y., Chen Y., Li C.","Intelligent optimized combined model based on GARCH and SVM for forecasting electricity price of New South Wales, Australia",2014,4.0,"Daily electricity price forecasting plays an essential role in electrical power system operation and planning. The accuracy of forecasting electricity price can ensure that consumers minimize their electricity costs and make producers maximize their profits and avoid volatility. However, the fluctuation of electricity price depends on other commodities and there is a very complicated randomization in its evolution process. Therefore, in recent years, although large number of forecasting methods have been proposed and researched in this domain, it is very difficult to forecast electricity price with only one traditional model for different behaviors of electricity price. In this paper, we propose an optimized combined forecasting model by ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) based on the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and support vector machine (SVM) to improve the forecasting accuracy. First, both GARCH model and SVM are developed to forecast short-term electricity price of New South Wales in Australia. Then, ACO algorithm is applied to determine the weight coefficients.

Although a number of forecasting methods have been proposed to solve the shortterm and long-term electricity load forecast, pool-price forecasting is a relatively new research area. In this article, we propose an autoregressive approach, based on a wavelet multiscale decomposition, for the prediction of one-hour ahead load and pool price based respectively on historical electricity load, and pool-price data. This approach is based on a multiple resolution decomposition of the signal using the redundant Haar à trous wavelet transform whose advantage is taking into account the asymmetric nature of the time-varying data. There is an additional computational advantage in that there is no need to re-compute the wavelet transform (wavelet coefficients) of the full signal if the electricity and pool price data (time series) is regularly updated. We assess results produced by this multiscale autoregressive method, in both linear and nonlinear variants, with single resolution autoregressive, multilayer perceptron, Elman recurrent neural network and the general regression neural network models.

This common market consists of organised markets or power exchanges, and non-organised markets where bilateral over-the-counter trading takes place with or without brokers. Within this scenario, electricity price forecasts have become fundamental to the process of decision-making and strategy development by market participants. The unique characteristics of electricity prices such as non-stationarity, non-linearity and high volatility make this task very difficult. For this reason, instead of a simple time forecast, market participants are more interested in a causal forecast that is essential to estimate the uncertainty involved in the price. This work focuses on modelling the impact of various explanatory variables on the electricity price through a multiple linear regression analysis. The quality of the estimated models obtained validates the use of statistical or causal methods, such as the Multiple Linear Regression Model, as a plausible strategy to achieve causal forecasts of electricity prices in medium and long-term electricity price forecasting.

However, the uncertain, stochastic and fluctuant characteristics of electricity pricees make prediction difficult. With the aim of solving this issue, this investigation proposed a multi-stage intelligent model integrating the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition (B-N-D) model, the least square support vector machine (LSSVM), and a nature-inspired optimization model named the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). Firstly, the B-N-D model was utilized to decompose the hourly electricity price time series into determinacy component, periodic trend, and stochastic item. Secondly, the WOA-LSSVM model was proposed to forecast the future hourly data of three components respectively, of which the optimal parameters of LSSVM were determined by using WOA. Finally, the future hourly electricity price data were computed by multiplying the forecasted data of those terms. To verify the validity of the proposed electricity price prediction model in this paper, five comparison approaches based on the B-N-D approach were selected, which are autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), single LSSVM, LSSVM optimized by the fruit-fly optimization algorithm (FOA), LSSVM optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) models, and WOA-LSSVM without B-N-D. By comparatively analyzing the error criteria values of the above models through testing on the objective data of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) electricity market collected from 11 December 2017 to 18 December 2017, from 15 January 2018 to 22 January 2018, and from 1 February 2018 to 25 February 2018, we conclude that the constructed intelligent model in this paper can greatly enhance the prediction precision of electricity prices. © 2018 by the authors.",Beveridge-Nelson decomposition approach; Electricity price prediction; Least square support vector machine; Multi-stage intelligent model; Whale optimization algorithm,accuracy assessment; algorithm; electricity generation; electricity industry; least squares method; numerical model; optimization; prediction; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; United States; Cetacea,"4, 5",1,1,1

"Burnett J.W., Zhao X.",Spatially Explicit Prediction of Wholesale Electricity Prices,2017,1.0,"Transmission constraints often limit the flow of electricity in a regional transmission network leading to strong interaction effects across different geographically distributed points within the system. In modern wholesale electricity markets, these transmission constraints lead to spatial patterns within the nodal electricity spot prices. This study exploits these spatial patterns to better predict spot prices within a wholesale electricity market. More specifically, we use the latest spatial panel data econometric models to compare within-sample and out-of-sample forecasts against nonspatial panel data models. The spatial panel data approach is explained by demonstrating a simple network optimization model. We find that a dynamic, spatial panel data model provides the best predictions within a forecasting error context. Our results may suggest that the spatial autocorrelation between node prices extends beyond the current market-defined zonal boundaries, which calls into question whether the zonal boundaries accurately reflect the congestion boundaries within the system. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",electricity prices; forecasting; locational marginal pricing; spatial panel data econometrics,autocorrelation; econometrics; electricity supply; error analysis; forecasting method; optimization; panel data; price dynamics; spatial data,1,1,1,1
"Grossi L., Nan F.",Robust self exciting Threshold autoregressive models for electricity prices,2014,1.0,"In this paper we suggest the use of robust GM-SETAR (Self Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive) processes to model and forecast electricity prices observed on deregulated markets. The robustness of the model is achieved by extending to time series the generalized M-type (GM) estimator first introduced for independent multivariate data. As it has been shown in a very recent paper [1], the polynomial weighting function over-performs the classical ordinary least squares method when extreme observations are present. The main advantage of estimating robust SETAR models is the possibility to capture two very well-known stylized facts of electricity prices: nonlinearity produced by changes of regimes and the presence of sudden spikes due to inelasticity of demand. The forecasting performance of the model applied to the Italian electricity market (IPEX) is improved by the introduction of predicted demand as an exogenous regressor. The availability of this regressor is a particular feature of the Italian market. By means of prediction performance indexes and tests, it will be shown that this regressor plays a crucial role and that robust methods improve the overall forecasting performance of the model. © 2014 IEEE.",extreme values; GM estimator; nonlinear models; Terms-Electricity prices,Commerce; Deregulation; Estimation; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Extreme value; Forecasting performance; GM estimator; Non-linear model; Ordinary least squares methods; Prediction performance; Self-Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive models; Terms-Electricity prices; Costs,4,1,1,1

Nishikawa H.,Time series analysis of JEPX spot price with the box-Jenkins method,2007,1.0,"Following the examples of other countries, in April 2005 Japan launched wholesale electric power exchange operations as a primary item of system reform in line with electric liberalization. Only two years have passed since the initiation of these operations. However, in the summer of 2005, the surge in market prices was evident, which suggested that certain measures should be taken to confront potential market risks. Establishing a useful system for forecasting market prices through the modeling of price fluctuations in the wholesale electric market became essential. Currently, various price models are being proposed. Taking both the limited amount of data and the model's purpose into consideration, this study adopted the univariate time series model. We conducted a time series analysis on the open price indexes in the JEPX spot market with the Box-Jenkins method. Since a seven-day cycle can be observed in the data, we adopted the seasonal ARIMA model. In accordance with the procedures of the Box-Jenkins method, we determined the degree of the model's polynomial using the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation of the data and estimated the parameters of the model with the maximum likelihood method. We conducted a forecast on next day JEPX spot market prices with this time series model and examined its validity and utility as a forecasting tool. Price forecasts made with this model require only a small amount of data and will save substantial analysis work. Consequently, this method is expected to be widely used by market participants as the reference data for their bid pricing.",Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX); Market risk; Seasonal ARIMA model; Spot market; Time series analysis,Data acquisition; Electric power transmission; Marketing; Parameter estimation; Polynomial approximation; Time series analysis; Box-Jenkins method; Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX); Market risk; Cost accounting,4,1,1,1

To this end, parallel methods and adaptive regression have been used in the past. But because dependence on the ambient temperature, there was no good result. In this study, linear prediction methods and neural networks and fuzzy logic have been studied and emulated. An optimized fuzzy-wavelet prediction method is proposed to predict the price of electricity. In this method, in order to have a better prediction, the membership functions of the fuzzy regression along with the type of the wavelet transform filter have been optimized using the E.Coli Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm. Then, to better compare this optimal method with other prediction methods including conventional linear prediction and neural network methods, they were analyzed with the same electricity price data. In fact, our fuzzy-wavelet method has a more desirable solution than previous methods. More precisely by choosing a suitable filter and a multiresolution processing method, the maximum error has improved by 13.6%, and the mean squared error has improved about 17.9%. In comparison with the fuzzy prediction method, our proposed method has a higher computational volume due to the use of wavelet transform as well as double use of fuzzy prediction.

Dash S.K.,A hybrid ARMA-Legendre polynomial neural network and evolutionary H-infinity filter for the prediction of electricity market clearing price,2015,,"A hybrid adaptive autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and Legendre polynomial neural network trained by an evolutionary H-infinity filter is presented in this paper for predicting short-Term electricity prices in a deregulated market. The proposed model comprises a linear autoregressive (AR) part and nonlinear moving average (MA) part obtained through the use of Legendre polynomial basis functions. The Legendre polynomial functional block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher dimensional space through basis functions without using any hidden layer like the multilayered perceptron (MLP) network. Instead of using the standard forward-backward (FB-LMS) algorithm for learning the weight parameters of the ARMALEG (hybrid ARMA and Legendre network) a robust H-infinity filter is used which is superior to the widely used extended Kalman filter in terms of handling uncertain noise covariances resulting in fast convergence and tracking. Further to improve the accuracy, the H-infinity filter parameters are optimised using a differential evolution (DE) strategy.

The hourly spot prices of electricity have so far shown evidence of being highly volatile. In this paper, we propose a stochastic model for the spot market price of electricity in which no historical data for the prices are required. Rather than directly modeling the price, we model the underlying stochastic processes of the marginal unit that determines the price of electricity under market competition. The deregulated market of electricity is still evolving and the set of generating units participating in a particular market can be constantly changing. A model that uses historically observed market prices may thus give inaccurate predictions. Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to collect empirical data to obtain an accurate forecast for the spot market price. Our price model represents the market by a power generation system and captures its fundamenta l stochastic characteristics. This model highlights the dependence of the price on temperature fluctuations.
