"Bhagat M., Alamaniotis M., Fevgas A.",Extreme Interval Electricity Price Forecasting of Wholesale Markets Integrating ELM and Fuzzy Inference,2019,,"The electricity wholesale market is inherently volatile in a deregulated market structure where market participants like power generators and retailors drive the price of electricity. Timely forecasting of the wholesale market prices by market participants has become of utmost importance in order to maximize on profits and minimize on risks. This report presents a hybrid method comprised of an extreme learning machine and a fuzzy inference engine to forecast price intervals using historical wholesale price extreme values (price maximum and minimum), historical load, generation and congestion hours, forecasted temperature and power outage data. This hybrid forecasting method has been tested on RTO Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection for the period July 1st, 2018 to February 8th, 2019, and is compared with individual extreme learning machine and the non-linear autoregressive neural network. © 2019 IEEE.",Electricity interval price forecasting; Extreme learning machine; Fuzzy inference; Wholesale electricity markets,Commerce; Deregulation; Digital storage; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Outages; Power markets; Autoregressive neural networks; Deregulated markets; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme learning machine; Hybrid forecasting; Market participants; Price forecasting; Wholesale electricity markets; Fuzzy inference,5,2,1,2
"Serafin T., Uniejewski B., Weron R.",Averaging predictive distributions across calibration windows for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2019,5,"The recent developments in combining point forecasts of day-ahead electricity prices across calibration windows have provided an extremely simple, yet a very efficient tool for improving predictive accuracy. Here, we consider two novel extensions of this concept to probabilistic forecasting: one based on Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) applied to a set of point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows, the other on a technique dubbed Quantile Regression Machine (QRM), which first averages these point predictions, then applies quantile regression to the combined forecast. Once computed, we combine the probabilistic forecasts across calibration windows by averaging probabilities of the corresponding predictive distributions. Our results show that QRM is not only computationally more efficient, but also yields significantly more accurate distributional predictions, as measured by the aggregate pinball score and the test of conditional predictive ability. Moreover, combining probabilistic forecasts brings further significant accuracy gains. c 2019 by the authors.",Autoregression; Average probability forecast; Calibration window; Combining forecasts; Conditional predictive ability; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive distribution,Calibration; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Regression analysis; Autoregression; Combining forecasts; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive abilities; Predictive distributions; Probability forecasts; Power markets,4,2,1,2
"Osório G.J., Lotfi M., Shafie-khah M., Campos V.M.A., Catalão J.P.S.",Hybrid forecasting model for short-term electricity market prices with renewable integration,2018,6,"In recent years, there have been notable commitments and obligations by the electricity sector for more sustainable generation and delivery processes to reduce the environmental footprint. However, there is still a long way to go to achieve necessary sustainability goals while ensuring standards of robustness and the quality of power grids. One of the main challenges hindering this progress are uncertainties and stochasticity associated with the electricity sector and especially renewable generation. In this paradigm shift, forecasting tools are indispensable, and their utilization can significantly improve system operation and minimize costs associated with all related activities. Thus, forecasting tools have an essential key role in all decision-making stages. In this work, a hybrid probabilistic forecasting model (HPFM) was developed for short-term electricity market prices (EMP) combining wavelet transforms (WT), hybrid particle swarm optimization (DEEPSO), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The proposed hybrid probabilistic forecasting model (HPFM) was tested and validated with real data from the Spanish and Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) markets. The proposed model exhibited favorable results and performance in comparison with previously published work considering electricity market prices (EMP) data, which is notable. © 2018 by the authors.",Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Electricity market prices; Forecasting; Monte Carlo simulation; Particle swarm optimization; Probabilistic,decision making; electricity; energy market; environmental impact; forecasting method; fuzzy mathematics; model; Monte Carlo analysis; optimization; probability; simulation; stochasticity; sustainability; uncertainty analysis; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; United States,5,2,1,2
"Ziel F., Steinert R.",Probabilistic mid- and long-term electricity price forecasting,2018,27,"The liberalization of electricity markets and the development of renewable energy sources has led to new challenges for decision makers. These challenges are accompanied by an increasing uncertainty about future electricity price movements. The increasing amount of papers, which aim to model and predict electricity prices for a short period of time provided new opportunities for market participants. However, the electricity price literature seem to be very scarce on the issue of medium- to long-term price forecasting, which is mandatory for investment and political decisions. Our paper closes this gap by introducing a new approach to simulate electricity prices with hourly resolution for several months up to three years. Considering the uncertainty of future events we are able to provide probabilistic forecasts which are able to detect probabilities for price spikes even in the long-run. As market we decided to use the EPEX day-ahead electricity market for Germany and Austria. Our model extends the X-Model which mainly utilizes the sale and purchase curve for electricity day-ahead auctions. By applying our procedure we are able to give probabilities for the due to the EEG practical relevant event of six consecutive hours of negative prices. We find that using the supply and demand curve based model in the long-run yields realistic patterns for the time series of electricity prices and leads to promising results considering common error measures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity prices; Long-term; Negative prices; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energy; Supply and demand,Commerce; Costs; Curve fitting; Decision making; Forecasting; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Electricity prices; Long-term; Negative prices; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energies; Supply and demand; Power markets,4,"2, 3",1,2
"Bello A., Bunn D.W., Reneses J., Munoz A.",Medium-Term Probabilistic Forecasting of Electricity Prices: A Hybrid Approach,2017,22,"This paper provides a focus upon forecasting electricity prices in the medium term (from a few weeks to several months ahead) in which accurate estimates of tail risks, e.g., at the 1%, 5%, 95%, and 99%, are important. Medium term forecasting and risk analysis are important for operational scheduling, fuel purchasing, trading, and profit management. We extend the research on hybrid forecasting methods, which link detailed fundamental price formation models, using optimization techniques and market equilibrium considerations, with econometric recalibration to the time series data. This paper is innovative in its use of quantile regression to undertake the recalibration and provide accurate risk estimates. It is shown that probabilistic outputs from the fundamental model add value over expected value inputs to the quantile regressions and that if the fundamental model is itself well specified to diurnal variation through the inclusion of relevant explanatory variables such as demand or climatic conditions, then it is not necessary to undertake the quantile regressions separately for each hour of the day. A real application of the proposed methodology is successfully tested on the Spanish electric power system, in which the high penetration of intermittent wind generation creates extreme price risks. The hybrid method outperforms the more conventional fundamental model, making particular use of wind generation data in the quantile recalibrations. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Electricity prices; fundamentals; hybrid model; probabilistic forecasting; quantile regression,Commerce; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Scheduling; Electricity prices; fundamentals; Hybrid model; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile regression; Costs,4,2,1,2
"Cheng C., Luo B., Miao S., Wu X.",Mid-term electricity market clearing price forecasting with sparse data: A case in newly-reformed yunnan electricity market,2016,11,"For the power systems, for which few data are available for mid-term electricity market clearing price (MCP) forecasting at the early stage of market reform, a novel grey prediction model (defined as interval GM(0, N) model) is proposed in this paper. Over the traditional GM(0, N) model, three major improvements of the proposed model are: (i) the lower and upper bounds are firstly identified to give an interval estimation of the forecasting value; (ii) a novel whitenization method is then established to determine the definite forecasting value from the forecasting interval; and (iii) the model parameters are identified by an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) instead of the least square method (LSM) for the limitation of LSM. Finally, a newly-reformed electricity market in Yunnan province of China is studied, and input variables are contrapuntally selected. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by observed data. Compared with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, the traditional GM(0, N) model and the artificial neural network (ANN) model, the proposed model gives a better performance and its superiority is further ensured by the use of the modified Diebold-Mariano (MDM) test, suggesting that it is suitable for mid-term electricity MCP forecasting in a data-sparse electricity market. © 2016 by the authors.",Grey prediction model; Market clearing price (MCP); Mid-term; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sparse data,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Linear regression; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); System theory; Artificial neural network models; Grey prediction model; Lower and upper bounds; Market Clearing Price; Market clearing prices; Mid-term; Multiple linear regression models; Sparse data; Power markets,4,2,1,2
"Bello A., Reneses J., Muñoz A.",Medium-term probabilistic forecasting of extremely low prices in electricity markets: Application to the Spanish case,2016,15,"One of the most relevant challenges that have arisen in electricity markets during the last few years is the emergence of extremely low prices. Trying to predict these events is crucial for market agents in a competitive environment. This paper proposes a novel methodology to simultaneously accomplish punctual and probabilistic hourly predictions about the appearance of extremely low electricity prices in a medium-term scope. The proposed approach for making real ex ante forecasts consists of a nested compounding of different forecasting techniques, which incorporate Monte Carlo simulation, combined with spatial interpolation techniques. The procedure is based on the statistical identification of the process key drivers. Logistic regression for rare events, decision trees, multilayer perceptrons and a hybrid approach, which combines a market equilibrium model with logistic regression, are used. Moreover, this paper assesses whether periodic models in which parameters switch according to the day of the week can be even more accurate. The proposed techniques are compared to a Markov regime switching model and several naive methods. The proposed methodology empirically demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving promising results on a real case study based on the Spanish electricity market. This approach can provide valuable information for market agents when they face decision making and risk-management processes. Our findings support the additional benefit of using a hybrid approach for deriving more accurate predictions. © 2016 by the authors.",Electricity markets; Extremely low prices; Hybrid approach; Medium-term electricity price forecasting; Probabilistic forecasting; Spikes,Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Power markets; Regression analysis; Risk management; Electricity price forecasting; Extremely low prices; Hybrid approach; Probabilistic forecasting; Spikes; Decision making,4,2,1,2
"Nowotarski J., Weron R.",Merging quantile regression with forecast averaging to obtain more accurate interval forecasts of Nord Pool spot prices,2014,5,"We evaluate a recently proposed method for constructing prediction intervals, which utilizes the concept of quantile regression (QR) and a pool of point forecasts of different time series models.

"Bello A., Reneses J., Muñoz A., Delgadillo A.",Probabilistic forecasting of hourly electricity prices in the medium-term using spatial interpolation techniques,2016,21.0,"In the context of competitive electricity markets, medium-term price forecasting is essential for market stakeholders. However, very little research has been conducted in this field, in contrast to short-term price forecasting. Previous studies of electricity price forecasting have tackled the problem of medium-term prediction using fundamental market equilibrium models with daily data, or at most, averages of groups of hours. Similarly, the limitations of point forecasts are recognized widely, but the literature dealing with probabilistic forecasts is sparse. In this study, a novel methodology for the medium-term hourly forecasting of electricity prices is proposed. This methodology is unique in the sense that it also attempts to perform punctual and probabilistic hourly predictions simultaneously. The approach consists of a nested combination of several modeling stages. The first stage consists of generating multiple scenarios of uncertain variables. In a second stage, a market equilibrium model that incorporates Monte Carlo simulation and a new definition of load levels is executed for a reduced combination of the scenarios generated. The application of spatial interpolation techniques allows us to estimate numerous feasible realizations of electricity prices from only several hundred executions of the fundamental market equilibrium model without any loss of accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is verified in a real-size electricity system that is characterized by complex price dynamics: the Spanish market. © 2015 International Institute of Forecasters",Electricity prices; Medium-term hourly prediction; Medium-term probabilistic forecasting; Monte Carlo simulation,,1,2,1,"1, 2"
"Azevedo F., Vale Z.A.",Forecasting electricity prices with historical statistical information using neural networks and clustering techniques,2006,19.0,"Factors such as uncertainty associated to fuel prices, energy demand and generation availability, are on the basis of the agents major concerns in electricity markets. Facing that reality, price forecasting has an increasing impact in agents' activity. The success on bidding strategies or on price negotiation for bilateral contracts is directly dependent on the accuracy of the price forecast. However, taking decisions based only on a single forecasted value is not a good practice in risk management. The work presented in this paper makes use of artificial neural networks to find the market price for a given period, with a certain confidence level. Historical information was used to train the neural networks and the number of neural networks used is dependent of the number of clusters found on that data. K-Means clustering method is used to find clusters.

"Yan X., Chowdhury N.A.",Electricity market clearing price forecasting in a deregulated electricity market,2010,15.0,"This paper presents a mid-term electricity market clearing price forecasting technique utilizing neural network approach. Forecasting of mid-term market clearing price is essential for decision making, scheduling and bidding strategy planning purposes. However, forecasting mid-term electricity market clearing price is a very complex non-linear problem. Neural network based approaches can be effective forecasting tools in an environment with high degree of non-linearity and uncertainty. Two new artificial neural networks have been proposed and reported in this paper that can be utilized to forecast mid-term daily peak and mid-term hourly electricity market clearing price. Two situations have been considered; market clearing price forecasting under real deregulated electric market and under deregulated electric market with perfect competition.

"Shrivastava N.A., Panigrahi B.K.",Prediction interval estimations for electricity demands and prices: A multi-objective approach,2015,6.0,"Electricity price and demand forecasting are becoming essential practices for the deregulated market participants such as system operators, generation companies, industries and end use consumers. With a prominent growth in the uncertainty aspect of the energy sources, climatic changes and demand patterns, it is essential to supplement the traditional point forecasts with prediction intervals (PIs) which are an important tool for quantifying the uncertainty of forecasted entities. This study proposes a novel approach for generation of PIs using a differential evolution-based multi-objective approach. The traditional PI generation is framed as a multi-objective problem and a set of Pareto-optimal solutions are generated. The proposed technique is validated using electricity price and demand data from the Ontario electricity market. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique can successfully generate high-quality PIs. © 2015.

"Shrivastava N.A., Khosravi A., Panigrahi B.K.",Prediction interval estimation for electricity price and demand using support vector machines,2014,6.0,"Uncertainty is known to be a concomitant factor of almost all the real world commodities such as oil prices, stock prices, sales and demand of products. As a consequence, forecasting problems are becoming more and more challenging and ridden with uncertainty. Such uncertainties are generally quantified by statistical tools such as prediction intervals (Pis). Pis quantify the uncertainty related to forecasts by estimating the ranges of the targeted quantities. Pis generated by traditional neural network based approaches are limited by high computational burden and impractical assumptions about the distribution of the data. A novel technique for constructing high quality Pis using support vector machines (SVMs) is being proposed in this paper. The proposed technique directly estimates the upper and lower bounds of the PI in a short time and without any assumptions about the data distribution. The SVM parameters are tuned using particle swarm optimization technique by minimization of a modified Pi-based objective function. Electricity price and demand data of the Ontario electricity market is used to validate the performance of the proposed technique. Several case studies for different months indicate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of high quality PI generation and shorter computational times. © 2014 IEEE.",Deregulation; Particle swarm optimization; Prediction interval; Support vector machines; Uncertainty,Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Statistical mechanics; Uncertainty analysis; Computational burden; Network-based approach; Ontario electricity markets; Particle swarm optimization technique; Prediction interval; Support vector machine (SVMs); Uncertainty; Upper and lower bounds; Support vector machines,5,2,1,2
"Qu Z., Gao M., Liu Y., Lv H., Sun J., Li M., Liu W., Cui M.",	Probability Prediction Method of Short-Term Electricity Price Based on Quantile Neural Network Model,2020,,"Aiming at the inaccuracy of short-term electricity price forecasting in competitive power markets, a probabilistic short-term electricity price forecasting method based on the quantile neural network model is proposed. First, a method for selecting electricity price similarity based on comprehensive influencing factors is designed to select the forecast data set with similar characteristics to the forecast date. The similar daily quantile regression algorithm is then combined with the generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network to construct a quantile neural network electricity price model for obtaining the predicted daily electricity price condition quantile. Finally, the kernel density function is used to convert the predicted daily electricity price condition quantile into the predicted probability density curve to realize short-term electricity price probability prediction. The data of the electricity market of the city of Dayton, Ohio in the United States is used as an example. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of short-term electricity price forecasting. © 2020, The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.",	Electricity market; Probability forecasting; Quantile neural network model; Short-term price forecasting,	Electric industry; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Probability density function; Competitive power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price model; Generalized dynamic fuzzy neural networks; Neural network model; Probability density curve; Probability forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Power markets,5,"1,2",1,	2
