"Conejo A.J., Plazas M.A., Espínola R., Molina A.B.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using the wavelet transform and ARIMA models,2005,646.0,"This paper proposes a novel technique to forecast day-ahead electricity prices based on the wavelet transform and ARIMA models. The historical and usually ill-behaved price series is decomposed using the wavelet transform in a set of better-behaved constitutive series. Then, the future values of these constitutive series are forecast using properly fitted ARIMA models. In turn, the ARIMA forecasts allow, through the inverse wavelet transform, reconstructing the future behavior of the price series and therefore to forecast prices.

"Catalão J.P.S., Mariano S.J.P.S., Mendes V.M.F., Ferreira L.A.F.M.",Short-term electricity prices forecasting in a competitive market: A neural network approach,2007,302.0,"This paper proposes a neural network approach for forecasting short-term electricity prices. Almost until the end of last century, electricity supply was considered a public service and any price forecasting which was undertaken tended to be over the longer term, concerning future fuel prices and technical improvements. Nowadays, short-term forecasts have become increasingly important since the rise of the competitive electricity markets. In this new competitive framework, short-term price forecasting is required by producers and consumers to derive their bidding strategies to the electricity market. Accurate forecasting tools are essential for producers to maximize their profits, avowing profit losses over the misjudgement of future price movements, and for consumers to maximize their utilities. A three-layered feedforward neural network, trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, is used for forecasting next-week electricity prices. We evaluate the accuracy of the price forecasting attained with the proposed neural network approach, reporting the results from the electricity markets of mainland Spain and California. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"Yun Z., Quan Z., Caixin S., Shaolan L., Yuming L., Yang S.",RBF neural network and ANFIS-based short-term load forecasting approach in real-time price environment,2008,284.0,"With the appearance of electricity markets, the variation of the price of electricity will influence usage custom of electric energy. This will complicate short-term load forecasting and challenge the existing forecasting methods that are applied to a fixed-price environment. In regard to the influence of real-time electricity prices on short-term load, a model to forecast short-term load is established by combining the radial basis function (RBF) neural network with the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The model first makes use of the nonlinear approaching capacity of the RBF network to forecast the load on the prediction day with no account of the factor of electricity price, and then, based on the recent changes of the real-time price, it uses the ANFIS system to adjust the results of load forecasting obtained by RBF network. This system integration will improve forecasting accuracy and overcome the defects of the RBF network. As shown in this paper by the results of an example of factual forecasting, the model presented can work effectively. © 2008 IEEE.",Adaptive neural fuzzy inference system; Power system; Radial basis function neural network; Real-time price; Short-term load forecasting,Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Image classification; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Adaptive neural fuzzy inference system; Electric energies; Electricity markets; Electricity pricing; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting methods; Load forecasting; Power system; Radial basis function neural network; Radial basis function neural networks; RBF networks; RBF neural network; Real-time price; Short-term load forecasting; System integration; Electric load forecasting,Article

"González A.M., San Roque A.M., García-González J.",Modeling and forecasting electricity prices with input/output hidden Markov models,2005,228.0,"In competitive electricity markets, in addition to the uncertainty of exogenous variables such as energy demand, water inflows, and availability of generation units and fuel costs, participants are faced with the uncertainty of their competitors' behavior. The analysis of electricity price time series reflects a switching nature, related to discrete changes in competitors' strategies, which can be represented by a set of dynamic models sequenced together by a Markov chain. In this paper, an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) is proposed for analyzing and forecasting electricity spot prices. The model provides both good predictions in terms of accuracy as well as dynamic information about the market. In this way, different market states are identified and characterized by their more relevant explanatory variables. Moreover, a conditional probability transition matrix governs the probabilities of remaining in the same state, or changing to another, whenever a new market session is opened. The model has been successfully applied to real clearing prices in the Spanish electricity market. © 2005 IEEE.",Artificial neural networks; Electricity markets; Hidden Markov models; Modeling competitors' behavior; Price forecasting,Costs; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Mathematical models; Matrix algebra; Neural networks; Probability density function; Electricity markets; Hidden Markov models; Price forecasting; Probability transition matrix; Electric industry,Article

An adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) is proposed in this paper for short-term price forecasting (STPF) in the electricity markets. A commonly used Mexican hat wavelet has been chosen as the activation function for hidden-layer neurons of feed-forward neural network (FFNN). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, day-ahead prediction of market clearing price (MCP) of Spain market, which is a duopoly market with a dominant player, and locational marginal price (LMP) forecasting in PJM electricity market, are considered.

"Weron R., Misiorek A.",Forecasting spot electricity prices: A comparison of parametric and semiparametric time series models,2008,191.0,"This empirical paper compares the accuracy of 12 time series methods for short-term (day-ahead) spot price forecasting in auction-type electricity markets. The methods considered include standard autoregression (AR) models and their extensions - spike preprocessed, threshold and semiparametric autoregressions (i.e., AR models with nonparametric innovations) - as well as mean-reverting jump diffusions. The methods are compared using a time series of hourly spot prices and system-wide loads for California, and a series of hourly spot prices and air temperatures for the Nordic market. We find evidence that (i) models with system load as the exogenous variable generally perform better than pure price models, but that this is not necessarily the case when air temperature is considered as the exogenous variable; and (ii) semiparametric models generally lead to better point and interval forecasts than their competitors, and more importantly, they have the potential to perform well under diverse market conditions. © 2008 International Institute of Forecasters.",Autoregressive model; Conditional coverage; Electricity market; Interval forecasts; Nonparametric maximum likelihood; Price forecasts,,Article

"Amjady N., Keynia F.",Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by mutual information technique and cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm,2009,186.0,"In a competitive electricity market, price forecasts are important for market participants. However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variant behavior. In spite of much research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this paper, a combination of a feature selection technique and cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA) is proposed for this purpose. The feature selection method is an improved version of the mutual information (MI) technique. The CNEA is composed of cascaded forecasters where each forecaster consists of a neural network (NN) and an evolutionary algorithm (EA). An iterative search procedure is also incorporated in our solution strategy to fine-tune the adjustable parameters of both the MI technique and CNEA. The price forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated by means of real data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) and Spanish electricity markets. The method is also compared with some of the most recent price forecast techniques. © 2009 IEEE.",Cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA); Iterative search procedure; Mutual information (MI); Price forecast,Algorithms; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Marketing; Neural networks; Adjustable parameters; Cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA); Competitive electricity markets; Complex signals; Day-ahead prices; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Feature selection methods; Feature selections; Iterative search procedure; Market participants; Mutual information (MI); Neural-network; New jerseys; Non linearities; Non-stationarity; Price forecast; Solution strategies; Time variants; Evolutionary algorithms,Article

"Mandal P., Senjyu T., Urasaki N., Funabashi T., Srivastava A.K.",A novel approach to forecast electricity price for PJM using neural network and similar days method,2007,160.0,"Price forecasting in competitive electricity markets is critical for consumers and producers in planning their operations and managing their price risk, and it also plays a key role in the economic optimization of the electric energy industry. This paper explores a technique of artificial neural network (ANN) model based on similar days (SD) method in order to forecast day-ahead electricity price in the PJM market. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, publicly available data acquired from the PJM Interconnection were used for training and testing the ANN. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, and historical price factors, are discussed. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed ANN model with that of forecasts obtained from similar days method is presented. Daily and weekly mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of reasonably small value and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of less than 7$MWh were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination R2 of 0.6744 between load and electricity price.

"Chen X., Dong Z.Y., Meng K., Xu Y., Wong K.P., Ngan H.W.",Electricity price forecasting with extreme learning machine and bootstrapping,2012,157.0,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely applied in electricity price forecasts due to their nonlinear modeling capabilities. However, it is well known that in general, traditional training methods for ANNs such as back-propagation (BP) approach are normally slow and it could be trapped into local optima. In this paper, a fast electricity market price forecast method is proposed based on a recently emerged learning method for single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks, the extreme learning machine (ELM), to overcome these drawbacks. The new approach also has improved price intervals forecast accuracy by incorporating bootstrapping method for uncertainty estimations. Case studies based on chaos time series and Australian National Electricity Market price series show that the proposed method can effectively capture the nonlinearity from the highly volatile price data series with much less computation time compared with other methods.

"Sioshansi R., Short W.",Evaluating the impacts of real-time pricing on the usage of wind generation,2009,153.0,"One of the impediments to large-scale use of wind generation within power systems is its nondispatchability and variable and uncertain real-time availability. Operating constraints on conventional generators such as minimum generation points, forbidden zones, and ramping limits as well as system constraints such as power flow limits and ancillary service requirements may force a system operator to curtail wind generation in order to ensure feasibility. Furthermore, the pattern of wind availability and electricity demand may not allow wind generation to be fully utilized in all hours. One solution to these issues, which could reduce these inflexibilities, is the use of real-time pricing (RTP) tariffs which can both smooth-out the diurnal load pattern in order to reduce the impact of binding unit operating and system constraints on wind utilization, and allow demand to increase in response to the availability of costless wind generation. We use and analyze a detailed unit commitment model of the Texas power system with different estimates of demand elasticities to demonstrate the potential increases in wind generation from implementing RTP. © 2009 IEEE.",Power system economics; Real-time pricing; Unit commitment; Variable renewable energy resources; Wind power generation,Ancillary service; Demand elasticities; Electricity demands; Load patterns; Non-dispatchability; Operating constraints; Power flows; Power system economics; Power systems; Real-time pricing; System constraints; System operator; Time availability; Unit commitment; Unit commitments; Variable renewable energy resources; Wind generation; Wind utilizations; Costs; Economics; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Internet protocols; Power transmission; Rapid thermal annealing; Real time systems; Wind power,Article
"Zhang L., Luh P.B.",Neural network-based market clearing price prediction and confidence interval estimation with an improved extended Kalman filter method,2005,152.0,"Market clearing prices (MCPs) play an important role in a deregulated power market, and good MCP prediction and confidence interval (CD estimation will help utilities and independent power producers submit effective bids with low risks. MCP prediction, however, is difficult, since MCP is a nonstationary process. Effective prediction, in principle, can be achieved by neural networks using extended Kalman filter (EKF) as an integrated adaptive learning and CI estimation method. EKF learning, however, is computationally expensive because it involves high dimensional matrix manipulations. This paper presents a modified U-D factorization method within the decoupled EKF (DEKF) framework. The computational speed and numerical stability of this resulting DEKF-UD method are significantly improved as compared to standard EKF. Testing results for a classroom problem and New England MCP predictions show that this new method provides smaller CIs than what provided by the BP-Bayesian method developed by the authors. Testing also shows that our new method has faster convergence, provides more accurate predictions as compared to BP-Bayesian, and our DEKF-UD MCP predictions are comparable in quality to ISO New England's predictions. © 2005 IEEE.",Confidence interval; Deregulated power market; Extended Kalman filter; Market clearing price; Neural networks; Prediction,Costs; Deregulation; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Kalman filtering; Learning algorithms; Marketing; Matrix algebra; Neural networks; Statistical methods; Confidence interval; Deregulated power market; Extended Kalman filter; Market clearing price; Electric power systems,Article
"Li G., Liu C.-C., Mattson C., Lawarrée J.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting in a grid environment,2007,150.0,"Accurate electricity price forecasting is critical to market participants in wholesale electricity markets. Market participants rely on price forecasts to decide their bidding strategies, allocate assets, negotiate bilateral contracts, hedge risks, and plan facility investments. Market operators can also use electricity price forecasts to predict market power indexes for the purpose of monitoring participants' behaviors. Various forecasting techniques are applied to different time horizons for electricity price forecasting in locational marginal pricing (LMP) spot markets. Available correlated data also have to be selected to improve the short-term forecasting performance. In this paper, fuzzy inference system (FIS), least-squares estimation (LSE), and the combination of FIS and LSE are proposed.

"Koopman S.J., Ooms M., Carnero M.A.",Periodic seasonal reg-ARFIMA-GARCH models for daily electricity spot prices,2007,149.0,"Novel periodic extensions of dynamic long-memory regression models with autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic errors are considered for the analysis of daily electricity spot prices. The parameters of the model with mean and variance specifications are estimated simultaneously by the method of approximate maximum likelihood. The methods are implemented for time series of 1,200-4,400 daily price observations in four European power markets. Apart from persistence, heteroscedasticity, and extreme observations in prices, a novel empirical finding is the importance of day-of-the-week periodicity in the autocovariance function of electricity spot prices. In particular, the very persistent daily log prices from the Nord Pool power exchange of Norway are effectively modeled by our framework, which is also extended with explanatory variables to capture supply-and-demand effects. The daily log prices of the other three electricity markets - EEX in Germany, Powernext in France, and APX in The Netherlands - are less persistent, but periodicity is also highly significant. The dynamic behavior differs from market to market and depends primarily on the method of power generation: hydro power, power generated from fossil fuels, or nuclear power. The article improves on existing models in capturing the memory characteristics, which are important in derivative pricing and real option analysis. © 2007 American Statistical Association.",Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model; Generalized autoregressive conditional heleroscedasticity model; Holiday effects; Long-memory process; Periodic autoregressive model; Volatility,,Review
"Shafie-Khah M., Moghaddam M.P., Sheikh-El-Eslami M.K.",Price forecasting of day-ahead electricity markets using a hybrid forecast method,2011,147.0,"Energy price forecasting in a competitive electricity market is crucial for the market participants in planning their operations and managing their risk, and it is also the key information in the economic optimization of the electric power industry. However, price series usually have a complex behavior due to their nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variancy. In this paper, a novel hybrid method to forecast day-ahead electricity price is proposed. This hybrid method is based on wavelet transform, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFN). The wavelet transform provides a set of better-behaved constitutive series than price series for prediction. ARIMA model is used to generate a linear forecast, and then RBFN is developed as a tool for nonlinear pattern recognition to correct the estimation error in wavelet-ARIMA forecast. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the network structure which makes the RBFN be adapted to the specified training set, reducing computation complexity and avoiding overfitting. The proposed method is examined on the electricity market of mainland Spain and the results are compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods. The results show that the proposed hybrid method could provide a considerable improvement for the forecasting accuracy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Lago J., De Ridder F., De Schutter B.",Forecasting spot electricity prices: Deep learning approaches and empirical comparison of traditional algorithms,2018,144.0,"In this paper, a novel modeling framework for forecasting electricity prices is proposed. While many predictive models have been already proposed to perform this task, the area of deep learning algorithms remains yet unexplored. To fill this scientific gap, we propose four different deep learning models for predicting electricity prices and we show how they lead to improvements in predictive accuracy. In addition, we also consider that, despite the large number of proposed methods for predicting electricity prices, an extensive benchmark is still missing. To tackle that, we compare and analyze the accuracy of 27 common approaches for electricity price forecasting. Based on the benchmark results, we show how the proposed deep learning models outperform the state-of-the-art methods and obtain results that are statistically significant. Finally, using the same results, we also show that: (i) machine learning methods yield, in general, a better accuracy than statistical models; (ii) moving average terms do not improve the predictive accuracy; (iii) hybrid models do not outperform their simpler counterparts. © 2018 The Author(s)",Benchmark study; Deep learning; Electricity price forecasting,Costs; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Power markets; Benchmark study; Electricity price forecasting; Empirical - comparisons; Forecasting electricity; Machine learning methods; Predictive accuracy; Spot electricity prices; State-of-the-art methods; Deep learning; accuracy assessment; benchmarking; comparative study; electricity; empirical analysis; forecasting method; learning; planning method; prediction; price dynamics,Article
"Zhang L., Luh P.B., Kasiviswanathan K.",Energy clearing price prediction and confidence interval estimation with cascaded neural networks,2003,144.0,"The energy market clearing prices (MCPs) in deregulated power markets are volatile. Good MCP prediction and its confidence interval estimation will help utilities and independent power producers submit effective bids with low risks. MCP prediction, however, is difficult since bidding strategies used by participants are complicated and various uncertainties interact in an intricate way. Furthermore, MCP predictors usually have a cascaded structure, as several key input factors need to be predicted first. Cascaded structures are widely used, however, they have not been adequately investigated. This paper analyzes the uncertainties involved in a cascaded neural-network (NN) structure for MCP prediction, and develops the prediction distribution under the Bayesian framework. A computationally efficient algorithm to evaluate the confidence intervals by using the memoryless Quasi-Newton method is also developed. Testing results on a classroom problem and on New England MCP prediction show that the method is computationally efficient and provides accurate prediction and confidence coverage. The scheme is generic, and can be applied to various networks, such as multilayer perceptrons and radial basis function networks.",Bayesian inference; Cascaded structure; Confidence interval; Market clearing price; Neural networks; Power systems; Prediction; Risk management,Algorithms; Computational methods; Electric rates; Estimation; Multilayer neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Deregulated power markets; Electric utilities,Article
"Yang Z., Ce L., Lian L.","Electricity price forecasting by a hybrid model, combining wavelet transform, ARMA and kernel-based extreme learning machine methods",2017,141.0,"Electricity prices have rather complex features such as high volatility, high frequency, nonlinearity, mean reversion and non-stationarity that make forecasting very difficult. However, accurate electricity price forecasting is essential to market traders, retailers, and generation companies. To improve prediction accuracy using each model's unique features, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines the wavelet transform, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) based on self-adapting particle swarm optimization and an auto regressive moving average (ARMA). Self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) is adopted to search for the optimal kernel parameters of the KELM. After testing the wavelet decomposition components, stationary series as new input sets are predicted by the ARMA model and non-stationary series are predicted by the SAPSO-KELM model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using electricity price data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), Australian and Spanish markets. The experimental results show that the developed method has more accurate prediction, better generality and practicability than individual methods and other hybrid methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",ARMA; Electricity price forecasting; KELM; SAPSO; Wavelet transform,Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Time series analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; ARMA; Autoregressive moving average; Decomposition components; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme learning machine; KELM; Non-stationary series; SAPSO; Power markets; accuracy assessment; electricity generation; energy market; machine learning; nonlinearity; numerical model; optimization; price dynamics; Australia; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; United States,Article

"Panapakidis I.P., Dagoumas A.S.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting via the application of artificial neural network based models,2016,136.0,"Traditionally, short-term electricity price forecasting has been essential for utilities and generation companies. However, the deregulation of electricity markets created a competitive environment and the introduction of new market participants, such as the retailers and aggregators, whose economic viability and profitability highly depends on the spot market price patterns. The aim of this study is to examine artificial neural network (ANN) based models for Day-ahead price forecasting. Specifically, the models refer to the sole application of ANNs or to hybrid models, where the ANN is combined with clustering algorithm. The training data are clustered in homogenous groups and for each cluster, a dedicated forecaster is employed. The proposed models are characterized by comprehensive operation and by high level of flexibility; different inputs can be taken under consideration and different ANN topologies can be examined. The models are tested on a data set that consists of atypical price patterns and many outliers. This approach makes the price forecasting problem a more challenging task, providing evidence that the proposed models can be considered as useful and robust forecasting tools to the actual needs of market participants, including the traditional generation companies and self-producers, but also the retailers/suppliers and aggregators. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial neural networks; Day-ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Time-series clustering,Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Competitive environment; Day ahead market; Economic viability; Electricity price forecasting; Generation companies; Market participants; Price forecasting; Time series clustering; Power markets,Article
"Mandal P., Senjyu T., Funabashi T.",Neural networks approach to forecast several hour ahead electricity prices and loads in deregulated market,2006,135.0,"In daily power markets, forecasting electricity prices and loads are the most essential task and the basis for any decision making. An approach to predict the market behaviors is to use the historical prices, loads and other required information to forecast the future prices and loads. This paper introduces an approach for several hour ahead (1-6 h) electricity price and load forecasting using an artificial intelligence method, such as a neural network model, which uses publicly available data from the NEMMCO web site to forecast electricity prices and loads for the Victorian electricity market. An approach of selection of similar days is proposed according to which the load and price curves are forecasted by using the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. A Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of the similar days. Two different ANN models, one for one to six hour ahead load forecasting and another for one to six hour ahead price forecasting have been proposed. The MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) results show a clear increasing trend with the increase in hour ahead load and price forecasting. The sample average of MAPEs for one hour ahead price forecasts is 9.75%. This figure increases to only 20.03% for six hour ahead predictions. Similarly, the one to six hour ahead load forecast errors (MAPE) range from 0.56% to 1.30% only. MAPE results show that several hour ahead electricity prices and loads in the deregulated Victorian market can be forecasted with reasonable accuracy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Clò S., Cataldi A., Zoppoli P.",The merit-order effect in the Italian power market: The impact of solar and wind generation on national wholesale electricity prices,2015,131.0,"Italy promoted one of the most generous renewable support schemes worldwide which resulted in a high increase of solar power generation. We analyze the Italian day-ahead wholesale electricity market, finding empirical evidence of the merit-order effect. Over the period 2005-2013 an increase of 1. GWh in the hourly average of daily production from solar and wind sources has, on average, reduced wholesale electricity prices by respectively 2.3€/MWh and 4.2€/MWh and has amplified their volatility. The impact on prices has decreased over time in correspondence with the increase in solar and wind electricity production. We estimate that, over the period 2009-2013, solar production has generated higher monetary savings than wind production, mainly because the former is more prominent than the latter. However, in the solar case, monetary savings are not sufficient to compensate the cost of the related supporting schemes which are entirely internalized within end-user tariffs, causing a reduction of the consumer surplus, while the opposite occurs in the case of wind. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity price; Feed-in tariff; Italian wholesale power market; Merit-order effect; Renewables,Commerce; Costs; Power markets; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Electricity prices; Feed-in tariff; Ordering effects; Renewables; Solar production; Supporting scheme; Wholesale electricity; Wholesale electricity markets; Electric power generation; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; power generation; price determination; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Italy,Article
"Wang D., Luo H., Grunder O., Lin Y., Guo H.",Multi-step ahead electricity price forecasting using a hybrid model based on two-layer decomposition technique and BP neural network optimized by firefly algorithm,2017,128.0,"In the deregulated competitive electricity market, the price which reflects the relationship between electricity supply and demand is one of the most important elements, making it crucial for all market participants to precisely forecast the electricity price. However, electricity price series usually has complex features such as non-linearity, non-stationarity and volatility, which makes the price forecasting turn out to be very difficult. In order to improve the accuracy of electricity price forecasting, this paper first proposes a two-layer decomposition technique and then develops a hybrid model based on fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition (FEEMD), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and back propagation (BP) neural network optimized by firefly algorithm (FA). The proposed model is unique in the sense that VMD is specifically applied to further decompose the high frequency intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) generated by FEEMD into a number of modes in order to improve the forecast accuracy. To validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model, three electricity price series respectively collected from the real-world electricity markets of Australia and France are adopted to conduct the empirical study. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the other considered models over horizons of one-step, two-step, four-step and six-step ahead forecasting, which shows that the proposed model has superior performances for both one-step and multi-step ahead forecasting of electricity price. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Back propagation neural network; Electricity price forecasting; Fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Firefly algorithm; Multi-step ahead; Variational mode decomposition,Backpropagation algorithms; Bioluminescence; Commerce; Competition; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Optimization; Signal processing; Back propagation neural networks; Electricity price forecasting; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Firefly algorithms; Mode decomposition; Multi-step; Power markets; artificial neural network; back propagation; decomposition; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy market; numerical model; optimization; price dynamics; Australia; France,Article
"Singhal D., Swarup K.S.",Electricity price forecasting using artificial neural networks,2011,128.0,"Electricity price forecasting in deregulated open power markets using neural networks is presented. Forecasting electricity price is a challenging task for on-line trading and e-commerce. Bidding competition is one of the main transaction approaches after deregulation. Forecasting the hourly market-clearing prices (MCP) in daily power markets is the most essential task and basis for any decision making in order to maximize the benefits. Artificial neural networks are found to be most suitable tool as they can map the complex interdependencies between electricity price, historical load and other factors. The neural network approach is used to predict the market behaviors based on the historical prices, quantities and other information to forecast the future prices and quantities. The basic idea is to use history and other estimated factors in the future to ""fit"" and ""extrapolate"" the prices and quantities. A neural network method to forecast the market-clearing prices (MCPs) for day-ahead energy markets is developed. The structure of the neural network is a three-layer back propagation (BP) network. The price forecasting results using the neural network model shows that the electricity price in the deregulated markets is dependent strongly on the trend in load demand and clearing price. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Wan C., Xu Z., Wang Y., Dong Z.Y., Wong K.P.",A hybrid approach for probabilistic forecasting of electricity price,2014,124.0,"The electricity market plays a key role in realizing the economic prophecy of smart grids. Accurate and reliable electricity market price forecasting is essential to facilitate various decision making activities of market participants in the future smart grid environment. However, due to the nonstationarities involved in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather difficult to accurately predict MCPs in advance. The challenge is getting intensified as more and more renewable energy and other new technologies emerged in smart grids. Therefore transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts can be of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts, thus effectively supporting the decision making activities against uncertainties and risks ahead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to construct prediction intervals of MCPs with a two-stage formulation. In the first stage, extreme learning machine (ELM) is applied to estimate point forecasts of MCPs and model uncertainties involved. In the second stage, the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the noise variance. A generalized and comprehensive evaluation framework for probabilistic electricity price forecasting is proposed in this paper.

"Zhao J.H., Dong Z.Y., Xu Z., Wong K.P.",A statistical approach for interval forecasting of the electricity price,2008,124.0,"Electricity price forecasting is a difficult yet essential task for market participants in a deregulated electricity market. Rather than forecasting the value, market participants are sometimes more interested in forecasting the prediction interval of the electricity price. Forecasting the prediction interval is essential for estimating the uncertainty involved in the price and thus is highly useful for making generation bidding strategies and investment decisions. In this paper, a novel data mining-based approach is proposed to achieve two major objectives: 1) to accurately forecast the value of the electricity price series, which is widely accepted as a nonlinear time series; 2) to accurately estimate the prediction interval of the electricity price series. In the proposed approach, support vector machine (SVM) is employed to forecast the value of the price. To forecast the prediction interval, we construct a statistical model by introducing a heteroscedastic variance equation for the SVM. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is used to estimate model parameters. Results from the case studies on real-world price data prove that the proposed method is highly effective compared with existing methods such as GARCH models. © 2008 IEEE.",Data mining; Electricity market price forecasting; Interval forecasting; Support vector machine,Data mining; Forecasting; Marketing; Maximum likelihood estimation; Operating costs; Support vector machines; Time series analysis; Electricity market price forecasting; Interval forecasting; Prediction interval; Electric industry,Article

"Gareta R., Romeo L.M., Gil A.",Forecasting of electricity prices with neural networks,2006,120.0,"During recent years, the electricity energy market deregulation has led to a new free competition situation in Europe and other countries worldwide. Generators, distributors and qualified clients have some uncertainties about the future evolution of electricity markets. In consequence, feasibility studies of new generation plants, design of new systems and energy management optimization are frequently postponed. The ability of forecasting energy prices, for instance the electricity prices, would be highly appreciated in order to improve the profitability of utility investments. The development of new simulation techniques, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), has provided a good tool to forecast time series. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the Neural Network (NN) approach can be used to forecast short term hourly electricity pool prices (for the next day and two or three days after). The NN architecture and design for prices forecasting are described in this paper. The results are tested with extensive data sets, and good agreement is found between actual data and NN results. This methodology could help to improve power plant generation capacity management and, certainly, more profitable operation in daily energy pools. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed framework combines a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) forecasting engine for joint price and demand prediction with data association mining (DAM) algorithms. In this framework, a DAM-based rule extraction mechanism is used to determine and extract the patterns in consumers' reaction to price forecasts.

Sioshansi R.,Evaluating the impacts of real-time pricing on the cost and value of wind generation,2010,112.0,"One of the costs associated with integrating wind generation into a power system is the cost of redispatching the system in real-time due to day-ahead wind resource forecast errors. One possible way of reducing these redispatch costs is to introduce demand response in the form of real-time pricing (RTP), which could allow electricity demand to respond to actual real-time wind resource availability using price signals. A day-ahead unit commitment model with day-ahead wind forecasts and a real-time dispatch model with actual wind resource availability is used to estimate system operations in a high wind penetration scenario. System operations are compared to a perfect foresight benchmark, in which actual wind resource availability is known day-ahead. The results show that wind integration costs with fixed demands can be high, both due to real-time redispatch costs and lost load. It is demonstrated that introducing RTP can reduce redispatch costs and eliminate loss of load events. Finally, social surplus with wind generation and RTP is compared to a system with neither and the results demonstrate that introducing wind and RTP into a market can result in superadditive surplus gains. © 2010 IEEE.",Power system economics; Real-time pricing; Unit commitment; Wind forecast errors; Wind power generation,Power system economics; Real time pricing; Unit commitments; Wind forecast errors; Wind forecasts; Cost reduction; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Errors; Integration; Internet protocols; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Electric load forecasting,Article
"Zareipour H., Cañzares C.A., Bhattacharya K., Thomson J.",Application of public-domain market information to forecast Ontario's wholesale electricity prices,2006,112.0,"This paper evaluates the usefulness of publicly available electricity market information in forecasting the hourly Ontario energy price (HOEP). In order to do so, relevant data from Ontario and its neighboring electricity markets, namely, New York, New England, and PJM electricity markets, are investigated, and a final set of explanatory variable candidates that are available before real-time are selected. Multivariate transfer function and dynamic regression models are employed to relate HOEP behavior to the selected explanatory variable candidates. Univariate ARIMA models are also developed for the HOEP. The HOEP models are developed on the basis of two forecasting horizons, i.e., 3 h and 24 h, and forecasting performance of the multivariate models is compared with that of the univariate models. The outcomes show that the market information publicly available before real-time can be used to improve HOEP forecast accuracy to some extent; however, unusually high or low prices remain unpredictable, and hence, the available data cannot lead to significantly more accurate forecasts. Nevertheless, the generated forecasts in this paper are significantly more accurate than currently available HOEP forecasts. To analyze the relatively low accuracy of the HOEP forecasts, comparisons are made with respect to ARIMA models developed for locational marginal prices (LMPs) of Ontario's three neighboring markets, and price volatility analyses are presented. © 2006 IEEE.",Electricity markets; Price forecasting; Time series models; Volatility analysis,Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Marketing; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Transfer functions; Electricity markets; Price forecasting; Volatility analysis; Electric power systems,Article
"Keles D., Scelle J., Paraschiv F., Fichtner W.",Extended forecast methods for day-ahead electricity spot prices applying artificial neural networks,2016,109.0,"Day-ahead electricity prices are generally used as reference prices for decisions done in energy trading, e.g. purchase and sale strategies are typically based on the day-ahead spot prices. Therefore, well-performing forecast methods for day-ahead electricity prices are essential for energy traders and supply companies.In this paper, a methodology based on artificial neuronal networks (ANN) is presented to forecast electricity prices. As the performance of an ANN forecast model depends on appropriate input parameter sets, the focus is set on the selection and preparation of fundamental data that has a noticeable impact on electricity prices. This is done with the help of different cluster algorithms, but also by comparing the results of the pre-selected model configurations in combination with different input parameter settings. After the determination of the optimal input parameters, affecting day-ahead electricity prices, and well-performing ANN configuration, the developed ANN model is applied for in-sample and out-of-sample analyses. The results show that the overall methodology leads to well-fitting electricity price forecasts, whereas forecast errors are as low as or even lower than other forecast models for electricity prices known from the literature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial neuronal network; Day-ahead-market; Electricity prices; Input selection; Price forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Neural networks; Neurons; Artificial neuronal network; Day ahead market; Electricity prices; Input selection; Price forecasting; Power markets; algorithm; artificial neural network; electricity generation; energy market; forecasting method,Article

"Khotanzad A., Zhou E., Elragal H.",A neuro-fuzzy approach to short-term load forecasting in a price-sensitive environment,2002,108.0,"This paper presents a new approach to short-term load forecasting in a deregulated and price-sensitive environment. A real-time pricing type scenario is envisioned where energy prices could change on an hourly basis with the consumer having the ability to react to the price signal through shifting his electricity usage from expensive hours to other times when possible. The load profile under this scenario would have different characteristics compared to that of the regulated, fixed-price era. Consequently, short-term load forecasting models customized on price-insensitive (PIS) historical data of regulated era would no longer be able to perform well. In this work, a price-sensitive (PS) load forecaster is developed. This forecaster consists of two stages, an artificial neural network based PIS load forecaster followed by a fuzzy logic (FL) system that transforms the PIS load forecasts of the first stage into PS forecasts.

"Zhao J.H., Dong Z.Y., Li X., Wong K.P.",A framework for electricity price spike analysis with advanced data mining methods,2007,107.0,"There are many techniques for electricity market price forecasting. However, most of them are designed for expected price analysis rather than price spike forecasting. An effective method of predicting the occurrence of spikes has not yet been observed in the literature so far. In this paper, a data mining-based approach is presented to give a reliable forecast of the occurrence of price spikes. Combined with the spike value prediction techniques developed by the same authors, the proposed approach aims at providing a comprehensive tool for price spike forecasting. In this paper, feature selection techniques are first described to identify the attributes relevant to the occurrence of spikes. A simple introduction to the classification techniques is given for completeness. Two algorithms - support vector machine and probability classifier - are chosen to be the spike occurrence predictors and are discussed in detail. Realistic market data are used to test the proposed model with promising results. © 2007 IEEE.",Classification; Data mining; Electricity market; Electricity price forecast; Feature selection; Price spike reduction,Costs; Data mining; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Marketing; Probability; Support vector machines; Electricity market; Electricity price spike analysis; Probability classifier; Electricity,Article
"Gao F., Guan X., Cao X.-R., Papalexpoulos A.",Forecasting power market clearing price and quantity using a neural network method,2000,106.0,"Deregulation of the electric power industry worldwide raises many challenging issues. Forecasting the hourly market clearing prices and quantities in daily power markets is the most essential task and basis for any decision making. One approach to predict the market behaviors is to use the historical prices, quantities and other information to forecast the future prices and quantities. The basic idea is to use history and other estimated factors in the future to ""fit"" and ""extrapolate"" the prices and quantities. Aiming at this challenging task, we developed a neural network method to forecast the MCPs and MCQs for the California day-ahead energy markets. The structure of the neural network is a three-layer back propagation (BP) network. The historical MCPs and MCQs of California day-ahead energy market, the ISO load forecasts and other public information that may influence the markets are used for training, validating and forecasting test.

"Zugno M., Morales J.M., Pinson P., Madsen H.",Pool strategy of a price-maker wind power producer,2013,102.0,"We consider the problem of a wind power producer trading energy in short-term electricity markets. The producer is a price-taker in the day-ahead market, but a price-maker in the balancing market, and aims at optimizing its expected revenues from these market floors. The problem is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and cast as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which can be solved employing off-the-shelf optimization software. The optimal bid is shown to deliver significantly improved performance compared to traditional bids such as the conditional mean or median forecast of wind power distribution. Finally, sensitivity analyses are carried out to assess the impact on the offering strategy of the producer's penetration in the market, of the correlation between wind power production and residual system deviation, and of the shape of the forecast distribution of wind power production. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Electricity markets; mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints; offering strategies; price-maker; wind power,Electricity market; Forecast distribution; Mathematical program with equilibrium constraints; Mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints; Mixed integer linear program; offering strategies; price-maker; Wind power distribution; Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Integer programming; Optimization; Wind power; Weather forecasting,Article
"Gollou A.R., Ghadimi N.",A new feature selection and hybrid forecast engine for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets,2017,98.0,"In this paper, a new feature selection and forecast engine is presented for day ahead prediction of electricity prices, which are so valuable for both producers and consumers in the new competitive electric power markets. In a competitive electricity market, forecast of energy prices is a key information for the market participants. However, price signal usually has a complex behavior due to its nonlinearity, non-stationary, and time variance. Also, an appropriate feature selection is crucial for accurate forecasting. In this paper, a two-step approach that identifies a set of candidate features based on the data characteristics proposed and then selects a subset of them using correlation and instance-based feature selection methods, applied in a systematic way. Then, a combination of wavelet transform (WT) and a hybrid forecast method is presented based on neural network (NN) and an optimization algorithms.

"Ghasemi A., Shayeghi H., Moradzadeh M., Nooshyar M.",A novel hybrid algorithm for electricity price and load forecasting in smart grids with demand-side management,2016,98.0,"Smart grid is a platform that enables the participants of electricity market to adjust their bidding strategies based on Demand-Side Management (DSM) models. Responsiveness of the market participants can improve reliability of system operation as well as capital cost investments. In this regard, the accurate forecast of electricity price and demand in smart grids is an important challenge as their strong correlation makes a separate forecasting to be ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneous forecast of price and demand that uses a set of effective tools in preprocessing part, forecast engine and tuned algorithm. To highlight our contributions, the proposed forecast algorithm classified into three main parts. The first part employs a new Flexible Wavelet Packet Transform (FWPT) to decompose a signal into multiple terms at different frequencies, and a new feature selection method that employs Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) and adjacent features in order to select valuable input data. The second part consists of a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model based on Nonlinear Least Square Support Vector Machine (NLSSVM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in order to model the linear and nonlinear correlation between price and load in two stages. The final part employs a modified version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm based on time-varying coefficients and stumble generation operator, called TV-SABC, in order to optimize NLSSVM parameters in a learning process. The proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm is evaluated on several real and well-known markets illustrating its high accuracy in simultaneous forecast of electricity price and demand. Moreover, the interactive effects of demand-side management programs on load factor (load curve) and price signal are investigated by numerical indices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Demand-side management; Feature selection; Load and price forecasting; Smart grids; Wavelet transform,Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Demand side management; Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Investments; Learning algorithms; MIMO systems; Optimization; Packet networks; Power markets; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Conditional mutual information; Feature selection methods; Multi-input-multi-output models; Price forecasting; Smart grid; Wavelet packet transforms; Smart power grids; algorithm; capital market; correlation; demand analysis; demand-side management; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; wavelet analysis; Apoidea,Article
"Vahidinasab V., Jadid S., Kazemi A.",Day-ahead price forecasting in restructured power systems using artificial neural networks,2008,98.0,"Over the past 15 years most electricity supply companies around the world have been restructured from monopoly utilities to deregulated competitive electricity markets. Market participants in the restructured electricity markets find short-term electricity price forecasting (STPF) crucial in formulating their risk management strategies. They need to know future electricity prices as their profitability depends on them. This research project classifies and compares different techniques of electricity price forecasting in the literature and selects artificial neural networks (ANN) as a suitable method for price forecasting. To perform this task, market knowledge should be used to optimize the selection of input data for an electricity price forecasting tool. Then sensitivity analysis is used in this research to aid in the selection of the optimum inputs of the ANN and fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm is used for daily load pattern clustering. Finally, ANN with a modified Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning algorithm are implemented for forecasting prices in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market.

"Pino R., Parreno J., Gomez A., Priore P.",Forecasting next-day price of electricity in the Spanish energy market using artificial neural networks,2008,92.0,"In this paper, next-day hourly forecasts are calculated for the energy price in the electricity production market of Spain. The methodology used to achieve these forecasts is based on artificial neural networks, which have been used successfully in recent years in many forecasting applications. The days to be forecast include working days as well as weekends and holidays, due to the fact that energy price has different behaviours depending on the kind of day to be forecast. Besides, energy price time series are usually composed of too many data, which could be a problem if we are looking for a short period of time to reach an adequate forecast. In this paper, a training method for artificial neural nets is proposed, which is based on making a previous selection for the multilayer perceptron (MLP) training samples, using an ART-type neural network. The MLP is then trained and finally used to calculate forecasts. These forecasts are compared to those obtained from the well-known Box-Jenkins ARIMA forecasting method. Results show that neural nets perform better than ARIMA models, especially for weekends and holidays. Both methodologies calculate more accurate forecasts-in terms of mean absolute percentage error-for working days that for weekends and holidays. Agents involved in the electricity production market, who may need fast forecasts for the price of electricity, would benefit from the results of this study. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"García-Martos C., Rodríguez J., Sánchez M.J.",Mixed models for short-run forecasting of electricity prices: Application for the Spanish market,2007,90.0,"Short-run forecasting of electricity prices has become necessary for power generation unit schedule, since it is the basis of every profit maximization strategy. In this article a new and very easy method to compute accurate forecasts for electricity prices using mixed models is proposed. The main idea is to develop an efficient tool for one-step-ahead forecasting in the future, combining several prediction methods for which forecasting performance has been checked and compared for a span of several years. Also as a novelty, the 24 hourly time series has been modelled separately, instead of the complete time series of the prices. This allows one to take advantage of the homogeneity of these 24 time series. The purpose of this paper is to select the model that leads to smaller prediction errors and to obtain the appropriate length of time to use for forecasting. These results have been obtained by means of a computational experiment. A mixed model which combines the advantages of the two new models discussed is proposed. Some numerical results for the Spanish market are shown, but this new methodology can be applied to other electricity markets as well. © 2007 IEEE.",Design of experiments; Electricity markets; Forecasting; Marginal price; Time series analysis,Design of experiments; Electric utilities; Error analysis; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Time series analysis; Utility rates; Electricity prices; Marginal price; Mixed models; Electric industry,Article
"Lu X., Dong Z.Y., Li X.",Electricity market price spike forecast with data mining techniques,2005,89.0,"Electricity market price forecast is a changeling yet very important task for electricity market managers and participants. Due to the complexity and uncertainties in the power grid, electricity prices are highly volatile and normally carry with spikes, which may be tens or even hundreds of times higher than the normal price. Such electricity spikes are very difficult to be predicted. So far, most of the research on electricity price forecast is based on the normal range electricity prices. This paper proposes a data mining based electricity price forecast framework, which can predict the normal price as well as the price spikes. The normal price can be predicted by a previously proposed wavelet and neural network based forecast model, while the spikes are forecasted based on a data mining approach. This paper focuses on the spike prediction and explores the reasons for price spikes based on the measurement of a proposed composite supply-demand balance index (SDI) and relative demand index (RDI). These indices are able to reflect the relationship among electricity demand, electricity supply and electricity reserve capacity. The proposed model is based on a mining database including market clearing price, trading hour, electricity demand, electricity supply and reserve. Bayesian classification and similarity searching techniques are used to mine the database to find out the internal relationships between electricity price spikes and these proposed. The mining results are used to form the price spike forecast model. This proposed model is able to generate forecasted price spike, level of spike and associated forecast confidence level. The model is tested with the Queensland electricity market data with promising results. Crown Copyright © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Anbazhagan S., Kumarappan N.",Day-ahead deregulated electricity market price forecasting using recurrent neural network,2013,88.0,"This paper proposes a recurrent neural network model for the day ahead deregulated electricity market price forecasting that could be realized using the Elman network. In a deregulated market, electricity price is influenced by many factors and exhibits a very complicated and irregular fluctuation. Both power producers and consumers need a single compact and robust price forecasting tool for maximizing their profits and utilities. In order to validate the chaotic characteristic of electricity price, an Elman network is modeled. The proposed Elman network is a single compact and robust architecture (without hybridizing the various hard and soft computing models). It has been observed that a nearly state of the art Elman network forecasting accuracy can be achieved with less computation time. The proposed Elman network approach is compared with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), mixed model, neural network, wavelet ARIMA, weighted nearest neighbors, fuzzy neural network, hybrid intelligent system, adaptive wavelet neural network, neural networks with wavelet transform, wavelet transform and a hybrid of neural networks and fuzzy logic, wavelet-ARIMA radial basis function neural networks, cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm, and wavelet transform, particle swarm optimization, and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system approaches to forecast the electricity market of mainland Spain.

"Shrivastava N.A., Khosravi A., Panigrahi B.K.",Prediction Interval Estimation of Electricity Prices Using PSO-Tuned Support Vector Machines,2015,87.0,"Uncertainty of the electricity prices makes the task of accurate forecasting quite difficult for the electricity market participants. Prediction intervals (PIs) are statistical tools which quantify the uncertainty related to forecasts by estimating the ranges of the future electricity prices. Traditional approaches based on neural networks (NNs) generate PIs at the cost of high computational burden and doubtful assumptions about data distributions. In this work, we propose a novel technique that is not plagued with the above limitations and it generates high-quality PIs in a short time. The proposed method directly generates the lower and upper bounds of the future electricity prices using support vector machines (SVM). Optimal model parameters are obtained by the minimization of a modified PI-based objective function using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique.

"Guo J.-J., Luh P.B.",Improving market clearing price prediction by using a committee machine of neural networks,2004,87.0,"Predicting market clearing prices is an important but difficult task, and neural networks have been widely used. A single neural network, however, may misrepresent part of the input-output data mapping that could have been correctly represented by different networks. The use of a ""committee machine"" composed of multiple networks can in principle alleviate such a difficulty. A major challenge for using a committee machine is to properly combine predictions from multiple networks, since the performance of individual networks is input dependent due to mapping misrepresentation. This paper presents a new method in which weighting coefficients for combining network predictions are the probabilities that individual networks capture the true input-output relationship at that prediction instant. Testing of the New England market cleaning prices demonstrates that the new method performs better than individual networks, and better than committee machines using current ensemble-averaging methods. © 2004 IEEE.",Committee machines; Energy price forecasting; Multiple model approach; Neural networks,Forecasting; Marketing; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Probability; Statistical methods; Committee machines; Energy price forecasting; Market clearing prices; Multiple model approach; Electric power systems,Article

"Shrivastava N.A., Panigrahi B.K.",A hybrid wavelet-ELM based short term price forecasting for electricity markets,2014,83.0,"Accurate electricity price forecasting is a formidable challenge for market participants and managers owing to high volatility of the electricity prices. Price forecasting is also the most important management goal for market participants since it forms the basis of maximizing profits. This study investigates the performance of a novel neural network technique called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in the price forecasting problem. Keeping in view the risk associated with electricity markets with highly volatile prices, relying on a single technique is not so profitable. Therefore ELM has been coupled with the Wavelet technique to develop a hybrid model termed as WELM (wavelet based ELM) to improve the forecasting accuracy as well as reliability. In this way, the unique features of each tool are combined to capture different patterns in the data. The robustness of the model is further enhanced using the ensembling technique. Performances of the proposed models are evaluated by using data from Ontario, PJM, New York and Italian Electricity markets.

"Hobbs B.F., Hu M.-C., Iñón J.G., Stoft S.E., Bhavaraju M.P.",A dynamic analysis of a demand curve-based capacity market proposal: The PJM reliability pricing model,2007,82.0,"Because of high generation adequacy standards in the power industry, some peaking capacity operates for a limited time during the year and may not receive sufficient energy revenues to meet its fixed costs. This is particularly true when energy prices are capped in order to mitigate market power. The northeastern U.S. independent system operators (ISOs) have responded to this issue by establishing capacity obligations for loads and markets for installed capacity, thus providing a capacity revenue stream to generators. The installed capacity (ICAP) markets in the northeastern U.S. markets are a response to this need for additional incentives to construct generation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has accepted the PJM Interconnection's (PJM) proposal to replace the present fixed ICAP requirement that is placed upon load serving entities (LSEs) with a demand curve-based system in which the ISO would be responsible for acquiring ""residual"" capacity on behalf of LSEs. The demand curve approach pays more when reserve margins are smaller and provides a reduced incentive for investment when installed reserves are above the target. Another goal is to make revenues more predictable for generators, making investment less costly and, ultimately, lowering prices for consumers. A dynamic representative agent model is presented for projecting effects upon reserve margins, generator profitability, and consumer costs and is applied to alternative demand curves proposed for the PJM market. The consumer costs resulting from a sloped demand curve are robustly lower compared to the present fixed requirement under a wide range of assumptions concerning behavior of generation owners, including risk attitudes, bidding behavior, and willingness to build capacity as a function of forecast profit. The cost savings arise from lower capital costs to generators due to reduced risk and risk premiums. Also, average installed capacity is less for the same level of reliability because of reduced fluctuations in installed reserves. © 2007 IEEE.",Economics; Power generation economics; Power generation peaking capacity,Costs; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Forecasting; Industrial economics; Investments; Marketing; Mathematical models; Reliability theory; Independent system operators; Power generation economics; Power generation peaking capacity; Reliability pricing model; Electric power systems,Article

Furthermore, given the volatility of power prices and concerns about accurate forecasting under extreme price excursions, we evaluate the results using various error metrics including expected shortfall.

"Hong Y.-Y., Lee C.-F.",A neuro-fuzzy price forecasting approach in deregulated electricity markets,2005,80.0,"Bidding competition is a main transaction approach in a deregulated market. Locational marginal prices (LMPs) resulting from bidding competition signal electricity values at a node or in an area. The LMP reveals important information for market participants to develop their bidding strategies. Moreover, LMP is also a vital indicator for the Security Coordinator to perform market redispatch for congestion management. This paper presents a method using fuzzy reasoning and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting LMPs. The fuzzy rules are used to perform the linguistic reasoning about the contingencies. The reasoning results serve as a part of inputs to the RNNs for forecasting the LMPs. The historical LMPs in the PJM market are used to test the proposed method. It is found that the proposed neuro-fuzzy method is capable of forecasting LMP values efficiently. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"Lago J., De Ridder F., Vrancx P., De Schutter B.",Forecasting day-ahead electricity prices in Europe: The importance of considering market integration,2018,78.0,"Motivated by the increasing integration among electricity markets, in this paper we propose two different methods to incorporate market integration in electricity price forecasting and to improve the predictive performance. First, we propose a deep neural network that considers features from connected markets to improve the predictive accuracy in a local market. To measure the importance of these features, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm that, by using Bayesian optimization and functional analysis of variance, evaluates the effect of the features on the algorithm performance. In addition, using market integration, we propose a second model that, by simultaneously predicting prices from two markets, improves the forecasting accuracy even further. As a case study, we consider the electricity market in Belgium and the improvements in forecasting accuracy when using various French electricity features. We show that the two proposed models lead to improvements that are statistically significant. Particularly, due to market integration, the predictive accuracy is improved from 15.7% to 12.5% sMAPE (symmetric mean absolute percentage error). In addition, we show that the proposed feature selection algorithm is able to perform a correct assessment, i.e. to discard the irrelevant features. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bayesian optimization; Deep neural networks; Electricity market integration; Electricity price forecasting; Functional ANOVA,Bayesian networks; Commerce; Costs; Deep neural networks; Electric industry; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Integration; Optimization; Algorithm performance; Bayesian optimization; Electricity price forecasting; Feature selection algorithm; Forecasting accuracy; Functional ANOVA; Mean absolute percentage error; Predictive performance; Power markets; algorithm; artificial neural network; electricity; energy market; forecasting method; integrated approach; market conditions; optimization; price determination; variance analysis; Belgium,Article

Due to the complicated factors affecting electricity prices, accurate price forecasting turns out to be very difficult. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach has been extended to make hourly market clearing price (MCP) forecasting in electricity spot markets with error correction and confidence interval estimation. The ARIMA model used for forecasting price and the method to implement price forecasting are presented first. Then the ARIMA approach is extended to include error correction for improving accuracy of price forecasting. Moreover, the confidence interval of the forecasted prices is estimated assuming the residual errors are in gaussian or uniform distribution. Hourly MCP forecasting of the Californian Power Market is used as a computer example, and the comparison with conventional ARIMA approach is given. Computer test results show clearly that the suggested extended ARIMA approach for spot price forecasting is very effective with satisfactory accuracy. It can work under very worse market conditions with high price volatility.",,Decision making; Electricity; Error correction; Estimation; Investments; '; Bidding strategies; Electricity prices; Market clearing price (MCP); Electric load forecasting,Article

In this study, support vector machine (SVM) has been used as a function approximation tool for a price series and genetic algorithm (GA) has been utilised for optimisation of the parameters of the SVM model. Instead of using single time series, separate time series for each trading interval has been employed to model each day's price profile, and SVM parameters of these separate series have been optimised using GA. The developed model has been applied to two large power systems from National electricity market (NEM) of Australia. The forecasting performance of the proposed model has been compared with a heuristic technique, a linear regression model and the other reported works in the literature. Effect of price volatility on the performance of the models has also been analysed.

Rathmann M.,Do support systems for RES-E reduce EU-ETS-driven electricity prices?,2007,75.0,"Support systems for electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) can reduce electricity prices which have also been influenced by a CO2 emission trading scheme (ETS): Additional RES-E substitutes electricity from fossil fuels, and thus CO2-emissions are reduced. The demand for emission reductions is lowered, as a result the CO2-price is also reduced. Consequently the wholesale price for electricity decreases. However, most RES-E support systems are financed via the electricity market, which increases the retail electricity price. An assessment for Germany shows that retail electricity prices in the first trading period of the EU-ETS 2005-2007 are lowered by 2.6 Euro / MWh due to additional RES-E. Considering the complete EU, the effect is substantially higher. This paper describes the effect and the influence of different policy designs. It develops an approach for assessing the effect and applies it for the case of Germany and roughly estimates the effect for the EU. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Kumar M.D.,Impact of electricity prices and volumetric water allocation on energy and groundwater demand management: Analysis from Western India,2005,75.0,"In recent years, power tariff policy has been increasingly advocated as a mean to influence groundwater use and withdrawal decisions of farmers in view of the failure of existing direct and indirect regulations on groundwater withdrawal in India. Many researchers argue that pro rata electricity tariff, with built in positive marginal cost of pumping could bring about efficient use of the resource, though some argue that the levels of tariff in which demand becomes elastic to pricing are too high to be viable from political and socio-economic points of view. The paper presents a theoretical model to analyze farmers' response to changes in power tariff and water allocation regimes vis à vis energy and groundwater use. It validates the model by analyzing water productivity in groundwater irrigation under different electricity pricing structures and water allocation regimes. Water productivity was estimated using primary data of gross crop inputs, cost of all inputs, and volumetric water inputs. The analysis shows that unit pricing of electricity influences groundwater use efficiency and productivity positively. It also shows that the levels of pricing at which demand for electricity and groundwater becomes elastic to tariff are socio-economically viable. Further, water productivity impacts of pricing would be highest when water is volumetrically allocated with rationing. Therefore, an effective power tariff policy followed by enforcement of volumetric water allocation could address the issue of efficiency, sustainability and equity in groundwater use in India. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

"Ford A., Vogstad K., Flynn H.",Simulating price patterns for tradable green certificates to promote electricity generation from wind,2007,74.0,"This article uses computer simulation to anticipate the price dynamics in a market for Tradable Green Certificates (TGCs). These markets have been used in Europe to promote generation of electricity from renewable resources like wind. Similar markets have been proposed in the United States of America (USA) where the certificates are called Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). The certificates are issued to the generating companies for each megawatt-hour of renewable electricity generation. The companies may sell the certificates in a market, and the revenues from certificate sales provide an extra incentive to invest in new generating capacity. Proponents argue that this market-based incentive can be designed to support government mandates for a growing fraction of electricity generation from renewable sources. In the USA, these mandates are set by the states and are known as Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). We simulate the price dynamics of a market designed to support an aggressive mandate for wind generation in the northwestern USA. The simulations show that the certificate price climbs rapidly to the cap in the early years after the market opens. Investors then react to these high prices with construction of new wind capacity. After a few years, wind generation meets, and then exceeds the requirement. We show that this pattern appears again and again when the simulations are repeated with wide variations in the estimates of behavioral parameters. We use the model to study the impact of different trading strategies by the wind companies and by the distribution companies. We also study the simulated market response if the USA adopts the carbon allowance market envisioned in The Climate Stewardship Act. The article concludes with recommendations for policy makers involved in TGC market design. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Gao W., Darvishan A., Toghani M., Mohammadi M., Abedinia O., Ghadimi N.",Different states of multi-block based forecast engine for price and load prediction,2019,71.0,"This work proposes different prediction models based on multi-block forecast engine for load and price forecast in electricity market. Due to high correlation of load and price signals, the density of this reaction can affect the demand curve and shift it in market. Furthermore, to improve the operation and planning improvement in the power system, an accurate prediction model can play an important role. So, in this paper, a complex prediction approach is presented based on feature selection, and multi-stage forecast engine. The forecast engine is comprised of multi-block neural network (NN) and optimized by an intelligent algorithm to increase the training mechanism and forecasting abilities. Moreover, different models of multi-block forecast engine are presented in this paper to choose the effective model. In other words, different combinations of NN are tested in the same prediction condition to show their abilities. The proposed model is tested over real-world engineering test cases through comparison with other prediction methods. Obtained results demonstrate the validity of the proposed model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Feature selection; Intelligent algorithm; Load and price; Multi-block forecast engine,Commerce; Costs; Engines; Feature extraction; Accurate prediction; Engineering tests; Forecasting ability; Intelligent Algorithms; Multi blocks; Neural network (nn); Prediction methods; Prediction model; Forecasting,Article

"Lopez-Lezama J.M., Padilha-Feltrin A., Contreras J., Muñoz J.I.",Optimal contract pricing of distributed generation in distribution networks,2011,70.0,"This paper proposes a bilevel programming approach to determine the optimal contract price of dispatchable distributed generation (DG) units in distribution systems. Two different agents are considered in the model, namely, the distribution company (DisCo) and the owner of the DG. The former seeks the minimization of the payments incurred in attending the forecasted demand, while the latter seeks the maximization of his profit. To meet the expected demand, the DisCo has the option to purchase energy from any DG unit within its network and directly from the wholesale electricity market. A traditional distribution utility model with no competition among DG units is considered. The proposed model positions the DG owner in the outer optimization level and the DisCo in the inner one. This last optimization problem is substituted by its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, turning the bilevel programming problem into an equivalent single-level nonlinear programming problem which is solved using commercially available software. Tests are performed in a modified IEEE 34-bus distribution network. © 2010 IEEE.",Bilevel programming; distributed generation; distribution networks,Bi-level programming; Bilevel programming problem; DG unit; Distributed Generation; Distributed generation units; Distribution companies; Distribution network; Distribution systems; Distribution utilities; Karush kuhn tuckers; Nonlinear programming problem; Optimal contract; Optimality conditions; Optimization levels; Optimization problems; Wholesale electricity markets; Distributed parameter networks; Electric load forecasting; Galerkin methods; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Profitability; Distributed computer systems,Article
"Olsson M., Söder L.",Modeling real-time balancing power market prices using combined SARIMA and Markov processes,2008,70.0,This paper describes modeling of real-time balancing power market prices by using combined seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and discrete Markov processes. The combination of such processes allows generation of price series with periods where no demand for balancing power exists. The purpose of the model is simulation of prices to construct scenario trees representing possible realization of the stochastic prices. Such scenario trees can be used in planning models based on stochastic optimization to generate bid sequences to the balancing market. The spread of the prices in the tree and the shape of the scenarios are of central importance. Model parameter estimation methods reflecting the demands on scenario trees have therefore been used. The proposed model is also applied to data from the Nordic power market. The conclusion of this paper is that the developed model is appropriate for modeling real-time balancing power prices. © 2008 IEEE.,Markov processes; Power prices; SARIMA processes; Scenario generation; Time series analysis,Marketing; Markov processes; Operating costs; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Trees (mathematics); Power prices; Scenario generation; Seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average; Electric power systems,Article

"Gianfreda A., Grossi L.",Forecasting Italian electricity zonal prices with exogenous variables,2012,69.0,"In the last few years we have observed the deregulation in electricity markets and an increasing interest in price dynamics has been developed especially to consider all stylized facts shown by spot prices. Only few papers have considered the Italian Electricity Spot market since it has been deregulated recently. Therefore, this contribution is an investigation with emphasis on price dynamics accounting for technologies, market concentration, congestions and volumes. We aim to understand how these four variables affect zonal prices since these ones combine to bring about the single national price (prezzo unico d'acquisto, PUN). Hence, understanding its features is important for drawing policy indications referred to production planning and selection of generation sources, pricing and risk-hedging problems, monitoring of market power positions and finally to motivate investment strategies in new power plants and grid interconnections.

"Cruz A., Muñoz A., Zamora J.L., Espínola R.",The effect of wind generation and weekday on Spanish electricity spot price forecasting,2011,69.0,"This paper empirically compares the predictive accuracy of a set of methods for day-ahead spot price forecasting in the Spanish electricity market. The methods come from time series analysis and artificial intelligence disciplines, and include univariate, multivariate, linear and nonlinear. Within the univariate methods, the double seasonal ARIMA and the recently proposed exponential smoothing for double seasonality are compared and used as benchmarks. They allow us to quantify the improvement on price forecasting when including explanatory variables or using more complex models. Dynamic regression models including the electricity load forecast are then considered. Their good performance in price forecasting has been pointed out by many authors. However, we find evidences of their predictive accuracy can be significantly outperformed by accounting the wind generation forecast provided by the System Operator. Moreover, these forecasts can be even more accurate if changes of price's behavior according with the day of the week are taken into account by means of periodic models. The last of the tested methods are feed-forward neural networks used as multivariate nonlinear regression methods with universal function approximation capabilities. The influence of the wind generation forecast on price prediction is also proved with this approach. Detailed out-of-sample results of the tested methods are given. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Centolella P.,The integration of Price Responsive Demand into Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) wholesale power markets and system operations,2010,68.0,"A number of states and utilities are pursuing demand response based on dynamic and time-differentiated retail prices and utility investments in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), often as part of Smart Grid initiatives. These developments could produce large amounts of Price Responsive Demand, demand that predictably responds to changes in wholesale prices. Price Responsive Demand could provide significant reliability and economic benefits. However, existing RTO tariffs present potential barriers to the development of Price Responsive Demand. Effectively integrating Price Responsive Demand into RTO markets and operations will require changes in demand forecasting, scarcity pricing reform, synchronization of scarcity pricing with capacity markets, tracking voluntary hedging by price responsive loads, and a non-discriminatory approach in curtailments in capacity emergencies.

"Guo J.-J., Luh P.B.",Selecting input factors for clusters of Gaussian radial basis function networks to improve market clearing price prediction,2003,68.0,"In a deregulated power market, bidding decisions rely on good market clearing price prediction. One of the common forecasting methods is Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF) networks that approximate input-output relationships by building localized Gaussian functions (clusters). Currently, a cluster uses all the input factors. Certain input factors, however, may not be significant and should be deleted because they mislead local learning and result in poor predictions. Existing pruning methods for neural networks examine the significance of connections between neurons, and are not applicable to deleting center and standard deviation parameters in a GRBF network since those parameters bear no sense of significance of connection. In this paper, the inverses of standard deviations are found to capture a sense of connection, and based on this finding, a new training method to identify and eliminate unimportant input factors is developed.

The first question is timely and relevant because if the merit-order effect estimates are small, California's renewable energy development is of limited help in cutting electricity consumers' bills but also has a lesser adverse impact on the state's investment incentive for natural-gas-fired generation. The second question is related to the efficient market hypothesis under which the hourly RTM and DAM prices tend to converge. Using a sample of about 21,000 hourly observations of CAISO market prices and their fundamental drivers during 12/12/2012-04/30/2015, we document statistically significant estimates (p-value≤0.01) for the DAM and RTM merit-order effects. This finding lends support to California's adopted procurement process to provide sufficient investment incentives for natural-gas-fired generation. We document that the RTM-DAM price divergence partly depends on the CASIO's day-ahead forecast errors for system loads and renewable energy. This finding suggests that improving the performance of the CAISO's day-ahead forecasts can enhance trading efficiency in California's DAM and RTM electricity markets. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",California; Day-ahead market; Electricity prices; Merit-order effects; Real-time market; Renewable energy,Commerce; Costs; Dams; Electric utilities; Investments; Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; California; Day ahead market; Electricity prices; Ordering effects; Real-time market; Renewable energies; Power markets; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; energy policy; price dynamics; renewable resource; California; United States,Article
"Nowotarski J., Raviv E., Trück S., Weron R.",An empirical comparison of alternative schemes for combining electricity spot price forecasts,2014,65.0,"In this comprehensive empirical study we critically evaluate the use of forecast averaging in the context of electricity prices. We apply seven averaging and one selection scheme and perform a backtesting analysis on day-ahead electricity prices in three major European and US markets. Our findings support the additional benefit of combining forecasts of individual methods for deriving more accurate predictions, however, the performance is not uniform across the considered markets and periods. In particular, equally weighted pooling of forecasts emerges as a simple, yet powerful technique compared with other schemes that rely on estimated combination weights, but only when there is no individual predictor that consistently outperforms its competitors. Constrained least squares regression (CLS) offers a balance between robustness against such well performing individual methods and relatively accurate forecasts, on average better than those of the individual predictors. Finally, some popular forecast averaging schemes - like ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) - turn out to be unsuitable for predicting day-ahead electricity prices. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",ARX model; Constrained least squares regression; Day-ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combination,Bayesian networks; Commerce; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Least squares approximations; Regression analysis; ARX model; Constrained least squares; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combinations; Forecasting; Bayesian analysis; electricity supply; forecasting method; least squares method; market conditions; price determination; regression analysis; Europe; United States,Article

The proposed GA determines both the location and contract pricing of the DG units that would render maximum profits to the DG owner, subject to the minimization of payments procured by the DisCo. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, several tests were carried out on a modified IEEE 34-bus and 85-bus distribution networks. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Finn P., Fitzpatrick C., Connolly D., Leahy M., Relihan L.",Facilitation of renewable electricity using price based appliance control in Ireland's electricity market,2011,65.0,"Abstract Ireland's share of electricity generated from RES-E (renewable energy sources) is due to increase from 14.4% in 2009 to 40% in 2020. With this target predominantly fulfilled with wind generated electricity, the need for increased grid flexibility to facilitate this intermittent energy source is becoming ever more significant. As smart metering becomes available, demand side participation will be one option for achieving this flexibility. Using an immersion heated hot water tank as an example, this paper examines the impact that price optimised load scheduling has on the facilitation of wind generated electricity. To replicate real-world data availability, optimisation is performed using day-ahead predicted prices while the results are calculated using final prices and metered generation data. The results demonstrate a correlation between the day-ahead predicted half-hourly price of electricity and real-time wind availability. This supports the use of price as a means of providing an incentive for load response in order to increase the amount of renewable energy that can be facilitated on the electrical grid. Furthermore, various thermal storage efficiencies were examined for the device to reveal that as the energy loss rate of the device is reduced, the financial savings increase, wind generation increases, and conventional generation decreases. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Demand side management; Real-time pricing; Wind energy,Costs; Electricity; Energy dissipation; Heat storage; Water tanks; Wind power; Appliance controls; Conventional generation; Demand side managements; Demand-side; Electrical grids; Electricity market; Energy-loss rate; Financial savings; Hot water tanks; Hourly prices; Intermittent energy source; Ireland; Load response; Load scheduling; Optimisations; Price-based; Real time pricing; Real world data; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Smart metering; Thermal storage; Wind energy; Wind generation; Electric generators; data assimilation; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy market; energy resource; optimization; renewable resource; wind power; Ireland,Article
"Redl C., Haas R., Huber C., Böhm B.",Price formation in electricity forward markets and the relevance of systematic forecast errors,2009,65.0,"Since the liberalisation of the European electricity sector, forward and futures contracts have gained significant interest of market participants due to risk management reasons. For pricing of these contracts an important fact concerns the non-storability of electricity. In this case, according to economic theory, forward prices are related to the expected spot prices which are built on fundamental market expectations. In the following article the crucial impact parameters of forward electricity prices and the relationship between forward and future spot prices will be assessed by an empirical analysis of electricity prices at the European Energy Exchange and the Nord Pool Power Exchange. In fact, price formation in the considered markets is influenced by historic spot market prices yielding a biased forecasting power of long-term contracts. Although market and risk assessment measures of market participants and supply and demand shocks can partly explain the futures-spot bias inefficiencies in the analysed forward markets cannot be ruled out. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We extend the Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) approach of Nowotarski and Weron (2014a), and use principal component analysis to automate the process of selecting from among a large set of individual forecasting models that are available for averaging. We show that the resulting Factor Quantile Regression Averaging (FQRA) approach performs very well for price (and load) data from the British power market.

A reliable price prediction model based on an advanced self-adaptive radial basis function (RBF) neural network is presented. The proposed RBF neural network model is trained by fuzzy c-means and differential evolution is used to auto-configure the structure of networks and obtain the model parameters. With these techniques, the number of neurons, cluster centres and radii of the hidden layer, and the output weights can be automatically calculated efficiently. Meanwhile, the moving window wavelet de-noising technique is introduced to improve the network performance as well.

Lahmiri S.,Comparing variational and empirical mode decomposition in forecasting day-ahead energy prices,2017,62.0,"Recently, variational mode decomposition (VMD) has been proposed as an advanced multiresolution technique for signal processing. This study presents a VMD-based generalized regression neural network ensemble learning model to predict California electricity and Brent crude oil prices. Its performance is compared to that of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based generalized regression neural network (GRNN) ensemble model. Particle swarm optimization is used to optimize each GRNN initial weight within the ensemble system. Experimental results showed that the VMD-based ensemble outperformed EMD-based ensemble forecasting system in terms of mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean-squared error. It also outperformed the conventional auto-regressive moving average model used for comparison purpose. As a result, the VMD-based GRNN ensemble forecasting paradigm could be a promising methodology for California electricity and Brent crude oil price prediction. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); energy price; ensemble system; forecasting; generalized regression neural network; variational mode decomposition (VMD),Costs; Crude oil; Errors; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Regression analysis; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Energy prices; Ensemble systems; Generalized regression neural networks; Mode decomposition; Signal processing,Article
"Shayeghi H., Ghasemi A., Moradzadeh M., Nooshyar M.",Simultaneous day-ahead forecasting of electricity price and load in smart grids,2015,62.0,"In smart grids, customers are promoted to change their energy consumption patterns by electricity prices. In fact, in this environment, the electricity price and load consumption are highly corrected such that the market participants will have complex model in their decisions to maximize their profit. Although the available forecasting mythologies perform well in electricity market by way of little or no load and price interdependencies, but cannot capture load and price dynamics if they exist. To overcome this shortage, a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model is presented which can consider the correlation between electricity price and load. The proposed model consists of three components known as a Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) to make valuable subsets, Generalized Mutual Information (GMI) to select best input candidate and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) based on MIMO model, called LSSVM-MIMO, to make simultaneous load and price forecasts. Moreover, the LSSVM-MIMO parameters are optimized by a novel Quasi-Oppositional Artificial Bee Colony (QOABC) algorithm. Some forecasting indices based on error factor are considered to evaluate the forecasting accuracy.

"Andalib A., Atry F.","Multi-step ahead forecasts for electricity prices using NARX: A new approach, a critical analysis of one-step ahead forecasts",2009,62.0,"The prediction of electricity prices is very important to participants of deregulated markets. Among many properties, a successful prediction tool should be able to capture long-term dependencies in market's historical data. A nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (NARX) has proven to enjoy a superior performance to capture such dependencies than other learning machines. However, it is not examined for electricity price forecasting so far. In this paper, we have employed a NARX network for forecasting electricity prices. Our prediction model is then compared with two currently used methods, namely the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and wavelet neural network. All the models are built on the reconstructed state space of market's historical data, which either improves the results or decreases the complexity of learning algorithms. Here, we also criticize the one-step ahead forecasts for electricity price that may suffer a one-term delay and we explain why the mean square error criterion does not guarantee a functional prediction result in this case. To tackle the problem, we pursue multi-step ahead predictions. Results for the Ontario electricity market are presented. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Rafiei M., Niknam T., Khooban M.-H.",Probabilistic Forecasting of Hourly Electricity Price by Generalization of ELM for Usage in Improved Wavelet Neural Network,2017,61.0,"In restructured markets where transactions process is competitive, forecasting of electricity price is inevitably an important available tool for market participants. Due to the sensitivity of forecasting issues in market's performance, and high prediction error resulted from the behavior of price series, nowadays probabilistic forecasting highly attracted participants' attention. In this paper, a probabilistic approach for the hourly electricity price forecasting is presented. In the proposed method, the uncertainty of predictor model is considered as the uncertainty factor. The bootstrapping technique is used to implement the uncertainty and since the method is needed to be fast and of low computational cost in the daily forecasting, a generalized learning method is applied, which has high accuracy and speed. This newly presented learning method is based on generalized extreme learning machine approach to be used for improved wavelet neural networks. Also in order to reach more accommodation, the predictor model with the changes of price time series, the wavelet preprocessing is used. Effective performance of the proposed model is validated by testing on data of Ontario and Australian electricity markets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Bootstrapping; generalized extreme learning machine (GELM); probabilistic forecasting; wavelet neural networks (WNNs); wavelet preprocessing,Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Power markets; Power transformers; Statistical methods; Bootstrapping; Extreme learning machine; Probabilistic forecasting; Wavelet neural networks; Wavelet pre-processing; Learning systems,Article

The context is the UK market, after the reforms introduced in March 2001, analysed with an original set of price drivers reflecting economic, technical, strategic, risk, behavioural and market design effects. Models are estimated separately as daily time-series of the 48 half-hourly trading periods. All coefficients exhibit substantial intra-day variation, relating to the heterogeneity of operating plants and market design aspects. This reveals a market responding to economic fundamentals and plant operating properties, with learning and emergent financial characteristics, as well as some strategic manipulation of capacity, most effectively exercised by the more flexible plants. Using regime-switching parameters, the effects of capacity margin and inter-day capacity adjustment are elucidated, suggesting rent-seeking behaviour, despite the relatively low prices at the time. Overall, high-frequency, aggregate fundamental price models can usefully uncover critical aspects of market performance, evolution and agent behaviour. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

"Wang L., Zhang Z., Chen J.",Short-Term Electricity Price Forecasting with Stacked Denoising Autoencoders,2017,60.0,"A short-term forecasting of the electricity price with data-driven algorithms is studied in this research. A stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA) model, a class of deep neural networks, and its extended version are utilized to forecast the electricity price hourly. Data collected in Nebraska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Indiana hubs in U.S. are utilized. Two types of forecasting, the online hourly forecasting and day-ahead hourly forecasting, are examined. In online forecasting, SDA models are compared with data-driven approaches including the classical neural networks, support vector machine, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. In the day-ahead forecasting, the effectiveness of SDA models is further validated through comparing with industrial results and a recently reported method. Computational results demonstrate that SDA models are capable to accurately forecast electricity prices and the extended SDA model further improves the forecasting performance. © 2016 IEEE.",Comparative analysis; data mining; electricity price; hourly forecasting; neural networks,Costs; Data mining; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Neural networks; Power markets; Classical neural networks; Comparative analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting performance; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Short-term forecasting; Forecasting,Article

"Dong Y., Wang J., Jiang H., Wu J.",Short-term electricity price forecast based on the improved hybrid model,2011,60.0,"Half-hourly electricity price in power system are volatile, electricity price forecast is significant information which can help market managers and participants involved in electricity market to prepare their corresponding bidding strategies to maximize their benefits and utilities. However, the fluctuation of electricity price depends on the common effect of many factors and there is a very complicated random in its evolution process. Therefore, it is difficult to forecast half-hourly prices with traditional only one model for different behaviors of half-hourly prices. This paper proposes the improved forecasting model that detaches high volatility and daily seasonality for electricity price of New South Wales in Australia based on Empirical Mode Decomposition, Seasonal Adjustment and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. The prediction errors are analyzed and compared with the ones obtained from the traditional Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model.

"Amjady N., Hemmati M.",Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by a hybrid intelligent system,2009,60.0,"Price forecasting is so valuable for both producers and consumers in the new competitive electric power markets. In this paper, a new hybrid intelligent system (HIS) is proposed for day-ahead prediction of market clearing price (MCP) in the pool-based markets. MCP has a volatile and time-dependent behavior owning many outliers. Prediction of such a complex signal is a challenging task requiring a qualified forecast tool, which not only fits well to the training data, but also can predict the stochastic behavior of the unseen part of the signal. The proposed hybrid system is composed of a real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA), cross-validation, repetitive training, and archiving techniques combined in the framework of a neural network (NN). The proposed RCGA with enhanced stochastic search capability is used for training of the NN while the cross-validation, repetitive training and archiving techniques enhances generalization capability of it. The proposed forecast strategy is examined on the different periods of the Spanish electricity market. It is shown that the method can provide more accurate results than the other price forecasting techniques such as ARIMA time series, wavelet-ARIMA, fuzzy neural network (FNN), and generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) methods.

"Kiesel R., Paraschiv F.",Econometric analysis of 15-minute intraday electricity prices,2017,59.0,"The trading activity in the German intraday electricity market has increased significantly over the last years. This is partially due to an increasing share of renewable energy, wind and photovoltaic, which requires power generators to balance out the forecasting errors in their production. We investigate the bidding behaviour in the intraday market by looking at both last prices and continuous bidding, in the context of a reduced-form econometric analysis. A unique data set of 15-minute intraday prices and intraday-updated forecasts of wind and photovoltaic has been employed. Price bids are explained by prior information on renewables forecasts and demand/supply market-specific exogenous variables. We show that intraday prices adjust asymmetrically to both forecasting errors in renewables and to the volume of trades dependent on the threshold variable demand quote, which reflects the expected demand covered by the planned traditional capacity in the day-ahead market. The location of the threshold can be used by market participants to adjust their bids accordingly, given the latest updates in the wind and photovoltaic forecasting errors and the forecasts of the control area balances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bidding behavior; Intraday electricity prices; Renewable energies,Commerce; Costs; Errors; Bidding behavior; Demand/supply market; Econometric analysis; Electricity prices; Exogenous variables; Market participants; Prior information; Renewable energies; Forecasting; alternative energy; econometrics; electricity supply; photovoltaic system; price determination; wind power; Germany,Article
"Dillig M., Jung M., Karl J.",The impact of renewables on electricity prices in Germany - An estimation based on historic spot prices in the years 2011-2013,2016,59.0,Germanys public opinion and media usually attribute increasing electricity prices to the high share of renewables in the German power system. But average electricity prices at the European Energy Exchange dropped during the last years due to an excess of renewable energy. This study uses historic market data in order to quantify the effect of renewables on prices. Historic demand and supply curves from 2011 to 2013 have been used to reconstruct electricity prices under the assumption that no wind and PV would be available. The analysis reveals an astonishingly high increase of market prices up to 5.29 ct/kWh due to a lack of non-renewable power capacities. In 2013 the available conventional capacity would not have been able to cover the demand during 269 hours. The estimated maximum deficit of 5.6 GW is in good agreement to data published by the German grid operators. The discussion of the origin of this deficit leads to the conclusion that the current situation has not been caused by renewables. The liberalization of the European energy market established investment risks that hindered required investment a long time before the renewables boomed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.,Electricity market modeling; Energy economics; Generation capacity; Merit order effect; Renewable electricity,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Power markets; Social aspects; Electricity market model; Energy economics; Generation capacity; Ordering effects; Renewable electricity; Investments,Review
Chaâbane N.,A hybrid ARFIMA and neural network model for electricity price prediction,2014,59.0,"In the framework of competitive electricity market, prices forecasting has become a real challenge for all market participants. However, forecasting is a rather complex task since electricity prices involve many features comparably with those in financial markets. Electricity markets are more unpredictable than other commodities referred to as extreme volatile. Therefore, the choice of the forecasting model has become even more important. In this paper, a new hybrid model is proposed. This model exploits the feature and strength of the Auto-Regressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) model as well as the feedforward neural networks model. The expected prediction combination takes advantage of each model's strength or unique capability. The proposed model is examined by using data from the Nordpool electricity market.

"Pirrong C., Jermakyan M.",The price of power: The valuation of power and weather derivatives,2008,59.0,"Pricing contingent claims on power presents numerous challenges due to (1) the unique behavior of power prices, and (2) time-dependent variations in prices. We propose and implement a model in which the spot price of power is a function of two state variables: demand (load) and fuel price. In this model, any power derivative price must satisfy a PDE with boundary conditions that reflect capacity limits and the non-linear relation between load and the spot price of power. Moreover, since power is non-storable and demand is not a traded asset, the power derivative price embeds a market price of risk. Using inverse problem techniques and power forward prices from the PJM market, we solve for this market price of risk function. During 1999-2001, the upward bias in the forward price was as large as $50/MWh for some days in July. By 2005, the largest estimated upward bias had fallen to $19/MWh. These large biases are plausibly due to the extreme right skewness of power prices; this induces left skewness in the payoff to short forward positions, and a large risk premium is required to induce traders to sell power forwards. This risk premium suggests that the power market is not fully integrated with the broader financial markets. © 2008.",Derivatives pricing; Electricity markets; Inverse techniques; Market price of risk,,Article

"Li F., Bo R.",Congestion and price prediction under load variation,2009,56.0,"In market-based planning and operation, it is very useful to have the information of generation dispatch, congestion, and price as load increases. Therefore, it is beneficial to system planners if the congestion or locational marginal pricing (LMP) versus load is readily available. This can certainly be obtained by repetitively running an optimization model at different load levels. However, this approach is too brute-force to be practical. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is proposed to identify the new binding constraint and the new marginal unit set when the system load increases from the present load level. It addresses the challenge of step changes in generation dispatch when a generation or transmission limit becomes binding. The algorithm also gives the new sensitivity of the new marginal units. Therefore, the generation dispatch, congested lines, and LMP at a new critical load level (CLL) can be easily calculated. Test results are presented in matrix formulation to clearly demonstrate and verify the proposed algorithm. Since the proposed approach is based on linearized model, it should be particularly suitable for short-term planning or operation, although application to long-term planning is also possible. © 2009 IEEE.",Congestion management; Critical load level (CLL); Energy markets; Generation sensitivity; Locational marginal pricing (LMP); Optimal power flow (OPF); Power markets,Congestion management; Critical load level (CLL); Energy markets; Generation sensitivity; Locational marginal pricing (LMP); Optimal power flow (OPF); Power markets; Acoustic generators; Binding energy; Commerce; Costs; Electric load flow; Optimization; Power electronics; Loads (forces),Article

"Huang D., Zareipour H., Rosehart W.D., Amjady N.",Data mining for electricity price classification and the application to demand-side management,2012,55.0,"Forecasting electricity prices plays a significant role in making optimal scheduling decisions in competitive electricity markets. Predominantly, price forecasting is performed from a ""point forecasting"" perspective, i.e., forecasting the exact values of future prices. However, in some applications, such as demand-side management, operation decisions are made based on certain price thresholds. It is, hence, desirable to obtain the ""classes"" of future prices, which can be cast as an electricity price classification problem. In this paper, we investigate the application and effectiveness of several data mining approaches for electricity market price classification. In addition, we propose a new data model for forming the initial data set for price classification. Simulation results for New York, Ontario, and Alberta electricity market prices are provided.

"Kuo P.-H., Huang C.-J.",An electricity price forecasting model by hybrid structured deep neural networks,2018,54.0,"Electricity price is a key influencer in the electricity market. Electricity market trades by each participant are based on electricity price. The electricity price adjusted with the change in supply and demand relationship can reflect the real value of electricity in the transaction process. However, for the power generating party, bidding strategy determines the level of profit, and the accurate prediction of electricity price could make it possible to determine a more accurate bidding price. This cannot only reduce transaction risk, but also seize opportunities in the electricity market. In order to effectively estimate electricity price, this paper proposes an electricity price forecasting system based on the combination of 2 deep neural networks, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). In order to compare the overall performance of each algorithm, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root-Mean-Square error (RMSE) evaluating measures were applied in the experiments of this paper.

Different scenarios in terms of wind penetration, wind forecasts, and wind curtailment are modeled in order to analyze the impact of wind power on electricity prices for different wind penetration levels and for different levels of wind power visibility and controllability. The analysis concludes that electricity price volatility increases even as electricity prices decrease with increasing wind penetration levels. The impact of wind power on price volatility is larger in the shorter term (5-min compared to hour-to-hour). The results presented show that over-forecasting wind power increases electricity prices while under-forecasting wind power reduces them. The modeling results also show that controlling wind power by allowing curtailment increases electricity prices, and for higher wind penetrations it also reduces their volatility. © 2016.",Electricity price; Production cost modeling; Wind forecasting; Wind power; Wind power curtailment,Costs; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Power control; Wind power; Electricity price volatilities; Electricity prices; Independent system operators; Production cost model; Wind forecasting; Wind penetration; Wind penetration levels; Wind power curtailments; Weather forecasting; cost analysis; electricity; numerical model; production cost; wind power; New England; United States,Article

"Qiao W., Yang Z.",Forecast the electricity price of U.S. using a wavelet transform-based hybrid model,2020,53.0,"Wavelet transform (WT), as a data preprocessing algorithm, has been widely applied in electricity price forecasting. However, this deterministic-based algorithm does not present stable performance owing to the experiential selection of its orders and layers. For determining the selection of WT's orders and layers in U.S. electricity prices forecasting, this paper designs a crossover experiment with 240 schemes of WT parameter selection and forecasts each scheme with stacked autoencoder (SAE) and long short-term memory (LSTM), generating a novel hybrid model WT-SAE-LSTM. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other AI models, such as back propagation neural network et al., in forecasting accuracy. The best performance of WT-SAE-LSTM in residential, commercial, and industrial electricity price cases obtained by five order four layers, five order four layers, and four order seven layers, where the MAPE is 0.8606%, 0.4719%, and 0.4956%, respectively. Additionally, the difference between the proposed forecasting model and the forecasting result of Energy Information Administration (U.S.) is small. This paper determines the optimal orders and layers of WT in U.S. electricity prices forecasting, which provides an effective reference for the application of WT in other forecasting scenarios and for electricity market participants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price; Energy information administration; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Stacked autoencoder; Wavelet transform,Backpropagation; Brain; Costs; Forecasting; Power markets; Wavelet transforms; Auto encoders; Back propagation neural networks; Crossover experiments; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity prices forecasting; Energy Information Administration; Forecasting accuracy; Long short-term memory; algorithm; back propagation; electricity; energy market; equipment; forecasting method; numerical model; price dynamics; wavelet analysis; United States,Article

Combining the Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) and Orthogonal Experimental Design (OED), an Enhanced Radial Basis Function Network (ERBFN) has been proposed for the solving process. The Locational Marginal Price (LMP), system load, transmission flow and temperature of the PJM system were collected and the data clusters were embedded in the Excel Database according to the year, season, workday and weekend. With the OED applied to learning rates in the ERBFN, the forecasting error can be reduced during the training process to improve both accuracy and reliability. This would mean that even the ""spikes"" could be tracked closely. The Back-propagation Neural Network (BPN), Probability Neural Network (PNN), other algorithms, and the proposed ERBFN were all developed and compared to check the performance. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed ERBFN to provide quality information in a price volatile environment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Alamaniotis M., Bargiotas D., Bourbakis N.G., Tsoukalas L.H.",Genetic Optimal Regression of Relevance Vector Machines for Electricity Pricing Signal Forecasting in Smart Grids,2015,52.0,"Price-directed demand in smart grids operating within deregulated electricity markets calls for real-time forecasting of the price of electricity for the purpose of scheduling demand at the nodal level (e.g., appliances, machines, and devices) in a way that minimizes energy cost to the consumer. In this paper, a novel hybrid methodology for electricity price forecasting is introduced and applied on a set of real-world historical data taken from the New England area. The proposed approach is implemented in two steps. In the first step, a set of relevance vector machines (RVMs) is adopted, where each RVM is used for individual ahead-of-time price prediction. In the second step, individual predictions are aggregated to formulate a linear regression ensemble, whose coefficients are obtained as the solution of a single objective optimization problem. Thus, an optimal solution to the problem is found by employing the micro-genetic algorithm and the optimized ensemble is employed for computing the final price forecast. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with performance of autoregressive-moving-average and naïve forecasting methods, as well as to that taken from each individual RVM. Results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid methodology over the other tested methods with regard to mean absolute error for electricity signal pricing forecasting. © 2015 IEEE.",Autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA); electricity price forecasting; genetic algorithms; price-directed smart grid; relevance vector machines (RVMs),Costs; Deregulation; Electric load forecasting; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Scheduling; Autoregressive moving average; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Individual prediction; Micro genetic algorithm; Real-time forecasting; Relevance Vector Machine; Single objective optimization problems; Smart power grids,Article
"Nojavan S., Mohammadi-Ivatloo B., Zare K.",Robust optimization based price-taker retailer bidding strategy under pool market price uncertainty,2015,52.0,"In the restructured electricity markets, retailers purchase the required demand of its consumers from different energy resources such as self-generating facilities, bilateral contracts and pool market. In this process, the pool market price uncertainty modeling is important for obtaining the maximum profit. Therefore, in this paper, a robust optimization approach is proposed to obtain the optimal bidding strategy of retailer, which should be submitted to pool market. By the proposed method, a collection of robust mixed-integer linear programming problem (RMILP) is solved to build optimal bidding strategy for retailer. For pool market price uncertainty modeling, upper and lower limits of pool prices are considered instead of the forecasted prices. The range of pool prices are sequentially partitioned into a successive of nested subintervals, which permit formulating a collection of RMILP problems. The results of these problems give sufficient data to obtain optimal bidding strategy for submit to pool market by retailer.

Kristiansen T.,Forecasting Nord Pool day-ahead prices with an autoregressive model,2012,52.0,"This paper presents a model to forecast Nord Pool hourly day-ahead prices. The model is based on Weron and Misiorek (2008) but reduced in terms of estimation parameters (from 24 sets to 1) and modified to include Nordic demand and Danish wind power as exogenous variables. We model prices across all hours in the analysis period rather than across each single hour of 24. hours. By applying three model variants on Nord Pool data, we achieve a weekly mean absolute percentage error (WMAE) of around 6-7% and an hourly mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranging from 8% to 11%. Out of sample results yields a WMAE and an hourly MAPE of around 5%. The models enable analysts and traders to forecast hourly day-ahead prices accurately. Moreover, the models are relatively straightforward and user-friendly to implement.

"Amjady N., Daraeepour A.",Design of input vector for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets,2009,52.0,"In new deregulated electricity market, price forecasts have become a fundamental input to an energy company's decision making and strategy development process. However, the exclusive characteristics of electricity price such as non-stationarity, non-linearity and time-varying volatile structure present a number of challenges for this task. In spite of all performed research on this area in the recent years, there is still essential need for more accurate and robust price forecast methods. Besides, there is a lack of efficient feature selection technique for designing the input vector of electricity price forecast. In this paper, a new two-stage feature selection algorithm composed of modified relief and mutual information (MI) techniques is proposed for this purpose. Moreover, cascaded neural network (CNN) is presented as forecast engine for electricity price prediction. The CNN is composed of cascaded forecasters where each forecaster is a neural network (NN). The proposed feature selection algorithm selects the best set of candidate inputs which is used by the CNN. The proposed method is examined on PJM, Spanish and Ontario electricity markets and compared with some of the most recent price forecast techniques. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Wang F., Li K., Zhou L., Ren H., Contreras J., Shafie-khah M., Catalão J.P.S.",Daily pattern prediction based classification modeling approach for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2019,51.0,"Day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) plays a very important role in the decision-making optimization of electricity market participants, the dispatch control of independent system operators (ISOs) and the strategy formulation of energy trading. Unified modeling that only fits a single mapping relation between the historical data and future data usually produces larger errors because the different fluctuation patterns in electricity price data show different mapping relations. A daily pattern prediction (DPP) based classification modeling approach for DAEPF is proposed to solve this problem. The basic idea is that first recognize the price pattern of the next day from the “rough” day-ahead forecasting results provided by conventional forecasting methods and then perform classification modeling to further improve the forecasting accuracy through building a specific forecasting model for each pattern. The proposed approach consists of four steps. First, K-means is utilized to group all the historical daily electricity price curves into several clusters in order to assign each daily curve a pattern label for the training of the following daily pattern recognition (DPR) model and classification modeling. Second, a DPP model is proposed to recognize the price pattern of the next day from the forecasting results provided by multiple conventional forecasting methods. A weighted voting mechanism (WVM) method is proposed in this step to combine multiple day-ahead pattern predictions to obtain a more accurate DPP result. Third, the classification forecasting model of each different daily pattern can be established according to the clustering results in step 1. Fourth, the credibility of DPP result is checked to eventually determine whether the proposed classification DAEPF modeling approach can be adopted or not. A case study using the real electricity price data from the PJM market indicates that the proposed approach presents a better performance than unified modeling for a certain daily pattern whose DPP results show high reliability and accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Classification modeling; Daily pattern prediction; Day-ahead forecasting; Electricity price; Weighted voting mechanism,Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Decision making; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Mapping; Pattern recognition; Classification models; Day-ahead; Decision-making optimization; Different mapping relation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Independent system operators; Weighted voting; Power markets,Article

It is an aggregate that equals the average of hourly prices for delivery during each of the 24 individual hours. This paper demonstrates that the disaggregated hourly prices contain useful predictive information for the daily average price in the Nord Pool market. Multivariate models for the full panel of hourly prices significantly outperform univariate models of the daily average price, with reductions in Root Mean Squared Error of up to 16%. Substantial care is required in order to achieve these forecast improvements.

By estimating a Markov regime-switching model, we find that the relation between the EUA price and its fundamentals varies over time. In particular, we are able to identify a low and a high volatility regime, both showing a strong impact of the fundamentals on the EUA price. The most important EUA price drivers are changes on the stock market and energy prices. The gas price and a broad European equity index affect the EUA price positively in both regimes, while the coal price and the oil price have a significant, but also positive impact only during the high and the low volatility regime, respectively. The high volatility regime is predominant in phases when economic activities are on a decrease or when institutional changes harm the confidence in the stringency of the EU ETS.

"Christensen T.M., Hurn A.S., Lindsay K.A.",Forecasting spikes in electricity prices,2012,51.0,"In many electricity markets, retailers purchase electricity at an unregulated spot price and sell to consumers at a heavily regulated price. Consequently, the occurrence of spikes in the spot electricity price represents a major source of risk for retailers, and the forecasting of these price spikes is important for effective risk management. Traditional approaches to modelling electricity prices have aimed to predict the trajectory of spot prices. In contrast, this paper focuses on the prediction of price spikes. The time series of price spikes is treated as a discrete-time point process, and a nonlinear variant of the autoregressive conditional hazard model is used to model this process. The model is estimated using half-hourly data from the Australian electricity market for the period 1 March 2001 to 30 June 2007. One-step-ahead forecasts of the probability of a price spike are then generated for each half hour in the forecast period, 1 July 2007 to 30 September 2007. The forecasting performance of the model is then evaluated against a benchmark that is consistent with the assumptions of commonly-used electricity pricing models. © 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.",Autoregressive conditional duration; Autoregressive conditional hazard; Electricity futures; Electricity prices; Price spikes,,Article

"Yang W., Wang J., Niu T., Du P.",A hybrid forecasting system based on a dual decomposition strategy and multi-objective optimization for electricity price forecasting,2019,50.0,"Electricity price forecasting plays a crucial role in balancing electricity generation and consumption, which is of great political and economic significance for all of society but is still a challenging task. However, in previous studies, most researchers have focused on improving either forecasting accuracy or stability while ignoring the significance of performing these tasks simultaneously. More importantly, few researchers have deeply studied the data preprocessing strategy, only focusing on the application of individual decomposition approaches. Therefore, a novel hybrid forecasting system based on a dual decomposition strategy and multi-objective optimization is developed for electricity price forecasting that includes four modules: a data preprocessing module, optimization module, forecasting module and evaluation module. In this system, an effective multi-objective optimization algorithm is employed to guarantee simultaneous improvements in accuracy and stability. In addition, an improved data preprocessing approach named the dual decomposition strategy is developed, which successfully overcomes the potential drawback of the individual decomposition approach and further improves the effectiveness of the developed forecasting system. Moreover, the evaluation module is incorporated to verify the superiority of the developed forecasting system. Case studies utilizing half-hourly electricity price data collected from New South Wales, Australia are employed as examples. The results prove the superiority of the multi-objective optimization algorithm and the developed dual decomposition strategy and reveal that the developed forecasting system outperforms all of the considered comparison models, which shows its better ability to forecast future electricity prices with better accuracy and stability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Dual decomposition strategy; Electricity price forecasting system; Forecasting accuracy and stability; Multi-objective optimization algorithm,"Forecasting; Power markets; System stability; Data preprocessing; Decomposition approach; Dual decomposition; Electricity generation; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; New South Wales , Australia; Optimization module; Multiobjective optimization; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data processing; decomposition analysis; electricity; electricity generation; forecasting method; optimization; price dynamics; Australia; New South Wales",Article

We provide evidence that despite a minor edge in predictive performance overall, the multivariate modeling framework does not uniformly outperform the univariate one across all 12 considered datasets, seasons of the year or hours of the day, and at times is outperformed by the latter. This is an indication that combining advanced structures or the corresponding forecasts from both modeling approaches can bring a further improvement in forecasting accuracy. We show that this indeed can be the case, even for a simple averaging scheme involving only two models.

"Rider M.J., Paucar V.L.",Application of a nonlinear reactive power pricing model for competitive electric markets,2004,50.0,"A methodology for calculating active and reactive power marginal prices is proposed. Attention is given to the reactive power marginal price in a competitive electric market. The formulation adopts a synchronous generators steady-state model with nonlinear reactive power limits. Total cost of reactive power production (CRPP) is represented as a nonlinear model that considers the corresponding economic loss if active power is not generated; that cost is the opportunity cost.

"Ni E., Luh P.B.",Forecasting power market clearing price and its discrete PDF using a Bayesian-based classification method,2001,49.0,"Neural network methods have been successfully used for various applications. In time series prediction problems, the regression models such as multiple layer perceptron (MLP) and the radial basis function network (RBF) are usually applied. However, they cannot predict the probability density function (PDF) that is critical for some applications. When there is noise or corrupt data in the process, these regression models could be misled, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. In this paper, a classification method combined with a simple regression model is presented to predict the discrete PDF of power market clearing prices, which is critical for many decision-makings such as optimizing bidding strategies, and is very difficult to predict because of high market uncertainties. Our basic idea is to form a number of classes by discretizing the variable to be predicted, and thus converts the time series prediction problem into a pattern classification problem. The classes are clustered based on historical data, and the input statistics (e.g., input mean and covariance matrix, etc.) corresponding to each class are obtained via clustering. Given a new input, these classes are sorted according to the posterior probabilities calculated by using the Bayes’ formula. The prediction is then generated by using an auto-regression method (AR) for the classes with high posterior probabilities. The classes are then updated after the actual output is available. The method developed can be seen as an RBF with variable structure. The posterior probabilities can be viewed as an approximation of the discrete PDF, providing valuable information for decision-makes and for what if analysis. The developed method has been used to predict the on-peak and off-peak average MCPs in the New England market. The testing results show that it outperforms the RBF network in terms of prediction accuracy and computational time.",Auto-regression; Bayes’ rule; Classification; Deregulated electric power markets; MCP prediction,Decision support systems; Electric power systems; Marketing; Multilayer neural networks; Probability density function; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Uncertain systems; Bayesian classification method; Power market clearing price; Regression model; Electric load forecasting,Article

We discuss in detail the estimation results which provide insights to the intraday behavior of electricity prices.

We consider a battery of over 300 models, including monthly dummies and models based on Fourier or wavelet decomposition combined with linear or exponential decay. We find that the considered wavelet-based models are significantly better in terms of forecasting spot prices up to a year ahead than the commonly used monthly dummies and sine-based models. This result questions the validity and usefulness of stochastic models of spot electricity prices built on the latter two types of LTSC models. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity spot price; Forecasting; Long-term seasonal component; Robust modeling; Wavelets,Electricity spot price; Exponential decays; Long-term seasonal component; Robust estimation; Robust modeling; Spot electricity prices; Spot price; Wavelets; Electricity spot price; Exponential decays; Long-term seasonal component; Robust estimation; Robust modeling; Spot electricity prices; Wavelet based models; Wavelets; Electricity; Forecasting; Wavelet decomposition; Costs; Forecasting; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Costs; Stochastic models; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy market; forecasting method; modeling; price dynamics; electricity; energy market; forecasting method; modeling; wavelet analysis,Article

"Amjady N., Daraeepour A.",Mixed price and load forecasting of electricity markets by a new iterative prediction method,2009,48.0,"Load and price forecasting are the two key issues for the participants of current electricity markets. However, load and price of electricity markets have complex characteristics such as nonlinearity, non-stationarity and multiple seasonality, to name a few (usually, more volatility is seen in the behavior of electricity price signal). For these reasons, much research has been devoted to load and price forecast, especially in the recent years. However, previous research works in the area separately predict load and price signals. In this paper, a mixed model for load and price forecasting is presented, which can consider interactions of these two forecast processes. The mixed model is based on an iterative neural network based prediction technique. It is shown that the proposed model can present lower forecast errors for both load and price compared with the previous separate frameworks. Another advantage of the mixed model is that all required forecast features (from load or price) are predicted within the model without assuming known values for these features. So, the proposed model can better be adapted to real conditions of an electricity market. The forecast accuracy of the proposed mixed method is evaluated by means of real data from the New York and Spanish electricity markets. The method is also compared with some of the most recent load and price forecast techniques. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Serinaldi F.,"Distributional modeling and short-term forecasting of electricity prices by Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape",2011,47.0,"In the context of the liberalized and deregulated electricity markets, price forecasting has become increasingly important for energy company's plans and market strategies. Within the class of the time series models that are used to perform price forecasting, the subclasses of methods based on stochastic time series and causal models commonly provide point forecasts, whereas the corresponding uncertainty is quantified by approximate or simulation-based confidence intervals. Aiming to improve the uncertainty assessment, this study introduces the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) to model the dynamically varying distribution of prices. The GAMLSS allow fitting a variety of distributions whose parameters change according to covariates via a number of linear and nonlinear relationships. In this way, price periodicities, trends and abrupt changes characterizing both the position parameter (linked to the expected value of prices), and the scale and shape parameters (related to price volatility, skewness, and kurtosis) can be explicitly incorporated in the model setup. Relying on the past behavior of the prices and exogenous variables, the GAMLSS enable the short-term (one-day ahead) forecast of the entire distribution of prices. The approach was tested on two datasets from the widely studied California Power Exchange (CalPX) market, and the less mature Italian Power Exchange (IPEX). CalPX data allow comparing the GAMLSS forecasting performance with published results obtained by different models. The study points out that the GAMLSS framework can be a flexible alternative to several linear and nonlinear stochastic models. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity market price; GAMLSS models; Interval forecasting; Liberalized energy markets; Point forecasting,Electricity market; Energy markets; GAMLSS models; Interval forecasting; Point forecasting; Commerce; Computer simulation; Costs; Deregulation; Electricity; Forecasting; Statistical methods; Stochastic systems; Time series; Stochastic models; assessment method; commodity price; electricity generation; energy market; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; stochasticity; time series analysis; uncertainty analysis,Article
"Niu D., Liu D., Wu D.D.",A soft computing system for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2010,47.0,"Hourly energy prices in a competitive electricity market are volatile. Forecast of energy price is key information to help producers and purchasers involved in electricity market to prepare their corresponding bidding strategies so as to maximize their profits. It is difficult to forecast all the hourly prices with only one model for different behaviors of different hourly prices. Neither will it get excellent results with 24 different models to forecast the 24 hourly prices respectively, for there are always not sufficient data to train the models, especially the peak price in summer. This paper proposes a novel technique to forecast day-ahead electricity prices based on Self-Organizing Map neural network (SOM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. SOM is used to cluster the data automatically according to their similarity to resolve the problem of insufficient training data. SVM models for regression are built on the categories clustered by SOM separately. Parameters of the SVM models are chosen by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automatically to avoid the arbitrary parameters decision of the tester, improving the forecasting accuracy. The comparison suggests that SOM-SVM-PSO has considerable value in forecasting day-ahead price in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market, especially for summer peak prices. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Aggarwal S.K., Saini L.M., Kumar A.",Electricity price forecasting in ontario electricity market using wavelet transform in artificial neural network based model,2008,47.0,"Electricity price forecasting has become an integral part of power system operation and control. In this paper, a wavelet transform (WT) based neural network (NN) model to forecast price profile in a deregulated electricity market has been presented. The historical price data has been decomposed into wavelet domain constitutive sub series using WT and then combined with the other time domain variables to form the set of input variables for the proposed forecasting model. The behavior of the wavelet domain constitutive series has been studied based on statistical analysis. It has been observed that forecasting accuracy can be improved by the use of WT in a forecasting model. Multi-scale analysis from one to seven levels of decomposition has been performed and the empirical evidence suggests that accuracy improvement is highest at third level of decomposition. Forecasting performance of the proposed model has been compared with (i) a heuristic technique, (ii) a simulation model used by Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), (iii) a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model, (iv) NN model, (v) Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, (vi) Dynamic Regression (DR) model, and (vii) Transfer Function (TF) model.

"Jiang Z., Tan J.",How the removal of energy subsidy affects general price in China: A study based on input-output model,2013,46.0,"In China, most energy prices are controlled by the government and are under-priced, which means energy subsidies existing. Reforming energy subsidies have important implications for sustainable development through their effects on energy price, energy use and CO2 emission. This paper applies a price-gap approach to estimate China's fossil-fuel related subsidies with the consideration of the external cost. Results indicate that the magnitude of subsidies amounted to CNY 1214.24 billion in 2008, equivalent to 4.04% of GDP of that year. Subsidies for oil products are the largest, followed by subsidies for the coal and electricity. Furthermore, an input-output model is used to analyze the impacts of energy subsidies reform on different industries and general price indexes. The findings show that removal of energy subsidies will have significant impact on energy-intensive industry, and consequently push up the general price level, yet with a small variation. Removing oil products subsidies will have the largest impact, followed by electricity, coal and natural gas. However, no matter which energy price increases, PPI is always the most affected, then GDP deflator, with CPI being the least. Corresponding compensation measures should be accordingly designed to offset the negative impact caused by energy subsidies reform. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Energy prices; Energy subsidies; Input-output model,Compensation measures; Energy intensive industries; Energy prices; Energy subsidies; External costs; Input output model; Price-gap approaches; Small variations; Carbon dioxide; Costs; energy efficiency; energy market; fossil fuel; Gross Domestic Product; input-output analysis; numerical model; price determination; price dynamics; subsidy system; sustainable development; China,Article

Using plant-level data from the Census of Manufactures, I compare the energy intensity of entrants and incumbents from 1967-97.

The estimate implies that technology adoption by incumbents explains a statistically significant but relatively small fraction of changes in aggregate energy demand in the 1970s and 1980s.

The objective of the H-GENCO can be either to maximize profit, taking into account technical efficiency, or to maximize technical efficiency, maintaining a profit level. In both cases, the efficiency can be accurately obtained using the Hill diagram supplied by turbine manufacturers. A multiple nonlinear regression analysis of the unit's technical efficiency is estimated as a quadratic function of net head and water discharge. Several case studies of realistic dimensions are described, where results indicate that a profit-based MINLP produces better results compared to an MILP model, on the other hand, higher efficiencies and water savings are obtained in the efficiency-based model. © 2010 IEEE.",Hill diagram; hydroelectric generation; net head; technical efficiency; water discharge,Hill diagram; hydroelectric generation; net head; Technical efficiency; water discharge; Electric industry; Integer programming; Lakes; Optimization; Profitability; Regression analysis; Reservoirs (water); Scheduling; Efficiency,Article
"Ghoshray A., Johnson B.",Trends in world energy prices,2010,45.0,"The correct identification of the time series path of non-renewable energy resources has far reaching consequences for economists and policymakers alike. This study builds on the existing literature by employing a data series that includes a sample period of institutional change and recently developed unit root testing procedures. Besides crude oil, natural gas and coal prices are also examined, aiming to further the knowledge of non-renewable energy resource time paths in order to inform future research and update the conclusions of past studies. The unit root tests allow for structural breaks and are based on the procedures developed by Zivot and Andrews (1992), Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) and Lee and Strazicich (2003). Finally, we investigate whether the trend changes signs in the regimes which are bounded by the structural breaks and quantify the prevalence of the trends over the sample period considered. The results show that the trend is not well represented by a single positive or negative trend. The variability of the trend suggests that forecasting energy prices should not typically occur about a single trend. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Energy prices; Structural breaks; Trends,Data series; Energy prices; Institutional change; Non-renewable energy resources; Policy makers; Structural break; Trends; Unit root; World energies; Coal deposits; Coal research; Costs; Crude oil; Natural gas deposits; Time series; Renewable energy resources; commodity price; energy market; energy resource; structural adjustment; trend analysis,Article
"Chan K.F., Gray P., van Campen B.",A new approach to characterizing and forecasting electricity price volatility,2008,45.0,"There is a growing need to model the dynamics of electricity spot prices. While many studies have adopted the jump-diffusion model used successfully in traditional financial markets, the distinctive features of energy prices present non-trivial challenges. In particular, electricity price series feature extreme jumps of magnitudes rarely seen in financial markets, and occurring at greater frequency. Standard parametric approaches to estimating jump-diffusion models struggle to disentangle the jump and non-jump variation. This paper explores a recently-developed approach to separating the total variation into jump and non-jump components. Using quadratic variation theory, we non-parametrically estimate jump parameters for five power markets which are known to feature some important physical differences. The unique characteristics of the jump and non-jump components of the total variation are studied for each market. Given the evidence that the two sources of variation in spot prices have distinct dynamics, the paper explores whether volatility forecasts can be improved by explicitly incorporating the jump and non-jump components of the total variation. © 2008 International Institute of Forecasters.",Bipower variation; Jumps; Quadratic variation; Realized volatility; Volatility forecast,,Article

Higher energy price uncertainty is found to make firms more cautious by reducing the responsiveness of investment to sales growth. The result is robust to consideration of energy intensity by industry. The effect is greater for high growth firms. It must be emphasized that the direct effect of uncertainty is not estimated.

"Rintamäki T., Siddiqui A.S., Salo A.",Does renewable energy generation decrease the volatility of electricity prices? An analysis of Denmark and Germany,2017,43.0,"Although variable renewable energy (VRE) technologies with zero marginal costs decrease electricity prices, the literature is inconclusive about how the resulting shift in the supply curves impacts price volatility. Because the flexibility to respond to high peak and low off-peak prices is crucial for demand-response applications and may compensate for the losses of conventional generators caused by lower average prices, there is a need to understand how the penetration of VRE affects volatility. In this paper, we build distributed lag models with Danish and German data to estimate the impact of VRE generation on electricity price volatility. We find that in Denmark wind power decreases the daily volatility of prices by flattening the hourly price profile, but in Germany it increases the volatility because it has a stronger impact on off-peak prices. Our analysis suggests that access to flexible generation capacity and wind power generation patterns contribute to these differing impacts. Meanwhile, solar power decreases price volatility in Germany. By contrast, the weekly volatility of prices increases in both areas due to the intermittency of VRE. Thus, policy measures for facilitating the integration of VRE should be tailored to such region-specific patterns. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",EEX; Electricity price volatility; Nord Pool; Solar power; Time-series model; Wind power,Electric power generation; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Wind power; Conventional generators; Distributed lag models; Electricity price volatilities; Generation capacity; Nord Pool; Renewable energy generation; Time series modeling; Variable renewable energies; Costs; alternative energy; electricity supply; numerical model; price dynamics; renewable resource; solar power; time series; wind power; Denmark; Germany,Article
"Pape C., Hagemann S., Weber C.",Are fundamentals enough? Explaining price variations in the German day-ahead and intraday power market,2016,43.0,"European electricity market participants are encouraged to balance intraday deviations from their day-ahead schedules via trades in the intraday market. Together with the increasing production of variable renewable energy sources (RES), the intraday market is gaining importance. We investigate the explanatory power of a fundamental modeling approach explicitly accounting for must-run operations of combined heat and power plants (CHP) and intraday peculiarities such as a shortened intraday supply stack. The fundamental equilibria between every hour's supply stack and aggregated demand in 2012 and 2013 are modeled to yield hourly price estimates. The major benefits of a fundamental modeling approach are the ability to account for non-linearities in the supply stack and the ability to combine time-varying information consistently. The empirical results show that fundamental modeling explains a considerable share of spot price variance. However, differences between the fundamental and actual prices persist and are explored using regression models. The main differences can be attributed to (avoided) start up-costs, market states and trading behavior. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Fundamental price modeling; Intraday market for electricity,Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Costs; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Explanatory power; Fundamental models; Increasing production; Market participants; Price models; Regression model; Time-varying information; Variable renewable energies; Power markets; demand analysis; electricity supply; energy market; heat production; power plant; price dynamics; Germany,Article
"Voronin S., Partanen J.","Forecasting electricity price and demand using a hybrid approach based on wavelet transform, ARIMA and neural networks",2014,43.0,"Demand and price forecasting are extremely important for participants in energy markets. Most research work in the area predicts demand and price signals separately. In this paper, a model is presented which predicts electricity demand and price simultaneously. The model combines wavelet transforms, ARIMA models and neural networks. Both time domain and wavelet domain variables are considered in the feature set for price and demand forecasting. The best input set is selected by two-step correlation analysis. The proposed model is better adapted to real conditions of an energy market since the forecast features for price and demand are not assumed as known values but are predicted by the model, thus accounting for the interactions of the demand and price forecast processes. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using data from the Finnish energy market, which is part of the Nordic Power Pool.

"Haldrup N., Nielsen F.S., Nielsen M.Ø.",A vector autoregressive model for electricity prices subject to long memory and regime switching,2010,43.0,"A regime dependent VAR model is suggested that allows long memory (fractional integration) in each of the observed regime states as well as the possibility of fractional cointegration. The model is motivated by the dynamics of electricity prices where the transmission of power is subject to occasional congestion periods. For a system of bilateral prices non-congestion means that electricity prices are identical whereas congestion makes prices depart. Hence, the joint price dynamics implies switching between a univariate price process under non-congestion and a bivariate price process under congestion. At the same time, it is an empirical regularity that electricity prices tend to show a high degree of long memory, and thus that prices may be fractionally cointegrated.Analysis of Nord Pool data shows that even though the prices are identical under non-congestion, the prices are not, in general, fractionally cointegrated in the congestion state. Hence, in most cases price convergence is a property following from regime switching rather than a conventional error correction mechanism. Finally, the suggested model is shown to deliver forecasts that are more precise compared to competing models. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Cointegration; Electricity prices; Fractional integration; Long memory; Regime switching,Cointegration; Electricity prices; Fractional integration; Long memories; Regime switching; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Lakes; Switching; Costs; cointegration analysis; commodity price; electricity; empirical analysis; error correction; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; price dynamics; vector autoregression,Article
"Unsihuay-Vila C., Zambroni de Souza A.C., Marangon-Lima J.W., Balestrassi P.P.",Electricity demand and spot price forecasting using evolutionary computation combined with chaotic nonlinear dynamic model,2010,43.0,"This paper proposes a new hybrid approach based on nonlinear chaotic dynamics and evolutionary strategy to forecast electricity loads and prices. The main idea is to develop a new training or identification stage in a nonlinear chaotic dynamic based predictor. In the training stage five optimal parameters for a chaotic based predictor are searched through an optimization model based on evolutionary strategy. The objective function of the optimization model is the mismatch minimization between the multi-step-ahead forecasting of predictor and observed data such as it is done in identification problems. The first contribution of this paper is that the proposed approach is capable of capturing the complex dynamic of demand and price time series considered resulting in a more accuracy forecasting. The second contribution is that the proposed approach run on-line manner, i.e. the optimal set of parameters and prediction is executed automatically which can be used to prediction in real-time, it is an advantage in comparison with other models, where the choice of their input parameters are carried out off-line, following qualitative/experience-based recipes. A case study of load and price forecasting is presented using data from New England, Alberta, and Spain. A comparison with other methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and artificial neural network (ANN) is shown. The results show that the proposed approach provides a more accurate and effective forecasting than ARIMA and ANN methods. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Amjady N., Keynia F.",Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by a new feature selection algorithm and cascaded neural network technique,2009,43.0,"With the introduction of restructuring into the electric power industry, the price of electricity has become the focus of all activities in the power market. Electricity price forecast is key information for electricity market managers and participants. However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its non-linear, non-stationary, and time variant behavior. In spite of performed research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this paper, a new forecast strategy is proposed for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets. Our forecast strategy is composed of a new two stage feature selection technique and cascaded neural networks. The proposed feature selection technique comprises modified Relief algorithm for the first stage and correlation analysis for the second stage. The modified Relief algorithm selects candidate inputs with maximum relevancy with the target variable. Then among the selected candidates, the correlation analysis eliminates redundant inputs. Selected features by the two stage feature selection technique are used for the forecast engine, which is composed of 24 consecutive forecasters. Each of these 24 forecasters is a neural network allocated to predict the price of 1 h of the next day. The whole proposed forecast strategy is examined on the Spanish and Australia's National Electricity Markets Management Company (NEMMCO) and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Price J.E.,Market-based price differentials in zonal and LMP market designs,2007,43.0,"The California ISO is redesigning procedures for scheduling, dispatch, and congestion management, which are critical to reliable, nondiscriminatory transmission service. The redesign implements Security Constrained Unit Commitment and Locational Marginal Pricing to reflect actual costs of delivering energy, using an accurate network model to price both congestion and losses. CAISO simulations of the market redesign are a unique opportunity to compare a) estimated LMPs if the redesign were in place during recent historical periods with b) actual conditions, as logged in operating records. The study uses market schedules and bids in an Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow simulation. Resulting LMPs are similar within current congestion zones, but price differences occur during high loads, reflecting actual changes in system conditions. The frequency and magnitude of LMP differences are consistent with the current market, suggesting that the increased market transparency will produce stable, predictable prices.

"Wang J., Liu F., Song Y., Zhao J.",A novel model: Dynamic choice artificial neural network (DCANN) for an electricity price forecasting system,2016,42.0,"Big data mining, analysis, and forecasting always play a vital role in modern economic and industrial fields. Thus, how to select an optimization model to improve the forecasting accuracy of electricity price is not only an extremely challenging problem but also a concerned problem for different participants in an electricity market due to our society becoming heavily reliant on electricity. Many researchers developed hybrid models through the use of optimization methods, classical statistical models, artificial intelligence approaches and de-noising methods. However, few researchers aim to select reasonable samples and determine appropriate features when forecasting electricity price. Based on the Index of Bad Samples Matrix (IBSM), a novel method to dynamically confirm bad training samples, and the Optimization Algorithm (OA), DCANN and Updated DCANN are proposed in this paper for forecasting the day-ahead electricity price. This model is a hybrid system of supervised and unsupervised learning and creatively applies the idea of deleting bad samples and searching quality inputs to develop and learn, which is unlike BPANN, RBFN, SVM and LSSVM. Numerical results show that the proposed model is not only able to approximate the actual electricity price (normal or high volatility) but also an effective tool for h-step-ahead forecasting (h is less than 10) compared to benchmarks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Dynamic choosing artificial neural network (DCANN); Electricity price; Index of bad samples matrix (IBSM); Optimization algorithm (OA); Unsupervised learning,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Costs; Data mining; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Unsupervised learning; Bad samples; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Optimization algorithms; Optimization modeling; Supervised and unsupervised learning; Power markets,Article

However, the time series of electricity price has nonlinear, non-stationary and volatile behaviour and so its forecast method should have high learning capability to extract the complex input/output mapping function of electricity price. In this paper, a Combinatorial Neural Network (CNN) based forecasting engine is proposed to predict the future values of price data. The CNN-based forecasting engine is equipped with a new training mechanism for optimizing the weights of the CNN. This training mechanism is based on an efficient stochastic search method, which is a modified version of chemical reaction optimization algorithm, giving high learning ability to the CNN. The proposed price forecast strategy is tested on the real-world electricity markets of Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) and mainland Spain and its obtained results are extensively compared with the results obtained from several other forecast methods. These comparisons illustrate effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Keynia F.,A new feature selection algorithm and composite neural network for electricity price forecasting,2012,42.0,"In a competitive electricity market, the forecasting of energy prices is an important activity for all the market participants either for developing bidding strategies or for making investment decisions. In this paper, a new forecast strategy is proposed for day ahead prediction of electricity price, which is a complex signal with nonlinear, volatile and time dependent behavior. Our forecast strategy includes a new two stage feature selection algorithm, a composite neural network (CNN) and a few auxiliary predictors. The feature selection algorithm has two filtering stages to remove irrelevant and redundant candidate inputs, respectively. This algorithm is based on mutual information (MI) criterion and selects the input variables of the CNN among a large set of candidate inputs. The CNN is composed of a few neural networks (NN) with a new data flow among its building blocks. The CNN is the forecast engine of the proposed strategy. A kind of cross-validation technique is also presented to fine-tune the adjustable parameters of the feature selection algorithm and CNN. Moreover, the proposed price forecast strategy is equipped with a few auxiliary predictors to enrich the candidate set of inputs of the forecast engine.

"Ruibal C.M., Mazumdar M.",Forecasting the mean and the variance of electricity prices in deregulated markets,2008,42.0,"A fundamental bid-based stochastic model is presented to predict electricity hourly prices and average price in a given period. The model captures both the economic and physical aspects of the pricing process, considering two sources of uncertainty: availability of the units and demand. This work is based on three oligopoly models-Bertrand, Cournot, and supply function equilibrium (SFE) due to Rudkevich, Duckworth, and Rosen-and obtains closed form expressions for expected value and variance of electricity hourly prices and average price. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the number of firms, anticipated peak demand, and price elasticity of demand. The results show that as the number of firms in the market decreases, the expected values of prices increase by a significant amount. Variances for the Cournot model also increase, but the variances for the SFE model decrease, taking even smaller values than Bertrand's. Thus, if the Rudkevich model is an accurate representation of the electricity market, the results show that an introduction of competition may decrease the expected value of prices but the variances may actually increase. Finally, using a refinement of the model, it has been demonstrated that an accurate temperature forecast can reduce significantly the prediction error of the electricity prices. © 2007 IEEE.","Average prices; Bertrand model; Cournot model; Deregulated electricity markets; Edgeworth expansion; Electricity price variance; Electricity prices; Hourly prices; Method of cumulants; Rudkevich, Duckworth, and Rosen's formula; Stochastic load; Supply function equilibrium",Competition; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electric load management; Marketing; Stochastic models; Uncertainty analysis; Bertrand model; Cournot model; Edgeworth expansion; Electricity price variance; Method of cumulants; Supply function equilibrium; Electric rates,Article

Due to the challenging nature of electricity prices, which includes high volatility, sharp price spikes and seasonality, various types of electricity price forecasting models still compete and cannot outperform each other consistently.

Deregulated in 1991, this market is pretty mature and it offers numerous data required carrying out an interesting study. Stochastic and seasonal water inflow, water storage possibilities and demand variations make this market interesting both from a theoretical and empirical view. We establish a small supply-demand model of the Norwegian electricity market. The model is estimated using weekly data from 1994 to 1995. Data for 1996 are used for post-sample examination of the model.

One option for the risk-averse marketer who wants to hedge against the spot-price volatility is to engage in cross hedging to reduce the contract's profit variance, and to determine the forward-contract price as a risk-adjusted price - the sum of a baseline price and a risk premium. We show how the marketer can estimate the spot-price relationship between two wholesale energy markets for the purpose of cross hedging, as well as the optimal hedge and the forward contract's baseline price and risk premium. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

"González J.P., Roque A.M.S., Pérez E.A.",Forecasting functional time series with a new hilbertian ARMAX model: Application to electricity price forecasting,2018,40.0,"A functional time series is the realization of a stochastic process where each observation is a continuous function defined on a finite interval. These processes are commonly found in electricity markets and are gaining more importance as more market data become available and markets head toward continuous-time marginal pricing approaches. Forecasting these time series requires models that operate with continuous functions. This paper proposes a new functional forecasting method that attempts to generalize the standard seasonal ARMAX time series model to the L2 Hilbert space. The structure of the proposed model is a linear regression where functional parameters operate on functional variables. The variables can be lagged values of the series (autoregressive terms), past observed innovations (moving average terms), or exogenous variables. In this approach, the functional parameters used are integral operators whose kernels are modeled as linear combinations of sigmoid functions. The parameters of each sigmoid are optimized using a Quasi-Newton algorithm that minimizes the sum of squared errors. This novel approach allows us to estimate the moving average terms in functional time series models. The new model is tested by forecasting the daily price profile of the Spanish and German electricity markets and it is compared to other functional reference models. © 2017 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Functional ARMAX model; Functional data analysis; Functional time series,Commerce; Continuous time systems; Costs; Forecasting; Functions; Power markets; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Time series; ARMAX model; Electricity price forecasting; Functional data analysis; Functional forecasting; Functional parameters; Functional time series; Quasi-newton algorithm; Sum of squared errors; Time series analysis,Article

"Bolinger M., Wiser R.",Understanding wind turbine price trends in the U.S. over the past decade,2012,40.0,"On a $/kW basis, wind turbine prices in the U.S. have declined by nearly one-third on average since 2008, after having previously doubled over the period from 2002 through 2008. These two substantial and opposing trends over the past decade - and particularly the earlier price doubling - run counter to the smooth, gradually declining cost trajectories predicted by standard learning curve theory. Taking a bottom-up approach, we examine seven possible drivers of wind turbine prices in the U.S., with the goal of estimating the degree to which each contributed to the doubling in turbine prices from 2002 through 2008, as well as the subsequent decline in prices through 2010. In aggregate, these seven drivers - which include changes in labor costs, warranty provisions, manufacturer profitability, turbine scaling, raw materials prices, energy prices, and foreign exchange rates - explain from 70% to 90% (depending on the year) of empirically observed wind turbine price movements in the U.S. through 2010. Turbine scaling is found to have been the largest single contributor to the price doubling through 2008, although the incremental cost of scaling has been justified by greater energy capture, resulting in a lower cost of wind generation. © 2011.",Cost trends; Learning curves; Wind turbines,Bottom up approach; Declining costs; Energy capture; Energy prices; Foreign exchange rates; Incremental cost; Labor costs; Learning curve theory; Learning curves; Lower cost; Price movement; Price trends; Run counters; Wind generation; Cost accounting; Employment; Profitability; Wages; Wind turbines; Costs; bottom-up approach; energy market; exchange rate; price dynamics; wind turbine; United States,Article
"Amjady N., Keynia F.",Electricity market price spike analysis by a hybrid data model and feature selection technique,2010,40.0,"In a competitive electricity market, energy price forecasting is an important activity for both suppliers and consumers. For this reason, many techniques have been proposed to predict electricity market prices in the recent years. However, electricity price is a complex volatile signal owning many spikes. Most of electricity price forecast techniques focus on the normal price prediction, while price spike forecast is a different and more complex prediction process. Price spike forecasting has two main aspects: prediction of price spike occurrence and value. In this paper, a novel technique for price spike occurrence prediction is presented composed of a new hybrid data model, a novel feature selection technique and an efficient forecast engine. The hybrid data model includes both wavelet and time domain variables as well as calendar indicators, comprising a large candidate input set. The set is refined by the proposed feature selection technique evaluating both relevancy and redundancy of the candidate inputs. The forecast engine is a probabilistic neural network, which are fed by the selected candidate inputs of the feature selection technique and predict price spike occurrence.

"Li K., Fang L., He L.",How population and energy price affect China's environmental pollution?,2019,39.0,"This paper examines the impact of population and energy price on China's environmental pollution through both industrial and residential channels. Our theoretical models reveal that the influences of population on environmental pollution are contingent on wage stickiness and wage elasticity. We also predict that environment pollution decreases with rising energy price, but downward energy price distortion intensifies environmental pollution. We test these hypotheses using panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2001 to 2016 and employing both constant coefficient and time-varying coefficient panel data models to conduct analyses. Our empirical results show that population growth, increased urbanization, and energy price distortion all intensify environmental pollution, while population aging and rising energy price tend to alleviate environmental pollution.

"Woo C.K., Zarnikau J., Moore J., Horowitz I.",Wind generation and zonal-market price divergence: Evidence from Texas,2011,39.0,"The extant literature on wind generation and wholesale electricity spot prices says little about how wind generation may affect any price differences between two inter-connected sub-markets. Using extensive data from the four ERCOT zones of Texas, this paper develops a two-stage model to attack the issue. The first stage is an ordered-logit regression to identify and quantify, for example, the impact of wind generation in the West zone on the estimated probability of a positive or negative price difference between the North and West zones. The second stage is a log-linear regression model that identifies and quantifies the estimated impact of wind generation on the sizes of those positive and negative price differences. It is shown that high wind generation and low load in the wind-rich ERCOT West zone tend to lead to congestion and zonal price differences, that those differences are time-dependent, and that other factors such as movements in nuclear generation and natural-gas prices, as well as fluctuating non-West zone loads, also play a role. The results have broad implications for energy policy makers that extend well beyond the borders of Texas and, indeed, those of the United States. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",ERCOT; Wind energy; Zonal-market price difference,Energy policy makers; ERCOT; High winds; Low load; Nuclear generation; Price difference; Regression model; Time-dependent; Two stage model; Wholesale electricity; Wind energy; Wind generation; Zonal prices; Zonal-market price difference; Commerce; Energy policy; Linear regression; Wind power; Costs; electricity generation; energy market; energy policy; price dynamics; regression analysis; wind power; Texas; United States,Article

Work presented in this paper is an extended version of previous works done by the authors to integrate ANN and SD method for predicting electricity price. The focus here is on sensitivity analysis of SD parameters while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) (regional transmission organization in northeast America) electricity market. Several cases are simulated by choosing (a) two, (b) three, (c) four, and (d) five SD parameters to calculate the norm. In addition, sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the time framework of SD (d = 15, 30, 45, 60) and the number of selected similar price days (N = 5, 10). From sensitivity analysis, it is identified that the optimized mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained using case-c with d = 30 and N = 10. MAPE of reasonably small value, along with forecast mean square error and mean absolute error of around 2$/MWh and 1$/MWh, is obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price.

"Pedregal D.J., Trapero J.R.",Electricity prices forecasting by automatic dynamic harmonic regression models,2007,39.0,"The changes experienced by electricity markets in recent years have created the necessity for more accurate forecast tools of electricity prices, both for producers and consumers. Many methodologies have been applied to this aim, but in the view of the authors, state space models are not yet fully exploited. The present paper proposes a univariate dynamic harmonic regression model set up in a state space framework for forecasting prices in these markets. The advantages of the approach are threefold. Firstly, a fast automatic identification and estimation procedure is proposed based on the frequency domain. Secondly, the recursive algorithms applied offer adaptive predictions that compare favourably with respect to other techniques. Finally, since the method is based on unobserved components models, explicit information about trend, seasonal and irregular behaviours of the series can be extracted. This information is of great value to the electricity companies' managers in order to improve their strategies, i.e. it provides management innovations.

Cifter A.,Forecasting electricity price volatility with the Markov-switching GARCH model: Evidence from the Nordic electric power market,2013,38.0,"In this paper, electricity price behavior in the Nordic electric power market is forecasted with both the Markov-switching generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MS-GARCH) model and a set of different volatility models. The MS-GARCH model is estimated with two regimes, representing periods of low and high volatility. This study shows that electricity price volatility is not only highly volatile but also strongly regime-dependent. The empirical results show that the MS-GARCH model enables more accurate forecasting than the standard GARCH models, according to tail loss and reality check tests for one- and multi-step ahead forecasts. The results suggest that both the electricity generation companies and consumers of electricity could carry out better price forecasts by using the proposed MS-GARCH model. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, public available data coming from Nordpool, California, and Ontario power markets were used for training and testing. Simulation results show that the proposed model is capable of forecasting short-term electricity price efficiently and accurately. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Niimura T., Ko H.-S., Ozawa K.",A day-ahead electricity price prediction based on a fuzzy-neuro autoregressive model in a deregulated electricity market,2002,38.0,"This paper presents a fuzzy regression model to estimate uncertain electricity market prices in deregulated industry environment. The price of electricity in a deregulated market is very volatile in time. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate an accurate market price using historically observed data. In the proposed method, uncertain market prices are estimated by an autoregressive model using a neural network, and the time series model is extended to fuzzy model to consider the possible ranges of market prices. The neural network finds the crisp value for AR model and then the low and high ranges of fuzzy model are found by linear programming. Therefore, the proposed model can represent the possible ranges of a day-ahead market price.

"Osório G.J., Matias J.C.O., Catalão J.P.S.",Electricity prices forecasting by a hybrid evolutionary-adaptive methodology,2014,37.0,"With the restructuring of the electricity sector in recent years, and the increased variability and uncertainty associated with electricity market prices, it has become necessary to develop forecasting tools with enhanced capabilities to support the decisions of market players in a competitive environment. Hence, this paper proposes a new hybrid evolutionary-adaptive methodology for electricity prices forecasting in the short-term, i.e., between 24 and 168 h ahead, successfully combining mutual information, wavelet transform, evolutionary particle swarm optimization, and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. In order to determine the accuracy, competence and proficiency of the proposed methodology, results from real-world case studies using real data are presented, together with a thorough comparison considering the results obtained with previously reported forecasting tools. Not only is the accuracy an important factor, but also the computational burden is relevant in a comparative study. The results show that it is possible to reduce the uncertainty associated with electricity market prices prediction without using any exogenous data, just the historical values, thus requiring just a few seconds of computation time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Wu L., Shahidehpour M.",A hybrid model for integrated day-ahead electricity price and load forecasting in smart grid,2014,37.0,"Load and price forecasting are two key issues for market participants and system operators in electricity markets. Most existing works predict load and price separately. However, a dynamic pricing type scenario is envisioned in smart grid, where consumers may have the ability to react to constantly changing price signals by shifting electricity usages from expensive hours to others, which would consequently impact electricity prices. Thus, price and load signals are strongly coupled, and previous separated forecast models may not be as effective. In this study, a two-stage integrated price and load forecasting framework is developed. The first stage provides initial price and load forecasts separately, and the second stage considers load and price interaction with initial forecasts as inputs. At each stage, a hybrid time-series and adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) model is used, in which multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average catches the linear relationship of price and load log return series, generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic unveils heteroscedastic character of residuals and AWNN presents non-linear impacts. Several criteria such as average mean absolute percentage error and error variance are used to measure the forecasting accuracy.

The algorithms introduced in Part I of this paper are simulated assuming 20% and 50% wind capacity. We show that the look-ahead dispatch of the proposed method is physically implementable and, when used with elastic demand, can accommodate the integration of close to 50% wind capacity. This is contrasted with the observation that, without elastic demand, 50% wind integration is not physically implementable. From the perspective of total market surplus, the predictive dispatch of the proposed method is 3.8% suboptimal when compared to the centralized most efficient predictive economic dispatch.

"Amjady N., Keynia F.",A new prediction strategy for price spike forecasting of day-ahead electricity markets,2011,37.0,"Price spikes are distinctive aspects of electricity price impacting its forecast accuracy. Electricity price spikes can also have serious economical effects on the market participants. However, prediction of electricity price spikes is a complex task and most of current electricity price forecast methods focus on prediction of normal prices. In this paper, a new forecast strategy for prediction of both occurrence and value of electricity price spikes is presented. The proposed strategy has a novel feature selection technique based on information theoretic criteria to select a minimum subset of the most informative features for the forecast process. Also, the strategy includes a new closed loop prediction mechanism composed of probabilistic neural network (PNN) and hybrid neuro-evolutionary system (HNES) forecast engines. The effectiveness of the proposed forecast strategy for the prediction of both price spike occurrence and value is extensively evaluated by the real-life data of PJM (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland) electricity market.

In order to do this, the SO has to provide enough power reserves which can be provided on the basis of bilateral contracts or on the relevant competitive market. In this paper, several methods for the power-reserve pricing of frequency control are presented. These methods are well suited to small power systems, where an insufficient number of potential bidders makes an ancillary-services market difficult to organize. The proposed pricing methods are meant for estimating the annual costs for power-reserves provision when these reserves are provided on the basis of bilateral contracts.

"Uniejewski B., Weron R., Ziel F.",Variance Stabilizing Transformations for Electricity Spot Price Forecasting,2018,36.0,"Most electricity spot price series exhibit price spikes. These extreme observations may significantly impact the obtained model estimates and hence reduce efficiency of the employed predictive algorithms. For markets with only positive prices, the logarithmic transform is the single most commonly used technique to reduce spike severity and consequently stabilize the variance. However, for datasets with very close to zero (like the Spanish) or negative (like the German) prices the log-transform is not feasible. What reasonable choices do we have then? To address this issue, we evaluate 16 variance stabilizing transformations within a comprehensive forecasting study involving two model classes (regression models, neural networks) and 12 datasets from diverse power markets. We show that the probability integral transform combined with the standard Gaussian distribution yields the best approach, significantly better than many of the considered alternatives. © 2017 IEEE.",Diebold-mariano test; electricity spot price; forecasting; price spike; probability integral transform; variance stabilizing transformation,Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Integral equations; Mathematical transformations; Benchmark testing; Diebold; Electricity spot price; Europe; Indexes; Integral transform; Predictive models; Price spike; Variance stabilizing transformation; Power markets,Article

"Arciniegas A.I., Arciniegas Rueda I.E.",Forecasting short-term power prices in the Ontario Electricity Market (OEM) with a fuzzy logic based inference system,2008,36.0,"The Ontario Electricity Market (OEM), which opened in May 2002, is relatively new and is still under change. In addition, the bidding strategies of the participants are such that the relationships between price and fundamentals are non-linear and dynamic. The lack of market maturity and high complexity hinders the use of traditional statistical methodologies (e.g., regression analysis) for price forecasting. Therefore, a flexible model is needed to achieve good forecasting in OEM. This paper uses a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system in forecasting the one-day-ahead real-time peak price of the OEM. The forecasting results of TSK are compared with those obtained by traditional statistical and neural network based forecasting. The comparison suggests that TSK has considerable value in forecasting one-day-ahead peak price in OEM. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Swider D.J., Weber C.",Bidding under price uncertainty in multi-unit pay-as-bid procurement auctions for power systems reserve,2007,36.0,"In this paper a methodology for profit maximized bidding under price uncertainty in a day-ahead, multi-unit and pay-as-bid procurement auction for power systems reserve is proposed. Within this novel methodology a bidder is considered to follow a Bayes-strategy. Thereby, one bidder is assumed to behave strategically and the behavior of the remaining is summarized in a probability distribution of the market price and a reaction function to price dumping by the strategic bidder. With this approach two problems arise: First, as a pay-as-bid auction is considered, no uniform price and therefore no single probability distribution of the market price is readily available. Second, if historic bidding data of all participants are used to estimate such a distribution and market power is a relevant factor, the bid of the strategically behaving bidder is likely to influence the distribution. Within this paper for both of the problems solutions are presented. It is shown that by estimating a probability of acceptance the optimal bidding price with respect to a given capacity can be calculated by maximizing a stochastic non-linear objective function of expected profit. Taking the characteristics of recently established markets in Germany into account, the methodology is applied using exemplary data. It is shown that the methodology helps to manage existing price uncertainties and hence supports the trading decisions of a bidder. It is inferred that the developed methodology may also be used for bidding on other auction markets with a similar market design. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In the clustering step, pattern sequence and their topology relations are obtained from self organizing map time series clustering. In the next symbol prediction step, with each cluster label in the pattern sequence represented as a pair of its topologically identical coordinates, artificial neural network is used to predict the topological coordinates of next day by training the relationship between previous daily pattern sequence and its next day pattern. According to the obtained topology relations, the nearest nonzero hits pattern is assigned to next day so that the whole time series values can be directly forecasted from the assigned cluster pattern.

"Voronin S., Partanen J.",Price forecasting in the day-ahead energy market by an iterative method with separate normal price and price spike frameworks,2013,35.0,"A forecasting methodology for prediction of both normal prices and price spikes in the day-ahead energy market is proposed. The method is based on an iterative strategy implemented as a combination of two modules separately applied for normal price and price spike predictions. The normal price module is a mixture of wavelet transform, linear AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and nonlinear neural network models. The probability of a price spike occurrence is produced by a compound classifier in which three single classification techniques are used jointly to make a decision. Combined with the spike value prediction technique, the output from the price spike module aims to provide a comprehensive price spike forecast. The overall electricity price forecast is formed as combined normal price and price spike forecasts. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated with real data from the Finnish Nord Pool Spot day-ahead energy market.

"Hong Y.-Y., Wu C.-P.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using a hybrid principal component analysis network,2012,35.0,"Bidding competition is one of the main transaction approaches in a deregulated electricity market. Locational marginal prices (LMPs) resulting from bidding competition and system operation conditions indicate electricity values at a node or in an area. The LMP reveals important information for market participants in developing their bidding strategies. Moreover,LMP is also a vital indicator for the Security Coordinator to perform market redispatch for congestion management. This paper presents a method using a principal component analysis (PCA) network cascaded with a multi-layer feedforward (MLF) network for forecasting LMPs in a day-ahead market. The PCA network extracts essential features from periodic information in the market. These features serve as inputs to the MLF network for forecasting LMPs. The historical LMPs in the PJM market are employed to test the proposed method.

"Erlwein C., Benth F.E., Mamon R.",HMM filtering and parameter estimation of an electricity spot price model,2010,35.0,"In this paper we develop a model for electricity spot price dynamics. The spot price is assumed to follow an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with an added compound Poisson process. In this way, the model allows for mean-reversion and possible jumps. All parameters are modulated by a hidden Markov chain in discrete time. They are able to switch between different economic regimes representing the interaction of various factors. Through the application of reference probability technique, adaptive filters are derived, which in turn, provide optimal estimates for the state of the Markov chain and related quantities of the observation process. The EM algorithm is applied to find optimal estimates of the model parameters in terms of the recursive filters. We implement this self-calibrating model on a deseasonalised series of daily spot electricity prices from the Nordic exchange Nord Pool.

An approach to predict the market behaviors is to use the historical prices, loads and other required information to forecast the future prices and loads. This paper introduces an approach for several-hours-ahead electricity price and load forecasting using artificial intelligence method, such as neural network model, which uses publicly available data from NEMMCO web site to forecast electricity prices and loads for the Victorian electricity market. An approach of selection of similar days is proposed according to which the load and price curves are forecasted by using the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. A Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of similar days. Two different ANN models, one for several-hours-ahead load forecasting and another for several-hours-ahead price forecasting have been proposed. The forecasted price and load from the neural network is obtained by adding a correction to the selected similar days, and the correction is obtained from the neural network.

"Li Y., Flynn P.C.",Deregulated power prices: Comparison of volatility,2004,34.0,"We examine electrical power price variability for 14 deregulated markets. Power price volatility is measured by price velocity, the daily average of the absolute value of price change per hour. Deregulated markets show a wide variability in price velocity. Some price velocity is expected and arises from the daily diurnal price pattern, which differs significantly between markets. Even when the expected daily variability in price is removed, the residual unexpected variability differs between markets. Some deregulated markets, most notably Britain and Spain, show patterns that are predictable and consistent and have low values of unexpected price velocity. These markets create a climate conducive to consumers facing the market through real time pricing and shaping consumption behaviors in response to price changes. Other markets, for example, South Australia and Alberta, have patterns that are inconsistent and irregular, and hence are hard for a customer to interpret; a customer in such a market will have a higher incentive to avoid demand side management and escape risk through hedging mechanisms. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these variables are not (timely) available for every market participant and this paper suggests to use temperature as a proxy.

Traditional price forecasting techniques show poor performance in handling price spikes, which usually follow a pattern different from the prices under normal market conditions. Therefore, novel approaches are required to forecast both the occurrences and values of spikes. In this paper a comprehensive study is conducted to investigate the performance of several data mining techniques for spike forecasting. Another major contribution of this paper is that a novel approach is proposed to integrate the spike forecasting process with decision-making, and to provide a comprehensive risk management tool against spikes. This approach is based on the Naïve Bayesian Classifier. The benefits/costs of possible decisions are considered in the spike forecasting process to achieve the maximum benefits from the decisions against price spikes.

"Lo K.L., Wu Y.K.",Analysis of relationships between hourly electricity price and load in deregulated real-time power markets,2004,33.0,"Risk management in the electric power industry involves measuring the risk for all instruments owned by a company. The value of many of these instruments depends directly on electricity prices. In theory, the wholesale price in a real-time market should reflect the short-run marginal cost, However, most markets are not perfectly competitive, therefore by understanding the degree of correlation between price and physical drivers, electric traders and consumers can manage their risk more effectively and efficiently. Market data from two power-pool architectures, both pre-2003 ISO-NE and Australia's NEM, have been studied. The dynamic character of electricity price is mean-reverting, and consists of intra-day and weekly variations, seasonal fluctuations, and instant jumps. Parts of them are affected by load demands. Hourly signals on both price and load are divided into deterministic and random components with a discrete fourier transform algorithm. Next, the real-time price-load relationship for periodic and random signals is examined.

We estimate dynamic equations of unregulated, wholesale power prices at spot markets scattered over an eleven-state trading region. The results indicate that this decentralized system of power and transmission trading produces prices that are efficient and dynamically stable over this vast network, Price convergence in the power market is similar to what has been observed in the recently deregulated natural gas market.",,,Article
"Singh N., Mohanty S.R., Dev Shukla R.",Short term electricity price forecast based on environmentally adapted generalized neuron,2017,32.0,"The liberalization of the power markets gained a remarkable momentum in the context of trading electricity as a commodity. With the upsurge in restructuring of the power markets, electricity price plays a dominant role in the current deregulated market scenario which is majorly influenced by the economics being governed. In the deregulated environment price forecasting is an important aspect for the power system planning. The problem of price forecasting can be entirely viewed as a signal processing problem with proper estimation of model parameters, modeling of uncertainties, etc. Among the different existing models the artificial neural network based models have gained wide popularity due their black box structure but it too has its own limitations. In the proposed work in order to overcome the limitations of the classical artificial neural network model, generalized neuron model is used for forecasting the short term electricity price of Australian electricity market. The pre-processing of the input parameters is accomplished using wavelet transform for better representation of the low and high frequency components. The free parameters of the generalized neuron model are tuned using environment adaptation method algorithm for increasing the generalization ability and efficacy of the model. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Environment adaptation method; Generalized neuron model; IEAM; Price forecasting; Wavelet transform,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Neural networks; Neurons; Parameter estimation; Signal processing; Uncertainty analysis; Wavelet transforms; Artificial neural network modeling; Australian electricity market; Environment adaptation; Generalized neuron; IEAM; Low and high frequencies; Price forecasting; Signal processing problems; Power markets; algorithm; analytical method; artificial neural network; commodity price; electricity; energy market; energy planning; forecasting method; market conditions; numerical model; price dynamics; transform; wavelet analysis; Australia,Article
"Aneiros G., Vilar J., Raña P.",Short-term forecast of daily curves of electricity demand and price,2016,32.0,"The features of the electricity, as well as the rules of the competitive electricity markets, create the need of accurate predictions of electricity demand and price in order to anticipate decisions. Mainly, the prediction task in energy markets has been studied in the literature with the aim of obtaining scalar (hourly, daily, ...) forecasts given scalar (and/or, less frequently, functional) historical data. This paper provides two methods to predict next-day electricity demand and price daily curves given information from past curves. They are based on using robust functional principal component analysis and nonparametric models with functional both response and covariate. In addition, the nonparametric proposal is extended to incorporate, in a linear way, exogenous scalar covariates. Results of these methods for the electricity market of mainland Spain, in year 2012, are reported. Their accuracy is compared with that of a naïve method as well as with the corresponding to combining forecasts. Scalar versions are also included in the comparative study.

The goal is to increase the overall profit of the portfolio by reducing imbalances and, consequently, their implicit penalty in a two-price balancing market for electricity. We investigate two different operational strategies, which differ in whether the CHP plant and the wind farm are operated jointly or independently, and we evaluate their economic performance on a real case study based on a CHP-wind system located in the western part of Denmark. We present a comprehensive mathematical model for describing the different heat and power production units of the CHP plant and suggest different ways of determining its operation in a setup with two trading floors: a day-ahead market and a balancing market. We build a simulation framework that runs in a rolling-horizon fashion, so that forecasts for heat demand, wind power production, and market prices are updated at each iteration. We conclude that the portfolio strategy is the most profitable due to the two-price structure of the balancing market. This encourages producers to handle their imbalances outside the market. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Balancing market; combined heat and power (CHP); electricity market; optimal portfolio operation; wind power,Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Power markets; Profitability; Wind power; Balancing market; Combined heat and power plants; Day ahead market; Economic performance; Operational strategies; Portfolio strategies; Simulation framework; Wind power production; Cogeneration plants,Article

These scenarios are most likely to be generated based on marginal predictive densities for such prices, then enhanced with a temporal dependence structure. A semi-parametric methodology for generating such densities is presented: it includes: (i) a time-adaptive quantile regression model for the 5%-95% quantiles; and (ii) a description of the distribution tails with exponential distributions. The forecasting skill of the proposed model is compared to that of four benchmark approaches and the well-known the generalist autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model over a three-year evaluation period. While all benchmarks are outperformed in terms of forecasting skill overall, the superiority of the semi-parametric model over the GARCH model lies in the former's ability to generate reliable quantile estimates. © 2014 by the authors.",Density forecasting; Electricity prices; Non-stationarity; Quantile regression; Stochastic processes,Costs; Decision making; Forecasting; Random processes; Regression analysis; Stochastic systems; Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Day-ahead electricity market; Density forecasting; Electricity prices; Exponential distributions; Non-stationarities; Quantile regression; Semi-parametric modeling; Power markets,Article
"Li H., Han Z.",Manipulating the electricity power market via jamming the price signaling in smart grid,2011,32.0,"While enhancing the efficiency and agility to the power system, the communication infrastructure in smart grid also incurs vulnerabilities to the reliability of the power market and power grid. A novel attacking scheme is proposed, in which an attacker jams the signaling of power price and then ceases jamming when the power price has been significantly changed. The power users jammed by the attacker will make a rapid response to the changed power price, whose change direction can be predicted by the attacker. Then, the attacker can manipulate the price in the power market and thus makes profit. The abrupt change of power consumption will also cause a significant impact on the power grid stability. The effect of such an attack will be discussed both analytically and numerically. A countermeasure for this attack is also proposed. © 2011 IEEE.",,Communication infrastructure; Electricity power markets; Power grid stability; Power grids; Power markets; Power price; Power users; Rapid response; Significant impacts; Smart grid; Commerce; Jamming; Power quality; Profitability; Smart power grids; Costs,Conference Paper
"Sarkar V., Khaparde S.A.",DCOPF-based marginal loss pricing with enhanced power flow accuracy by using matrix loss distribution,2009,32.0,"On current days, many of the power markets are adopting the practice of marginal loss pricing. The dc optimal power flow (DCOPF) model is still mostly used for the purpose of market clearing owing to its simplicity, robustness and higher speed of convergence. Within the DCOPF framework, transmission line losses are represented as additional external loads on the system. In the classical DCOPF model of marginal loss pricing, as implemented in the New England market, the aggregated network loss is distributed over the system nodes in a fixed ratio. To gain more design flexibility in the distribution of system losses, a matrix loss distribution (MLD) framework is developed in this paper maintaining compatibility with financial transmission rights. In MLD, each individual line is considered separately for the purpose of loss distribution. The ratio in which the power loss in a certain line is distributed can be different from that in which the power loss in another line is distributed. The additional design flexibility thus obtained assists in making a more accurate representation of the power flow. The benefit of MLD is illustrated through a case study. An energy reference independent application of MLD is also suggested. © 2009 IEEE.",Estimation-based loss distribution; Financial transmission rights; Locational marginal price; Marginal loss pricing; Matrix loss distribution; Power flow accuracy; Revenue adequacy; Vector loss distribution,Financial transmission rights; Locational marginal price; Marginal loss pricing; Matrix loss distribution; Power flow accuracy; Revenue adequacy; Commerce; Economics; Electric load flow; Light transmission; Power electronics; Costs,Article

In the first scenario, the model is build based solely on the lagged values of the HOEP. In the second scenario, current and lagged values of the latest predispatch price and demand information, made available by the Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), are also considered as explanatory variables.

Due to the complicated factors affecting electricity prices, accurate forecasting price turns out to be very difficult and usually cannot be achieved by a single forecasting model. This paper proposes an ARIMA approach to price forecasting with accuracy improvement by predicted errors. Besides a conventional model for price forecasting, models for forecasting residual errors are also established iteratively. ARIMA models for forecasting daily average prices, based on historical data of Californian Power Market, are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Results show that the method only requires easy-implemented low-order models instead of one complex model, while the accuracy of forecasting is improved significantly. The methodology can also be applied to forecasting market clearing prices and electricity loads.",ARTMA models; Electricity price forecasting; Error forecasting; Power markets,Chaos theory; Classification (of information); Costs; Electricity; Error analysis; Investments; Marketing; Risk assessment; Risk management; ARIMA models; Electricity price forecasting; Error forecasting; Power markets; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper
"Zhang X., Wang J., Gao Y.",A hybrid short-term electricity price forecasting framework: Cuckoo search-based feature selection with singular spectrum analysis and SVM,2019,30.0,"Under the liberalization and deregulation of the power industry, price forecasting has become a cornerstone for market participants' decision-making such as bidding strategies and purchase plans. However, the exclusive nonlinearity dynamics of electricity price is a challenge problem that largely affects forecasting accuracy. To address this task, this paper presents a hybrid forecasting framework for short-term electricity price forecasting by exploiting and mining the important information hidden in the electricity price signal. Moreover, a hybrid feature selection method (HFS) is introduced into the forecasting strategy. To exhibit the dynamical characteristics of electricity price, we primarily perform a singular spectrum analysis (SSA)-based systematic analysis process by using the merit of SSA and analyzing the multiple seasonal patterns of short-term electricity price series, providing a meaningful representation of the hidden patterns and time-varying volatility of electricity price series. Aiming at selecting the key features, the candidate variables are constructed considering the dynamic behavior of price series; further, to capture the optimal features from the candidates, the correlation threshold θ is defined for the adjustable parameters in HFS and optimally determined by the intelligent search algorithm. Additionally, triangulation based on the Pearson, Spearman and Kendall rank correlation coefficient is performed to strengthen the reliability of the proposed method. The proposed hybrid forecasting framework is validated in the New South Wales electricity market, which demonstrates that the developed approach is truly better than the benchmark models used and a reliable and promising tool for short-term electricity price forecasting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Hybrid feature selection; Hybrid forecasting; Key features; Price forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis,Commerce; Decision making; Deregulation; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Optimization; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Hybrid feature selections; Hybrid forecasting; Key feature; Price forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis; Power markets; algorithm; correlation; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; price dynamics; spectral analysis; support vector machine,Article
"Ziel F., Steinert R.",Probabilistic mid- and long-term electricity price forecasting,2018,30.0,"The liberalization of electricity markets and the development of renewable energy sources has led to new challenges for decision makers. These challenges are accompanied by an increasing uncertainty about future electricity price movements. The increasing amount of papers, which aim to model and predict electricity prices for a short period of time provided new opportunities for market participants. However, the electricity price literature seem to be very scarce on the issue of medium- to long-term price forecasting, which is mandatory for investment and political decisions. Our paper closes this gap by introducing a new approach to simulate electricity prices with hourly resolution for several months up to three years. Considering the uncertainty of future events we are able to provide probabilistic forecasts which are able to detect probabilities for price spikes even in the long-run. As market we decided to use the EPEX day-ahead electricity market for Germany and Austria. Our model extends the X-Model which mainly utilizes the sale and purchase curve for electricity day-ahead auctions. By applying our procedure we are able to give probabilities for the due to the EEG practical relevant event of six consecutive hours of negative prices. We find that using the supply and demand curve based model in the long-run yields realistic patterns for the time series of electricity prices and leads to promising results considering common error measures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity prices; Long-term; Negative prices; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energy; Supply and demand,Commerce; Costs; Curve fitting; Decision making; Forecasting; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Electricity prices; Long-term; Negative prices; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energies; Supply and demand; Power markets,Review
"Ziel F., Steinert R.",Electricity price forecasting using sale and purchase curves: The X-Model,2016,30.0,"Our paper aims to model and forecast the electricity price by taking a completely new perspective on the data. It will be the first approach which is able to combine the insights of market structure models with extensive and modern econometric analysis. Instead of directly modeling the electricity price as it is usually done in time series or data mining approaches, we model and utilize its true source: the sale and purchase curves of the electricity exchange. We will refer to this new model as X-Model, as almost every deregulated electricity price is simply the result of the intersection of the electricity supply and demand curve at a certain auction. Therefore we show an approach to deal with a tremendous amount of auction data, using a subtle data processing technique as well as dimension reduction and lasso based estimation methods. We incorporate not only several known features, such as seasonal behavior or the impact of other processes like renewable energy, but also completely new elaborated stylized facts of the bidding structure. Our model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of the electricity price, which is especially useful for predicting huge price spikes.

"Miranian A., Abdollahzade M., Hassani H.",Day-ahead electricity price analysis and forecasting by singular spectrum analysis,2013,29.0,"This study proposes a model-free approach for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. The proposed approached is based on the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique. The SSA is a relatively new and powerful technique in time series analysis and forecasting thanks to its well-known capabilities in extracting the main structure of the broad classes of the time series. In this study, it is shown that SSA can be employed to decompose the original electricity price series into trend, periodic and noisy components. The main part of the price series, that is, the trend and harmonic components, is reconstructed by removing the noise component from the original series. The reconstructed price series is then used for forecasting the day-ahead electricity prices. The proposed approach is evaluated by analysing and forecasting of the dayahead electricity prices in the Australian and Spanish electricity markets. The forecasting results confirm the superiority of the SSA approach compared with some of the recently published forecasting techniques. ©The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",,Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price series; Electricity prices; Forecasting techniques; Harmonic components; Noise components; Singular spectrum analysis; Spanish electricity markets; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Forecasting; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Costs,Article

The negative effect of a higher relative price of energy on firm-level investment is significantly less marked the larger the firm. Results imply that stabilizing the relative price of energy would steady firm investment with greater gains in stability at smaller and medium sized firms. Results are robust to consideration of country business cycle effect and firm leverage. Estimation of investment is based on the Euler equation approach with over 21,000 observations.

"Pandey S.N., Tapaswi S., Srivastava L.",Nodal congestion price estimation in spot power market using artificial neural network,2008,29.0,"In the world wide increasing trend of restructured power system, open access in transmission system and competition in generation and distribution have introduced a frequently occurring problem of congestion. To establish a proficient price-based congestion management procedure, the nodal pricing strategy is found to be appropriate. From congestion management point of view, the optimal nodal prices are comprised of two basic components. First component is locational marginal price, that is marginal cost of generation to supply load and transmission losses both. Second component is nodal congestion price (NCP), that is the charges to maintain network security. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm based neural network (LMANN) for estimating NCPs in spot power market by dividing the whole power system into various congestion zones is presented. Euclidian distance based clustering technique has been applied for feature selection before employing LMANN. The purpose of using artificial neural network (ANN) based approach for NCP estimation in spot power market is to exploit the tolerance for any missing or partially corrupted data to achieve tractability, robustness and very fast solution. The proposed ANN method also handles the congestion price volatility by taking continuously varying load and constrained transmission into account. The information provided by the proposed method regarding the formation of different congestion zones and the severity of congestion within a zone instructs both the market participants as well as independent system operator in making effective decisions. The proposed method has been examined for an RTS 24-bus system and is found to be quite promising. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2008.",,Algorithms; Cost accounting; Electric power systems; Problem solving; Robustness (control systems); Congestion price estimation; Nodal congestion price (NCP); Nodal pricing strategy; Neural networks,Article

Kim M.K.,Short-term price forecasting of Nordic power market by combination Levenberg-Marquardt and Cuckoo search algorithms,2015,28.0,"This study proposes a new forecasting method for short-term spot prices in the Nordic power market. It proposes a Cuckoo search Levenberg-Marquardt (CSLM)-trained, CSLM feed-forward neural network (CSLM-FFNN) for the solving process that combines the improved Levenberg Marquardt and Cuckoo search algorithms. The proposed model considers actual power generation and system load as input sets to facilitate the efficient use of both transmission and power generation resources by direct market participants. During the training, the proposed CSLM-FFNN model generalises the relationship between the area prices and the system price for the same period. The model can be updated to track online the variation trend of the electricity price and to maintain accuracy because of the rapid training speed in CSLM learning algorithm.

"Yan X., Chowdhury N.A.",Mid-term electricity market clearing price forecasting utilizing hybrid support vector machine and auto-regressive moving average with external input,2014,28.0,"Currently, there are many techniques available for short-term electricity market clearing price (MCP) forecasting, but very little has been done in the area of mid-term electricity MCP forecasting. Mid-term electricity MCP forecasting has become essential for resources reallocation, maintenance scheduling, bilateral contracting, budgeting and planning purposes. A hybrid mid-term electricity MCP forecasting model combining both support vector machine (SVM) and auto-regressive moving average with external input (ARMAX) modules is presented in this paper. The proposed hybrid model showed improved forecasting accuracy compared to forecasting models using a single SVM, a single least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and hybrid LSSVM-ARMAX.

"Li X.R., Yu C.W., Ren S.Y., Chiu C.H., Meng K.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting based on panel cointegration and particle filter,2013,28.0,"An accurate forecasting of energy price is important for generation companies (GENCOs) to develop their bidding strategies or to make investment decisions. Nowadays, day-ahead electricity market is closely associated with other commodity markets such as fuel market and emission market. Under such an environment, day-ahead electricity price is volatile and its volatility changes overtime due to the uncertainties from the multi-market. This paper proposes a two-stage hybrid model based on panel cointegration and particle filter (PCPF). Panel cointegration (PC) model, which utilizes information of both the inter-temporal dynamics and the individuality of interconnected regions, provides powerful forecasting tool for electricity price. Particle filter (PF) has achieved significant successes in tracking applications involving non-Gaussian signals and nonlinear systems. This paper has two main focuses: (1) To expand the dimension of electricity price dataset from time series to panel data so that the dynamics of interconnected regions can be analyzed simultaneously and considered as a whole. (2) Regarding the model coefficients as a time-varying process, PF is used to forecast electricity price adaptively. In the case study, the proposed PCPF model is applied to the real electricity market data of PJM in the year 2008. Promising results show clearly the superior predicting behavior of the proposed modeling. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Klæboe G., Eriksrud A.L., Fleten S.-E.",Benchmarking time series based forecasting models for electricity balancing market prices,2013,28.0,"In the trade-off between bidding in the day-ahead electricity market and the real time balancing market, producers need good forecasts for balancing market prices to make informed decisions. A range of earlier published models for forecasting of balancing market prices, including a few extensions, is benchmarked. The models are benchmarked both for 1 h-ahead and day-ahead forecast, and both point and interval forecasts are compared. None of the benchmarked models produce informative day-ahead point forecasts, suggesting that information available before the closing of the day-ahead market is efficiently reflected in the day-ahead market price rather than the balancing market price. Evaluation of the interval forecasts reveals that models without balancing state information overestimate variance, making them unsuitable for scenario generation. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Ancillary service market; Balancing market price; Electricity markets; Electricity price scenarios; Forecasting; Regulating market,Costs; Economic and social effects; Power markets; Ancillary service markets; Balancing market; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Regulating market; Forecasting,Article
"García-Martos C., Rodríguez J., Sánchez M.J.",Forecasting electricity prices and their volatilities using Unobserved Components,2011,28.0,"The liberalization of electricity markets more than ten years ago in the vast majority of developed countries has introduced the need of modelling and forecasting electricity prices and volatilities, both in the short and long term. Thus, there is a need of providing methodology that is able to deal with the most important features of electricity price series, which are well known for presenting not only structure in conditional mean but also time-varying conditional variances. In this work we propose a new model, which allows to extract conditionally heteroskedastic common factors from the vector of electricity prices. These common factors are jointly estimated as well as their relationship with the original vector of series, and the dynamics affecting both their conditional mean and variance. The estimation of the model is carried out under the state-space formulation. The new model proposed is applied to extract seasonal common dynamic factors as well as common volatility factors for electricity prices and the estimation results are used to forecast electricity prices and their volatilities in the Spanish zone of the Iberian Market. Several simplified/alternative models are also considered as benchmarks to illustrate that the proposed approach is superior to all of them in terms of explanatory and predictive power. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Conditional heteroskedasticity; Dynamic factor analysis; Iberian market; Long run; Non-stationary; Short run,Dynamic factor analysis; Heteroskedasticity; Iberian market; Long run; Nonstationary; Short run; Commerce; Costs; Dynamic analysis; Forecasting; State space methods; Time series analysis; Electricity; benchmarking; developing world; electricity; electricity supply; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; price dynamics; vector; Iberian Peninsula,Article
"Genc T.S., Sen S.",An analysis of capacity and price trajectories for the Ontario electricity market using dynamic Nash equilibrium under uncertainty,2008,28.0,"This paper studies investments in the Ontario Electricity Market which is currently being restructured. Our methodology is based on the concept of S-adapted open-loop Nash equilibrium. We examine the evolution of capital investments and pricing behavior of suppliers as uncertain electricity demand evolves over time (in Ontario). This study is particularly interesting since we compare the implications of two policies: (i) the current setting in which Ontario Power Generation (OPG) retains its generation units; (ii) the policy (set up in 2003) that required the divestiture of the largest supplier, OPG, and aimed to increase the number of independent suppliers in Ontario. We mainly focus on the independent generators like Bruce Nuclear. We use the tools of Stochastic Programming to compute the S-adapted open-loop Nash equilibrium market outcomes. We find that in the three-player market total capacity installation and market prices are higher than the ones in the five-player market. That is higher capacity may not necessarily alleviate exercise of market power. We also confirm the prediction by the National Energy Board that in a market with five major players, OPG's market share may reduce to a percentage between 35% and 40%. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"Zhao J., Dong Z., Li X., Wong K.P.",A general method for electricity market price spike analysis,2005,28.0,"Many techniques have been employed to forecast electricity market prices, and have achieved good results. These techniques mostly focus on normal price forecasting, not on the forecasting of price spikes. Data mining techniques have been successfully applied to forecast the value of price spikes under the condition that a spike appears. However, an effective method of predicting the occurrence of the spikes is yet to be seen. In this paper, a data mining based approach is presented to give a reliable forecast of the occurrence of price spikes. Combined with spike value prediction techniques, the proposed approach can give a comprehensive price spike forecasting. In this paper, data pre-process techniques are described to find the attributes relevant to the spikes. Then a simple introduction to the classification techniques is given for completeness.

"Romanchenko D., Odenberger M., Göransson L., Johnsson F.","Impact of electricity price fluctuations on the operation of district heating systems: A case study of district heating in GÖteborg, Sweden",2017,27.0,"This paper investigates the characteristics of interaction between district heating (DH) systems and the electricity system, induced by present and future price curves of the electricity system. A mixed integer linear programming unit commitment model has been developed with the objective of studying optimal operating strategies for DH systems. The model minimises the total operating cost of heat generation for a given DH system, which in this work is exemplified by the DH system of Göteborg, Sweden. The results should have important implications for operating strategies for DH systems as a response to future electricity price development. The results indicate significant changes in the operation of heat generation units in DH systems as a response to future electricity price profile with a, relative to today, high yearly average electricity price and more frequent high-electricity-price periods. The observed changes include a 20% decrease in heat generation from heat pumps (HP) and an increase of up to 25% in heat generation from combined heat and power (CHP) plants, owing to a switch in the merit order of these two technologies. We show that large fluctuations in the electricity price lead to an increased value being placed on CHP plants with variable power-to-heat ratio. The results indicate that with reoccurring high-electricity-price periods the value of sold electricity alone can become high enough to motivate investment in CHP plants, i.e. indicating that the generation and selling of heat from CHP plants may not be the core business in the future. Furthermore, there are additional opportunities for increased value of both CHP plants and HPs for time periods of less than 48 h, given that such short duration periods can be identified in a reasonable time in advance, i.e. dependent on, for instance, wind power forecasts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Combined heat and power (CHP); District heating (DH); Flexibility; Heat pumps (HP); Modelling; Optimisation,Cogeneration plants; Costs; Heat generation; Heat pump systems; Heating; Integer programming; Investments; Models; Wind power; Combined heat and power; District heating system; Electricity price fluctuation; Flexibility; Heat pumps; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimisations; Wind power forecast; District heating; business; combined heat and power; cost analysis; energy market; heat production; investment; linear programing; modeling; numerical model; operations technology; optimization; price dynamics; pump; wind power; Goteborg; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland; Chandipura virus,Article
"Gharesifard B., Başar T., Domínguez-García A.D.",Price-based coordinated aggregation of networked distributed energy resources,2016,27.0,"In this paper, we introduce a framework for studying the aggregated response for energy provision/consumption processes by distributed energy resources (DERs) that are physically connected to an electric power distribution network. In this framework, there is a set of agents referred to as aggregators that participate in a real-time energy market by submitting offers to sell, or bids to buy, a certain amount of energy at some price. To realize an offer or a bid, an aggregator interacts with a set of DERs and incentivizes them to produce (or consume) energy via some pricing strategy. In order to make a decision on whether or not to sell or buy energy, each DER uses the pricing information provided by the aggregator it is associated with, and some estimate of the average (or total) energy that neighboring DERs are willing to sell or buy, computed through some exchange of information among them through a cyber network; the topology of this cyber network is described by a connected undirected graph. The focus of this paper is on the DER strategic decision-making process, which we cast as a game with a single aggregator. In this context, we provide sufficient conditions on the aggregator's pricing strategy under which this game has a unique Nash equilibrium. Then, we propose a distributed algorithm that enables the DERs to seek this Nash equilibrium; this algorithm relies on simple computations using local information acquired through exchange of information with neighboring DERs. We illustrate our results through several numerical simulations. © 2015 IEEE.",Distributed energy resources; Distributed generation control; Distributed Nash seeking; Networked systems,Computation theory; Costs; Decision making; Electric power distribution; Game theory; Networked control systems; Sales; Topology; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed Nash seeking; Exchange of information; Local information; Networked systems; Pricing strategy; Strategic decision making; Undirected graph; Energy resources,Article
"Brijs T., De Vos K., De Jonghe C., Belmans R.",Statistical analysis of negative prices in European balancing markets,2015,27.0,"The presence of renewable power generation technologies increases the need for system flexibility due to their variable nature. The increasing share of variable renewables in European power systems create a downward adequacy problem, which deals with the ability of power systems to cope with periods of excess generation. The occurrence of negative prices on Central Western European electricity markets confirms the relevance of this issue, which is referred to as ""incompressibility of power systems"" and is assessed as a barrier for further renewable power integration. The objective of this article is to identify the main drivers of negative price periods in European balancing markets, by means of both an empirical and regression analysis. Results confirm a positive relation with the scheduled generation of renewables and inflexible base load, as well as a negative relation with the scheduled system load. Furthermore, the occurrence of negative prices is related to the positive and negative forecast error of renewable generation and demand, respectively. It is concluded that negative balancing market prices provide a market signal for investments in flexibility sources such as flexible generation, demand response, electricity storage, and interconnector capacity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Balancing market; Electricity prices; Market design; Negative prices; Renewable energy,Commerce; Costs; Electric energy storage; Investments; Regression analysis; Balancing market; Electricity prices; Market design; Negative prices; Renewable energies; Power markets; investment; market system; power generation; price dynamics; regression analysis; renewable resource; statistical analysis; Western Europe,Article
"Gullì F., Balbo A.L.",The impact of intermittently renewable energy on Italian wholesale electricity prices: Additional benefits or additional costs?,2015,27.0,"Most studies of the literature find that the development of renewable energy sources determines a decrease in the wholesale prices. Some authors use this finding to state that the current subsidies for renewable technologies cannot be considered as excessive. By carrying out a hybrid analysis (both simulation and ex-post empirical analyses) of the case of photovoltaic energy in Italy, this article demonstrates that this result cannot be generalised. Under market power, an increase in PV production can provide benefits in terms of a wholesale price decrease only beyond a specific threshold and especially if combined with other effects. Otherwise, it is likely that PV development could imply an increase in prices. Therefore, on the one hand, caution is necessary when using the estimated change in wholesale prices to evaluate the net cost for consumers of the supporting policies for renewables: either the simulation-based models or the full empirical analyses may be misleading. On the other hand, if ""decarbonisation"" is the main objective, the energy policies should be designed in order to assure a deep and balanced penetration of the clean technologies, regardless of their estimated transitory impact on wholesale prices (and in the meantime reviewing the organisation of power markets). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity; Market power; Prices; Renewable,Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Electricity; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Market Power; Photovoltaic energy; Prices; Renewable; Renewable energy source; Renewable technology; Simulation-based models; Wholesale electricity; Costs; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; photovoltaic system; price dynamics; renewable resource; Italy,Article
"Rubin O.D., Babcock B.A.",The impact of expansion of wind power capacity and pricing methods on the efficiency of deregulated electricity markets,2013,27.0,"The remarkable expansion of global wind power capacity in many countries brings forward several key economic questions regarding the performance of impacted electricity markets. Wind forecast uncertainties and rules that penalize scheduling deviations often discourage wind energy producers from participating in day-ahead electricity markets. Instead, wind energy commonly is priced either in the real-time balancing market or via a Feed-in-tariff (FIT) arrangement. In this paper we extend a recently developed equilibrium modeling approach to examine how the integration of wind energy impacts premiums in day-ahead electricity markets. In particular, we compare premiums as wind power capacity expands for different pricing mechanisms. By considering operational costs related to ramping conventional generators we are able to characterize the efficient level of premium needed to cope with the intermittent nature of wind. We find that the way that wind energy is priced is critical. We show that in the presence of imperfect competition pricing wind energy in the market increases firms' ability to extract oversized day-ahead premiums while in the case of market-independent FIT, market power is reduced as wind power capacity expands. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Cournot competition; Day-ahead premium; Deregulated electricity markets; Feed-in-tariff; Wind energy,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Weather forecasting; Conventional generators; Cournot competition; Day-ahead; Day-ahead electricity market; Deregulated electricity market; Equilibrium modeling; Feed-in tariff; Imperfect competition; Wind power; competition (economics); cost-benefit analysis; deregulation; electricity supply; energy efficiency; numerical model; pricing policy; renewable resource; tariff structure; wind power,Article

It provides useful information for the market players and the regulators, in both short and long run. Different approaches have been proposed and implemented. A new dynamic approach for forecasting the market price of electricity in the short term is proposed. The price dates are first clustered according to different types of daily profiles and then, given a proper function representing the trend in price, the set of unknown parameters are identified based on the zeroing of a Lyapunov function. The forecast can be dynamically updated with the latest data available. Higher weight can be attributed to this data in determining the future prices. The proposed approach is validated with reference to real systems in the form of the Italian, New England and New York electricity markets. In addition, an extensive price forecast is provided for the Italian market, an example of a young market that is rather difficult to predict patterns for. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2007.",,Costs; Data reduction; Lyapunov functions; Marketing; Dynamic approach; Market players; Price forecast; Electricity,Article

"Tahmasebifar R., Sheikh-El-Eslami M.K., Kheirollahi R.",Point and interval forecasting of real-time and day-ahead electricity prices by a novel hybrid approach,2017,26.0,"Accurate forecasting of electricity market prices presents important information to market participants. This provides forward planning of their bidding strategies in order to maximise revenue, profit, and utility perspectives. Nevertheless, due to the non-stationarities involved in market clearing price, an accurate forecasting of these prices is very complex. In this case, transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval ones is of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts. In this study, interval forecasting of market clearing prices is conducted based on a novel approach within two consecutive steps. In the first step, a new hybrid method is proposed to estimate point forecasts: combination of wavelet transformation (Wt), feature selection based on Mutual Information (MI), extreme learning machine (ELM), and bootstrap approaches in an ensemble structure is employed. The second step consists of the following stepwise parts: calculating the variance of the model uncertainties based on the extracted data from the ensemble structure, estimating the noise variance by using the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), and improving the accuracy of interval forecasting by using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach termed as Wt-mutual information-ELM-MLE-PSO is validated through electricity market real data of Australian electricity network from real-time and day-ahead market viewpoints. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Electric industry; Learning algorithms; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Uncertainty analysis; Australian electricities; Extreme learning machine; Interval forecasting; Market Clearing Price; Model uncertainties; Mutual informations; Particle swarm optimisation; Wavelet transformations; Forecasting,Article
"Gaudard L., Gabbi J., Bauder A., Romerio F.",Long-term Uncertainty of Hydropower Revenue Due to Climate Change and Electricity Prices,2016,26.0,"Hydropower represents the world’s largest renewable energy source. As a flexible technology, it enhances reliability and security of the electricity system. However, climate change and market liberalization may hinder investment due to the evolution of water runoffs and electricity prices. Both alter expected revenue and bring uncertainty. It increases risk and deters investment. Our research assesses how climate change and market fluctuation affect annual revenue. But this paper focuses on the uncertainty, rather than on forecasting. This transdisciplinary topic is investigated by means of a mixed method, i.e. both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative approach uses established models in natural sciences and economics. The uncertainty is accounted for by applying various scenarios and various datasets coming from different models. Based on those results, uncertainty is discussed through an analysis discerning three dimensions of uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis requires the assessment of a large panel of models and data sets. It is therefore rarely carried out. The originality of the paper also lies on the combination of quantitative established models with a qualitative analysis. The results surprisingly show that the greenhouse gas scenarios may in fact represent a low source of uncertainty, unlike electricity prices. Like forecasting, the main uncertainties are actually case study related and depend on the investigated variables. It is also shown that the nature of uncertainty evolves. Runoff uncertainty goes from variability, i.e. inherent randomness, to epistemic, i.e. limitation of science. The reverse situation occurs with the electricity price. The implications for scientists and policy makers are discussed. © 2016, The Author(s).",Electricity market liberalization; Mixed methodology; Mountain hydrology; three-dimensional uncertainty,Climate change; Commerce; Costs; Economics; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Runoff; Flexible technologies; Market fluctuations; Market liberalization; Mixed methodology; Mountain hydrology; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative approach; Renewable energy source; Uncertainty analysis; alternative energy; climate change; commodity price; electricity industry; hydroelectric power; investment; renewable resource; runoff; uncertainty analysis,Article
"Vasileva E., Viljainen S., Sulamaa P., Kuleshov D.",RES support in Russia: Impact on capacity and electricity market prices,2015,26.0,"Russian renewable energy policy has undergone changes following an establishment of targets for installed capacity and power production using renewable energy sources and the introduction of new capacity based support scheme for renewable energy. The forecasted amount of future renewable power will not provide enough power production to meet growing demand for renewable energy; although, it will help with modernization of the energy sector and development of renewable technology and innovation. At the same time, the capacity support scheme for renewable energy may adversely affect capacity prices and become an additional burden for industrial consumers, who are already paying the cost of capacity support for conventional power plants, so-called Capacity Delivery Agreements (CDAs). This work assesses the impact of the new capacity based support scheme on capacity and electricity price formation. Modeling results show that the impact of capacity support for renewable energy is small compared to that of capacity support for conventional energy, suggesting that the Russian energy production mix will continue to be dominated by fossil fuel based generation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Capacity market; Electricity price; Renewable support mechanisms; Russian RES policy,Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Industrial plants; Modernization; Capacity markets; Conventional power plants; Electricity prices; Industrial consumers; Renewable energy policy; Renewable energy source; Renewable technology; Support mechanism; Renewable energy resources; electrical power; energy policy; fossil fuel; future prospect; market system; power generation; renewable resource; Russian Federation,Article
"Mathaba T., Xia X., Zhang J.",Analysing the economic benefit of electricity price forecast in industrial load scheduling,2014,26.0,"The current trend of electricity market deregulation ushers in increasingly dynamic electricity pricing schemes. The cost-optimal scheduling of industrial loads with accurate price forecasts is therefore important. However, results in the current literature suggest that mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is poor at indicating the economic benefit of a forecast. This paper presents the economic benefit analysis of electricity price forecast on the day-ahead scheduling of load-shifting industrial plants. A coal-conveying system with storage is used as a case study. The research uses three price forecasting methods on the PJM's market prices over a period of two years. Rank correlation (RC) between the predicted price and the actual price is proposed as an indicator of economic benefit. The results show that RC is a better indicator of economic benefit than root mean square error (RMSE) and MAPE. They also show that potential economic benefit obtainable from forecasts depends on price volatility and not mean price. An artificial forecast is used to validate the superiority of RC over MAPE and RMSE. It is observed that the predictability of a forecast's economic benefit is largely dependent on how responsive the load is to electricity price changes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Conveyor belt system; Day-ahead scheduling; Demand-side management; Electricity cost optimization; Price forecast; Rank correlation,Belt conveyors; Coal storage; Demand side management; Deregulation; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric load forecasting; Forecasting; Mean square error; Power markets; Scheduling; Conveyor belt system; Day-ahead scheduling; Electricity costs; Price forecasts; Rank correlation; Costs,Article
"Cludius J., Forrest S., MacGill I.",Distributional effects of the Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET) through wholesale and retail electricity price impacts,2014,26.0,"The Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET) has spurred significant investment in renewable electricity generation, notably wind power, over the past decade. This paper considers distributional implications of the RET for different energy users. Using time-series regression, we show that the increasing amount of wind energy has placed considerable downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices through the so-called merit order effect. On the other hand, RET costs are passed on to consumers in the form of retail electricity price premiums. Our findings highlight likely significant redistributive transfers between different energy user classes under current RET arrangements. In particular, some energy-intensive industries are benefiting from lower wholesale electricity prices whilst being largely exempted from contributing to the costs of the scheme. By contrast, many households are paying significant RET pass through costs whilst not necessarily benefiting from lower wholesale prices. A more equitable distribution of RET costs and benefits could be achieved by reviewing the scope and extent of industry exemptions and ensuring that methodologies to estimate wholesale price components in regulated electricity tariffs reflect more closely actual market conditions. More generally, these findings support the growing international appreciation that policy makers need to integrate distributional assessments into policy design and implementation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Distributional effects; Electricity market; Renewable energy,Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Investments; Power markets; Wind power; Distributional effects; Electricity prices; Electricity tariff; Energy intensive industries; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Time-series regression; Wholesale electricity; Costs; alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy use; policy analysis; price dynamics; renewable resource; wind power; Australia,Article

"Karsaz A., Mashhadi H.R., Mirsalehi M.M.",Market clearing price and load forecasting using cooperative co-evolutionary approach,2010,26.0,"The deregulation of electric power supply industries has raised many challenging problems. One of the most important ones is forecasting the market clearing price (MCP) of electricity. Decisions on various issues, such as to buy or sell electricity and to offer a transaction to the market, require accurate knowledge of the MCP. Another problem, which has also been an important issue of the traditional power systems, is load forecasting for both short and long terms. In this paper, a new forecasting method is introduced to predict the next day electricity price and load. The proposed method is based on cooperative co-evolutionary (Co-Co) approach and has been applied to the real power market. Most of the conventional forecasting methods are based on a single neural network prediction. These methods might misrepresent parts of the input-output data mapping that could have been correctly represented by cooperation of multiple networks.

"Chang Z., Zhang Y., Chen W.",Electricity price prediction based on hybrid model of adam optimized LSTM neural network and wavelet transform,2019,25.0,"To a large extent, electricity price prediction is a daunting task because it depends on factors, such as weather, fuel, load and bidding strategies etc. Those features generate a lot of fluctuations to electricity price. As a type of RNN, LSTM has a good performance on processing time series data as well as some nonlinear and complex problems. To explore more accurate electricity price forecasting approach, in this paper, a new hybrid model based on wavelet transform and Adam optimized LSTM neural network, denoted as WT-Adam-LSTM, is proposed. After the wavelet transform, nonlinear sequence of electricity price can be decomposed and processed data will have a more stable variance, and the combination of Adam, one of efficient stochastic gradient-based optimizers, and LSTM can capture appropriate behaviors precisely for electricity price. This study presented four cases to verify the performance of the hybrid model, and the dataset from New South Wales of Australia and French were adopted to illustrate the excellence of the hybrid model. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. © 2019",Adam; Component; Electricity price prediction; Long short-term memory; Wavelet transform,Data handling; Forecasting; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Wavelet transforms; Adam; Bidding strategy; Component; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Nonlinear sequences; Prediction accuracy; Stochastic gradient; Long short-term memory,Article
"Saxena A., Soni B.P., Kumar R., Gupta V.",Intelligent Grey Wolf Optimizer – Development and application for strategic bidding in uniform price spot energy market,2018,25.0,"Restructuring of power system has enabled generating companies to sell the power in energy markets. To avail maximum profit, every generating company frame strategies and bid in competitive energy markets. Prediction of rival behavior and information of future energy price is a major difficulty, while exercising the profit making strategies. A powerful optimization tool is required to handle the profit maximization process in dynamically changing market; keeping this fact in consideration, a new variant of Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) named as Intelligent Grey Wolf Optimizer (IGWO) is proposed. This variant employs two mathematical frameworks first an efficient sinusoidal truncated function and another one is oppositional based learning concept for ensuring the better exploration and exploitation properties. The accuracy of IGWO is tested and compared with other contemporary algorithms on 22 benchmark functions. Once proved, the proposed algorithm is applied for framing bidding strategy in uniform and dynamically changing market conditions. The results of IGWO are compared with GWO, oppositional-GWO (OGWO) and PSO. The rivals behaviors are modeled through normal distribution of the bids and two cost models are prepared. Further, Monte Carlo simulations are performed. It is observed that profit obtained from IGWO is more from OGWO, GWO and PSO for both a single trading hour and a trading day. A considerable amount of profit can be earned by a generation company by employing proposed methodology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Bidding strategies; Electricity market; Grey wolf optimization; Market clearing price; Monte Carlo simulation,Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Functions; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Normal distribution; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Bidding strategy; Contemporary algorithms; Development and applications; Exploration and exploitation; Generating companies; Generation companies; Market Clearing Price; Mathematical frameworks; Power markets,Article
"Huang X., Hong S.H., Li Y.",Hour-Ahead Price Based Energy Management Scheme for Industrial Facilities,2017,25.0,"Price-based demand response (PBDR) offers a significant opportunity for electricity consumers to dynamically balance their energy demand in response to time-varying electricity prices, and therefore ease the burden on the grid during peak times. However, despite being the primary energy consumers, there is little research carried out on implementing PBDR in industrial facilities, especially on real-time price (RTP) based DR. In this study, we propose a DR scheme based on hour-ahead RTP for industrial facilities. The scheme implements an artificial neural network based price forecasting model to forecast unknown future prices to support global time horizon optimization. Based on the forecasting price, the energy cost minimization problem is formulated by mixed integer linear programming. This paper includes a practical case study of the whole process of steel powder manufacturing for performance analysis. The results show that the proposed scheme is capable of balancing the energy demand and reducing energy costs while satisfying production targets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Artificial neural network (ANN); demand response (DR); hour-ahead real-time price (HA-RTP); industrial facilities; price forecasting,Energy management; Forecasting; Industrial research; Integer programming; Neural networks; Power markets; Demand response; Electricity consumers; Energy management schemes; Industrial facilities; Mixed integer linear programming; Price forecasting; Real-time price; Time-varying electricity prices; Costs,Article

"Pereira A.J.C., Saraiva J.T.",Long term impact of wind power generation in the Iberian day-ahead electricity market price,2013,25.0,"The Iberian power systems went through important changes at the legal, regulatory and organizational levels in the last 20 years. One of the most relevant ones was the increasing penetration of distributed generation, namely wind parks, together with the development of the common market involving Portugal and Spain. In Portugal, distributed generation is paid using feed in tariffs while in Spain it can choose between receiving a regulated feed in tariff or the market price plus a participation prize. The feed in scheme is now under discussion since it is argued that it represents an excessive cost that is internalized in the end user tariffs. However, this discussion is frequently conducted without complete knowledge of the real impact of wind power on the electricity market price, since it contributes to reduce the demand on the market thus inducing a price reduction. To clarify these issues we used a long term System Dynamics based model already reported in a previous publication to estimate the long term evolution of the market price. This model was applied to the Iberian generation system using different shares of wind power capacity to quantify the impact of wind power on the day-ahead electricity market price. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity markets; Electricity price; Iberian electricity market; Long term impact; System Dynamics model; Wind power,Commerce; Distributed power generation; Electric industry; System theory; Wind power; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Iberian electricity market; Long-term impacts; System dynamics model; Costs; alternative energy; demand analysis; electricity industry; energy market; power generation; price dynamics; regulatory framework; renewable resource; wind farm; wind power; Iberian Peninsula,Article

We examine the effect of delays in consumers responding to price signals on the benefits of demand response in mitigating wind-uncertainty costs. Using a case study based on the ERCOT power system, we compare the cost of operating the system with forecasts of future wind availability to a best-case scenario with perfect foresight of wind. We demonstrate that wind uncertainty can impose substantive costs on the system and that demand response can eliminate more than 75% of these costs if loads respond to system conditions immediately. Otherwise, we find that with a 30-min lag in the response, nearly 72% of the value of demand response is lost. © 2013 IEEE.",Power system economics; Real-time pricing; Unit commitment; Wind forecast errors; Wind power generation,Effect of delays; Perfect foresights; Power system economics; Real time pricing; System conditions; Unit commitment; Wind forecasts; Wind uncertainties; Economics; Electric power generation; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Costs,Article

There are numerous practical difficulties in allowing financial mechanisms to direct investments and operations for the generation and distribution of electricity. The electric commodity must be generated, distributed and consumed in real-time under strict physical laws and extremely high reliability requirements. This process is far more exacting and complex then the distribution of traditional commodities, such as oil or agricultural products.

"van de Ven D.J., Fouquet R.",Historical energy price shocks and their changing effects on the economy,2017,24.0,"The purpose of this paper is to identify the changes in the impact of energy shocks on economic activity — with an interest in assessing if an economy's vulnerability and resilience to shocks improved with economic development. Using data on the United Kingdom over the last three hundred years, the paper identifies supply, aggregate demand and residual shocks to energy prices and estimates their changing influence on energy prices and GDP. The results suggest that the impacts of supply shocks rose with its increasing dependence on coal, and declined with its partial transition to oil. However, the transition from exporting coal to importing oil increased the negative impacts of demand shocks. More generally, the results indicate that improvements in vulnerability and resilience to shocks did not progress systematically as the economy developed. Instead, the changes in impacts depended greatly on the circumstances related to the demand for and supply of energy sources. If these experiences are transferable to future markets, a transition to a diversified mix of renewable energy is likely to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to energy price shocks. © 2017 The Authors",Demand shocks; Economic impact; Energy prices; Long run; Supply shocks,Costs; Economics; Demand shocks; Economic impacts; Energy prices; Long run; Supply shocks; Economic and social effects; demand elasticity; economic activity; economic development; economic impact; energy market; price dynamics; vulnerability; United Kingdom,Article
"Kekatos V., Giannakis G.B., Baldick R.",Grid topology identification using electricity prices,2014,24.0,"The potential of recovering the topology of a grid using solely publicly available market data is explored here. In contemporary whole-sale electricity markets, real-time prices are typically determined by solving the network-constrained economic dispatch problem. Under a linear DC model, locational marginal prices (LMPs) correspond to the Lagrange multipliers of the linear program involved. The interesting observation here is that the matrix of spatiotemporally varying LMPs exhibits the following property: Once premultiplied by the weighted grid Laplacian, it yields a low-rank and sparse matrix. Leveraging this rich structure, a regularized maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is developed to recover the grid Laplacian from the LMPs. The convex optimization problem formulated includes low rank-and sparsity-promoting regularizers, and it is solved using a scalable algorithm. Numerical tests on prices generated for the IEEE 14-bus benchmark provide encouraging topology recovery results. © 2014 IEEE.",alternating direction method of multipliers; compressed sensing; economic dispatch; graph Laplacian; locational marginal prices; Nuclear norm regularization,Commerce; Compressed sensing; Convex optimization; Costs; Lagrange multipliers; Laplace transforms; Linear programming; Matrix algebra; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Optimization; Recovery; Scheduling; Topology; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Economic Dispatch; Graph Laplacian; Locational marginal prices; Nuclear norm regularizations; Electric load dispatching,Conference Paper
"Cerjan M., Matijaš M., Delimar M.",Dynamic hybrid model for short-term electricity price forecasting,2014,24.0,"Accurate forecasting tools are essential in the operation of electric power systems, especially in deregulated electricity markets. Electricity price forecasting is necessary for all market participants to optimize their portfolios. In this paper we propose a hybrid method approach for short-term hourly electricity price forecasting. The paper combines statistical techniques for pre-processing of data and a multi-layer (MLP) neural network for forecasting electricity price and price spike detection. Based on statistical analysis, days are arranged into several categories. Similar days are examined by correlation significance of the historical data. Factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including historical price factors, load factors and wind production factors are discussed. A price spike index (CWI) is defined for spike detection and forecasting. Using proposed approach we created several forecasting models of diverse model complexity. The method is validated using the European Energy Exchange (EEX) electricity price data records.

We find substantial asymmetry when retailers pass on the impact of price changes in the wholesale market to the retail prices as price increases are transmitted more quickly than price decreases. By examining the cumulative adjustment function of price change, we identify that some dominant retailers might be exercising market power in the retail electricity market. For an average Norwegian household with variable price contract, the cost of asymmetric price pass-through due to 2.5. Øre/kWh change in the wholesale price over the complete life of pass-through in a year reaches to a high of 2.28 NOK. This cost sums up to 3.8 million NOK for all the Norwegian households on variable price contracts for one time price change.

"Anbazhagan S., Kumarappan N.",A neural network approach to day-ahead deregulated electricity market prices classification,2012,24.0,"This paper proposes a day-ahead electricity price classification that could be realized using three-layered feed forward neural network (FFNN), cascade-forward neural network (CFNN) trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The electricity price classification method is as an alternative to numerical electricity price forecasting due to high forecasting errors in various approaches. These electricity price classifications are important because all market participants do not know the exact value of future prices in their decision-making process. In this paper, various electricity market price classification classes with respect to pre specified electricity price thresholds are used. The simulation results show that the proposed CFNN method provides a robust and accurate method for day-ahead deregulated electricity market price classification classes.

In this paper the problem of modeling market clearing price forecasting in deregulated markets is studied. And electricity price forecasting with support vector machines based on time series is provided. Except considering MCP price influential factors such as previous competitive load, making-up price, competitive generating capacity etc, the past price data which are time series style or not have been included as attributes in input parameters. That is to introduce the concept of time series into our presented model. Based on these influential factors, the corresponding SVM forecasting model is presented.

Cramton P.,Competitive bidding behavior in uniform-price auction markets,2004,24.0,"Profit-maximizing bidding in uniform price auction markets involves bidding above marginal cost. It therefore is not surprising that such behavior is observed in electricity markets. This incentive to bid above marginal cost is not the result of coordinated action among the bidders. Rather, each bidder is independently selecting its bid to maximize profits based on its estimate of the residual demand curve it faces. The supplier bids a price for its energy capacity to optimize its marginal tradeoff between higher prices and lower quantities. Price response from either demand or other suppliers prevents the supplier from raising its bid too much. Profit maximizing bidding should be expected and encouraged by regulators. It is precisely this profit maximizing behavior that guides the market toward long-run efficient outcomes.",,Competition; Electric industry; Electric rates; Marketing; Optimization; Problem solving; Auction markets; Competitive bidding; Energy capacity; Profit maximizing bidding; Industrial economics,Conference Paper
"Mujeeb S., Javaid N., Ilahi M., Wadud Z., Ishmanov F., Afzal M.K.",Deep long short-term memory: A new price and load forecasting scheme for big data in smart cities,2019,23.0,"This paper focuses on analytics of an extremely large dataset of smart grid electricity price and load, which is difficult to process with conventional computational models. These data are known as energy big data. The analysis of big data divulges the deeper insights that help experts in the improvement of smart grid's (SG) operations. Processing and extracting of meaningful information from data is a challenging task. Electricity load and price are the most influential factors in the electricity market. For improving reliability, control and management of electricity market operations, an exact estimate of the day ahead load is a substantial requirement. Energy market trade is based on price. Accurate price forecast enables energy market participants to make effective and most profitable bidding strategies. This paper proposes a deep learning-based model for the forecast of price and demand for big data using Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM). Due to the adaptive and automatic feature learning mechanism of Deep Neural Network (DNN), the processing of big data is easier with LSTM as compared to the purely data-driven methods. The proposed model was evaluated using well-known real electricity markets' data. In this study, day and week ahead forecasting experiments were conducted for all months. Forecast performance was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). The proposed Deep LSTM (DLSTM) method was compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) time series forecasting methods, i.e., Nonlinear Autoregressive network with Exogenous variables (NARX) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). DLSTM outperformed the compared forecasting methods in terms of accuracy. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method for electricity price and load forecasting. © 2019 by the authors.",Big data; Electricity load; Long Short-Term Memory LSTM; Price forecasting; Smart grid,artificial neural network; data set; electricity; energy market; forecasting method; price determination; profitability; smart city,Article
"Bello A., Bunn D.W., Reneses J., Munoz A.",Medium-Term Probabilistic Forecasting of Electricity Prices: A Hybrid Approach,2017,23.0,"This paper provides a focus upon forecasting electricity prices in the medium term (from a few weeks to several months ahead) in which accurate estimates of tail risks, e.g., at the 1%, 5%, 95%, and 99%, are important. Medium term forecasting and risk analysis are important for operational scheduling, fuel purchasing, trading, and profit management. We extend the research on hybrid forecasting methods, which link detailed fundamental price formation models, using optimization techniques and market equilibrium considerations, with econometric recalibration to the time series data. This paper is innovative in its use of quantile regression to undertake the recalibration and provide accurate risk estimates. It is shown that probabilistic outputs from the fundamental model add value over expected value inputs to the quantile regressions and that if the fundamental model is itself well specified to diurnal variation through the inclusion of relevant explanatory variables such as demand or climatic conditions, then it is not necessary to undertake the quantile regressions separately for each hour of the day. A real application of the proposed methodology is successfully tested on the Spanish electric power system, in which the high penetration of intermittent wind generation creates extreme price risks. The hybrid method outperforms the more conventional fundamental model, making particular use of wind generation data in the quantile recalibrations. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Electricity prices; fundamentals; hybrid model; probabilistic forecasting; quantile regression,Commerce; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Scheduling; Electricity prices; fundamentals; Hybrid model; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile regression; Costs,Article
"Hagfors L.I., Bunn D., Kristoffersen E., Staver T.T., Westgaard S.",Modeling the UK electricity price distributions using quantile regression,2016,23.0,"In this paper we develop fundamental quantile regression models for the UK electricity price in each trading period. Intraday properties of price risk, as represented by the predictive distribution rather than expected values, have previously not been fully analyzed. The sample covers half hourly data from 2005 to 2012. From our analysis we are able to show how the sensitivity towards different fundamental factors changes across quantiles and time of day. In the UK the supply of electricity is to a large extent generated from coal and gas plants, thus the price of gas and coal, as well as the carbon emission price, are included as fundamental factors in our model. We also include the electricity price lagged by one day, as well as demand and margin forecasts. We find that the sensitivities vary across the price distribution. Our findings also suggest that the sensitivity to fundamental factors exhibit intraday variation. We find that the sensitivity to gas relative to coal is higher in high quantiles and lower in low quantiles, as well as some indications of market power being exercised during peak hours. We have demonstrated a scenario analysis based on the quantile regression models, showing how changes in the values of the fundamentals influence the electricity price distribution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity markets; Prices; Quantile regression; Risk,Carbon; Coal; Commerce; Gas plants; Power markets; Regression analysis; Risks; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon emission prices; Electricity prices; Expected values; Predictive distributions; Prices; Quantile regression; Scenario analysis; Trading periods; Costs; carbon emission; demand analysis; energy market; power generation; price dynamics; pricing policy; regression analysis; risk assessment; United Kingdom,Article

"Malakar T., Goswami S.K., Sinha A.K.",Impact of load management on the energy management strategy of a wind-short hydro hybrid system in frequency based pricing,2014,23.0,"In the post restructuring era of electrical power system, each of the generating farm or utility has its own business strategy in terms of generation planning, load management and for other decisions. The basic objective of the utility is to maximize the operational profit for a given period of time. Generation scheduling for a utility with wind farm largely depends on the accuracy of wind power prediction. Therefore, it is important to explore the suitability of load management approach in coordination with the use of energy storage facility to compensate the uncertainty in wind power generation. This paper focuses mainly the operating strategy of a grid connected small hybrid power system to maximize its profit by adopting coordination between load management technique and utilization of storage plant under frequency based pricing. The optimum load scheduling has been implemented to utilities own local load. An hourly-discretized optimization algorithm is proposed and solved using artificial bee colony algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the optimization problem is solved for varied wind power scenarios with different demand expectations cases in a day ahead Indian electricity market. It is noted that the proposed load management approach results more profit for the hybrid system because of better power management compared to the case when load scheduling has not been incorporated. The solution of the proposed optimization algorithm gives the strategies to be followed by the hybrid system how to operate its pump storage unit and to serve its local load in next hours. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Huisman R., Kiliç M.",A history of European electricity day-ahead prices,2013,23.0,"In this article, we examine the development of day-ahead prices in five European markets which became more connected over recent years. Where previous studies examined the convergence of price levels over time, we focus on patterns in estimates for the parameters in a switching regimes model. This makes it possible to distinguish between prices under normal market conditions and under non-normal market conditions, those market conditions that can cause extreme price spikes. We expect that increased connectivity yields additional supply in the short-term and therefore will reduce the impact of price spikes. Our results indicate that the impact of price spikes and volatility decreased over time, that prices behave more random, and that the parameter estimates between various connected markets seem to have converged between the Belgian, Dutch, French, German and Nordic day-ahead markets over the years 2003 through 2010.

"Ma Y., Luh P.B., Kasiviswanathan K., Ni E.",A neural network-based method for forecasting zonal locational marginal prices,2004,23.0,"To direct market participants to make efficient use of both transmission and generation resources, energy for both day-ahead and real-time markets is priced by Locational Marginal Price (LMP). Good LMP forecasting will help market participants make effective decisions when preparing offers and bids and making bilateral contracts. LMP forecasting, however, is difficult since LMPs are closely affected by complicated market behaviors and depend heavily on transmission congestions. This paper presents a neural network-based method for forecasting zonal LMPs by using the Decoupled Extend Kalman Filter (DEKF) with UD factorization and sequential updating. Congestion components are emphasized by forecasting differences between zonal LMPs and hub LMPs, and the hub LMPs themselves are forecasted by their logarithm to better reflect market behaviors. A method is also developed to capture system transmission outages. To overcome the unavailability of zonal loads, a method is developed to predict zonal loads based on the total load.

"Marcjasz G., Uniejewski B., Weron R.",On the importance of the long-term seasonal component in day-ahead electricity price forecasting with NARX neural networks,2019,22.0,"Daily and weekly seasonalities are always taken into account in day-ahead electricity price forecasting, but the long-term seasonal component has long been believed to add unnecessary complexity, and hence, most studies have ignored it. The recent introduction of the Seasonal Component AutoRegressive (SCAR) modeling framework has changed this viewpoint. However, this framework is based on linear models estimated using ordinary least squares. This paper shows that considering non-linear autoregressive (NARX) neural network-type models with the same inputs as the corresponding SCAR-type models can lead to yet better performances. While individual Seasonal Component Artificial Neural Network (SCANN) models are generally worse than the corresponding SCAR-type structures, we provide empirical evidence that committee machines of SCANN networks can outperform the latter significantly. © 2017 International Institute of Forecasters",Committee machine; Day-ahead market; Electricity spot price; Forecasting; Long-term seasonal component; NARX neural network,,Article
"Afkhami M., Cormack L., Ghoddusi H.",Google search keywords that best predict energy price volatility,2017,22.0,"Internet search activity data has been widely used as an instrument to approximate trader attention in different markets. This method has proven effective in predicting market indices in the short-term. However, little attention has been paid to demonstrating search activity for keywords that best grab investor attention in different markets. This study attempts to build the best practically possible proxy for attention in the market for energy commodities using Google search data. Specifically, we confirm the utility of Google search activity for energy related keywords are significant predictors of volatility by showing they have incremental predictive power beyond the conventional GARCH models in predicting volatility for energy commodities' prices. Starting with a set of ninety terms used in the energy sector, the study uses a multistage filtering process to create combinations of keywords that best predict the volatility of crude oil (Brent and West Texas Intermediate), conventional gasoline (New York Harbor and US Gulf Coast), heating oil (New York Harbor), and natural gas prices. For each commodity, combinations that enhance GARCH most effectively are established as proxies of attention. The results indicate investor attention is widely reflected in Internet search activities and demonstrate search data for what keywords best reveal the direction of concern and attention in energy markets. © 2017",Energy market; Energy price volatility; Google search activity; Volatility prediction,Commerce; Costs; Crude oil; Filtration; Forecasting; Information retrieval; Investments; Natural gas; Power markets; Conventional gasoline; Energy markets; Energy price volatilities; Internet searches; Multistage filtering; Natural gas price; Search activity; West texas intermediates; Search engines,Article
"Mirakyan A., Meyer-Renschhausen M., Koch A.","Composite forecasting approach, application for next-day electricity price forecasting",2017,22.0,"Accurate forecasting of electricity prices can provide significant benefits to energy suppliers when allocating their assets and to energy consumers for defining an optimal portfolio. There are numerous methods that efficiently support the forecasting of time series, such as electricity prices, which have high volatility. However, the performance of these approaches varies depending on data sets and operational conditions. In this work, the concept of composite forecasting is presented and implemented in a retrospective study, in real industrial forecasting conditions to show the potential of forecast performance improvement and comparable high consistency of a forecast performance across different ‘Day Peak’ and ‘Day Base’ electricity price data sets for different seasons. As individual methods support vector regression, artificial neural networks and ridge regression are implemented. The forecast performances of these methods are evaluated and compared with their forecast combination using different error measures. The results show that composite forecasting processes with ‘inverse root mean squared error’ combination approach can generate, on average, a more accurate and robust forecast than using an individual methods or other combination schemas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Combined forecast; Computational intelligence; Energy; Forecasting; Modelling,Artificial intelligence; Costs; Forecasting; Inverse problems; Models; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Combination approaches; Combined forecasts; Electricity price forecasting; Energy; Industrial forecasting; Operational conditions; Root mean squared errors; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets; data set; electricity supply; energy use; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; price dynamics; regression analysis,Article
"Shao Z., Yang S., Gao F., Zhou K., Lin P.",A new electricity price prediction strategy using mutual information-based SVM-RFE classification,2017,22.0,"Owing to the central role in electricity market operation, researchers have long sought to investigate the price responsiveness of both electricity supply and consumption sides. From the perspective of demand-side management (DSM), electricity prices prediction can be regarded as a pattern recognition problem of classifying future electricity prices with respect to a predefined threshold. From a fresh perspective this paper develops an efficient framework, called TSS-RFE-MRMR based SVM (Time series segmentation, recursive feature elimination, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance based support vector machine), for providing estimates of price fluctuation over certain valuation domains and modeling high-dimensional electricity market price without adopting additional impact factors. It starts from adopting a novel feature space determination scheme, called principal component analysis-dynamic programming (PCA-DP) based time series segmentation. Then, the RFE-MRMR filter for significant features selection is implemented, where both redundant and less relevant features are progressively eliminated among the potential feature sets. To test the performance of the proposed approach, it is evaluated on Ontario and New York electricity markets and compared with other method. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other traditional method and present a relatively higher prediction accuracy on the electricity price. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity market price prediction; Minimum redundancy maximum relevancy; Pattern classification; SVM-RFE; Time series segmentation,Classification (of information); Commerce; Dynamic programming; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Pattern recognition; Power markets; Principal component analysis; Redundancy; Support vector machines; Time series; Time series analysis; Electricity market operations; Market price; Minimum redundancy maximum relevancy; Minimum redundancy-maximum relevances; Pattern recognition problems; Recursive feature elimination; SVM-RFE; Time-series segmentation; Costs,Review
"Bello A., Reneses J., Muñoz A., Delgadillo A.",Probabilistic forecasting of hourly electricity prices in the medium-term using spatial interpolation techniques,2016,22.0,"In the context of competitive electricity markets, medium-term price forecasting is essential for market stakeholders. However, very little research has been conducted in this field, in contrast to short-term price forecasting. Previous studies of electricity price forecasting have tackled the problem of medium-term prediction using fundamental market equilibrium models with daily data, or at most, averages of groups of hours. Similarly, the limitations of point forecasts are recognized widely, but the literature dealing with probabilistic forecasts is sparse. In this study, a novel methodology for the medium-term hourly forecasting of electricity prices is proposed. This methodology is unique in the sense that it also attempts to perform punctual and probabilistic hourly predictions simultaneously. The approach consists of a nested combination of several modeling stages. The first stage consists of generating multiple scenarios of uncertain variables. In a second stage, a market equilibrium model that incorporates Monte Carlo simulation and a new definition of load levels is executed for a reduced combination of the scenarios generated. The application of spatial interpolation techniques allows us to estimate numerous feasible realizations of electricity prices from only several hundred executions of the fundamental market equilibrium model without any loss of accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is verified in a real-size electricity system that is characterized by complex price dynamics: the Spanish market. © 2015 International Institute of Forecasters",Electricity prices; Medium-term hourly prediction; Medium-term probabilistic forecasting; Monte Carlo simulation,,Article
"He K., Yu L., Tang L.",Electricity price forecasting with a BED (Bivariate EMD Denoising) methodology,2015,22.0,"The forecasting of electricity price remains the subject of increasingly intense research attention as the market structure becomes more complicated with the deregulation waves and the increasing level of price fluctuations observed. The heterogeneous data structure revealed in the recent empirical studies serves as the important stylized fact to be explored and analyzed in the heterogeneous market structure framework. Facing the increasingly diversified and more integrated market environment, the forecasting model in the electricity markets needs to take into account the individual and inter dependent heterogeneity features such as noises. In this paper, under the proposed HMH (Heterogeneous Market Hypothesis), we propose a BED (Bivariate EMD Denoising) based forecasting methodology to track and predict the electricity price movement. The BED algorithm is introduced as the feature extraction tool to identify and remove the noises, where the Error Entropy is further used as the criteria to determine the optimal level in EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) to be shrinkaged.

"Andrade J.R., Filipe J., Reis M., Bessa R.J.",Probabilistic price forecasting for day-ahead and intraday markets: Beyond the statistical model,2017,21.0,"Forecasting the hourly spot price of day-ahead and intraday markets is particularly challenging in electric power systems characterized by high installed capacity of renewable energy technologies. In particular, periods with low and high price levels are difficult to predict due to a limited number of representative cases in the historical dataset, which leads to forecast bias problems and wide forecast intervals. Moreover, these markets also require the inclusion of multiple explanatory variables, which increases the complexity of the model without guaranteeing a forecasting skill improvement. This paper explores information from daily futures contract trading and forecast of the daily average spot price to correct point and probabilistic forecasting bias. It also shows that an adequate choice of explanatory variables and use of simple models like linear quantile regression can lead to highly accurate spot price point and probabilistic forecasts. In terms of point forecast, the mean absolute error was 3.03 €/MWh for day-ahead market and a maximum value of 2.53 €/MWh was obtained for intraday session 6. The probabilistic forecast results show sharp forecast intervals and deviations from perfect calibration below 7% for all market sessions. © 2017 by the authors.",Electricity market; Feature engineering; Intraday; Price forecasting; Statistical learning; Uncertainty,complexity; electrical power; energy market; energy resource; market conditions; numerical model; price dynamics; renewable resource; statistical analysis; uncertainty analysis,Article

"Xie D., Hui H., Ding Y., Lin Z.",Operating reserve capacity evaluation of aggregated heterogeneous TCLs with price signals,2018,20.0,"Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) have been studied to provide operating reserve for maintaining power balance between supply and demand. However, operating reserve capacity (ORC) supplied by aggregated TCLs is difficult to evaluate, due to the insufficient information of heterogeneous TCLs and consumer behaviors. This paper proposes a quantitative ORC evaluation method for large-scale aggregated heterogeneous TCLs without sufficient measurement data. Firstly, an individual TCL model on account of consumer behaviors is developed to characterize the impact of fluctuated electricity prices and different thermal comfort requirements. Secondly, a novel optimization model of heterogeneous TCLs, which can guarantee consumer satisfaction, is proposed to provide operating reserve for power systems. Thirdly, the probability density estimation (PDE) method is developed to evaluate the ORC provided by large-scale heterogeneous TCLs with insufficient data.

"Sato M., Dechezleprêtre A.",Asymmetric industrial energy prices and international trade,2015,20.0,"This paper measures the response of bilateral trade flows to differences in industrial energy prices across countries. Using a rich panel dataset with 42 countries, 62 manufacturing sectors over 16 years (1996-2011) and covering 60% of global merchandise trade, we estimate the short-run effects of sector-level energy price asymmetry on trade. We find that changes in relative energy prices have a statistically significant but very small impact on imports. On average, a 10% increase in the energy price difference between two country-sectors increases imports by 0.2%. The impact is larger for energy-intensive sectors. Even in these sectors, however, the magnitude of the effect is such that changes in energy price differences across time explain less than 0.01% of the variation in trade flows.

Elattar E.E.,Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets based on local informative vector machine,2013,20.0,"In a competitive electricity market, short-term electricity price forecasting are very important for market participants. Electricity price is a very complex signal as a result of its non-linearity, non-stationarity and time-variant behaviour. This study presents a new approach to short-term electricity price forecasting. The proposed method is derived by integrating the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method with the local informative vector machine (IVM), which can be derived by combining the IVM with the local regression method. IVM is a practical probabilistic alternative to the popular support vector machine. Local prediction makes use of similar historical data patterns in the reconstructed space to train the regression algorithm. In the proposed method, KPCA is used to extract features of the inputs and obtain kernel principal components for constructing the phase space of the time series of the inputs. Then local IVM is employed to solve the price forecasting problem. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world dataset. The results show that the proposed method can improve the price forecasting accuracy and provides a much better prediction performance in comparison with other 12 recently published approaches. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",,Competitive electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Informative vector machines; Kernel principal component; Kernel principal component analyses (KPCA); Market participants; Prediction performance; Regression algorithms; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Image retrieval; Phase space methods; Principal component analysis; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Forecasting,Article

"Valenzuela J., Mazumdar M.",On the computation of the probability distribution of the spot market price in a deregulated electricity market,2001,20.0,"In a deregulated electricity market, short- and long-term decisions will be based on the spot price of electricity rather than on the load. The hourly spot prices of electricity have so far shown evidence of being highly volatile. In this paper, we propose a stochastic model for the spot market price of electricity in which no historical data for the prices are required. Rather than directly modeling the price, we model the underlying stochastic processes of the marginal unit that determines the price of electricity under market competition. The deregulated market of electricity is still evolving and the set of generating units participating in a particular market can be constantly changing. A model that uses historically observed market prices may thus give inaccurate predictions. Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to collect empirical data to obtain an accurate forecast for the spot market price. Our price model represents the market by a power generation system and captures its fundamenta l stochastic characteristics. This model highlights the dependence of the price on temperature fluctuations. The model is also used to provide analytical approximations to the bivariate probability distribution of the spot prices at two different hours.",Deregulation; Electricity; Marginal unit; Monte carlo; Power generation; Production costing models; Spot price; Stochastic models,Costs; Economics; Electric loads; Electric losses; Electric power generation; Mathematical models; Probability distributions; Deregulated electricity markets; Electric utilities,Conference Paper

In this paper, we consider the problem of understanding how fundamental drivers impact the probability of extreme price occurrences in the German day-ahead electricity market. We develop models using fundamental variables to predict the probability of extreme prices. The dynamics of negative prices and positive price spikes differ greatly. Positive spikes are related to high demand, low supply and high prices the previous days, and mainly occur during the morning and afternoon peak hours. Negative prices occur mainly during the night and are closely related to low demand combined with high wind production levels. Furthermore, we do a closer analysis of how renewable energy sources, hereby photovoltaic and wind power, impact the probability of negative prices and positive spikes. The models confirm that extremely high and negative prices have different drivers, and that wind power is particularly important in relation to negative price occurrences. The models capture the main drivers of both positive and negative extreme price occurrences and perform well with respect to accurately forecasting the probability with high levels of confidence.

"Luoma J., Mathiesen P., Kleissl J.",Forecast value considering energy pricing in California,2014,19.0,"In this study, production forecast value is investigated using day-ahead market (DAM) and real-time market (RTM) locational marginal prices (LMP) at 63 sites in California. Using the North American Mesoscale (NAM) Model, day-ahead global horizontal irradiance (GHI) forecasts are established and converted to power assuming that a 1. MW solar photovoltaic plant is co-located at each observation site. Using this forecast, energy is hypothetically sold in the DAM. As the RTM occurs, deviations between forecast and observation are settled by hypothetically purchasing or selling energy at the RTM price. Total revenue is calculated by the sum of these two transactions. Comparison of NAM forecast revenue to perfect day-ahead forecast revenue shows that perfect forecast revenue is always greater. However, yearly NAM forecast revenue is as much as 98% of the perfect forecast revenue for some sites. After a bias-correction is applied to NAM forecasts, NAM forecast revenue decreases. This demonstrates that based on the observed DAM-RTM price spread, biased forecasts can have a higher forecast value than more accurate forecasts. However, when a deviation penalty is assessed, the most accurate forecasts always yield the highest total revenue. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Energy market; Energy prices; Forecast value; Solar energy,Commerce; Costs; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Bias correction; Day ahead market; Energy markets; Energy prices; Locational marginal prices; Production forecasts; Real-time market; Solar photovoltaic plants; Forecasting; accuracy assessment; economic analysis; energy policy; forecasting method; numerical model; photovoltaic system; pricing policy; real time; solar power; California; United States,Article

Given the importance of the CC auction in the field, it is highly desirable to understand whether there are efficient versions of the CC auction providing a strong game theoretical solution concept. So far, equilibrium strategies have only been found for combinatorial auctions with nonlinear and personalized prices for very restricted sets of bidder valuations. We introduce an extension of the CC auction, the CCC auction, and show that it actually leads to efficient outcomes in an ex post equilibrium for general valuations with only linear ask prices. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the worst case efficiency of the CC auction, which highlights situations in which the CC leads to highly inefficient outcomes. As in other theoretical models of combinatorial auctions, bidders in the field might not be able to follow the equilibrium strategies suggested by the game-theoretical predictions. Therefore, we complement the theoretical findings with results from computational and laboratory experiments using realistic value models. The experimental results illustrate that the CCC auction can have a significant impact on efficiency compared to the CC auction. © 2013 INFORMS.",Allocative efficiency; Combinatorial auction; Electronic market,Clocks; Commerce; Costs; Allocative efficiency; Combinatorial auction; Computational analysis; Electronic market; Equilibrium bidding strategies; Laboratory experiments; Theoretical solutions; Worst-case efficiency; Game theory,Article
Ullrich C.J.,Realized volatility and price spikes in electricity markets: The importance of observation frequency,2012,19.0,"This paper uses high frequency spot price data from eight wholesale electricity markets in Australia, Canada, and the United States to estimate realized volatility and the frequency of price spikes. I find similar levels of realized volatility in Australia and North America, with estimates ranging from 1500% to 2700%, much greater than estimates reported previously in the literature. In hourly data, the frequency of price spikes ranges from approximately 35% to 40% in seven of eight markets.

To this end, we consider a panel of 35 maturities and control for the economic and financial environment using equity futures prices. Estimating the cointegrating relationship, we find that oil, gas and coal forward prices are positively linked, while the negative link between oil and electricity prices is consistent with a substitution effect between the two energy sources on the long run. Estimating panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) models, we show that the forward oil price adjustment process toward its equilibrium value is nonlinear and asymmetric, putting forward the key role played by self-sustaining dynamics and speculation phenomena. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Forward energy prices; Nonlinear model; Panel cointegration; PSTR; Speculation,Forward energy; Non-linear model; Panel cointegration; PSTR; Speculation; Economics; Energy resources; Costs; cointegration analysis; commodity price; energy market; numerical model; price dynamics; regression analysis,Article
"Roozbehanit M., Rinehart M., Dahleh M.A., Mitter S.K., Obradovic D., Mangesius H.",Analysis of competitive electricity markets under a new model of real-time retail pricing,2011,19.0,"In this paper, we propose a new real-time retail pricing model characterized by ex-post adjustments to exanté price, and investigate the stability and efficiency properties of the resulting closed loop system. Under this pricing mechanism, electricity is priced at the exanté price (calculated based on predicted demand) up to the amount consumed at the previous time period. Any deviation of the demand from the previous time period is penalized or reimbursed at the ex-post price (calculated based on actual demand, after consumption). It is assumed that the exanté and ex-post prices are calculated based on the aggregate consumption of the population. Therefore, although an individual consumer is a price-taker, he might adjust his behavior strategically based on the mean consumption of the population. Within this class of pricing mechanisms we investigate the social welfare and price stability properties. Simulation is used to show that the approximate dynamics with individual-mass interaction has better stability and robustness properties than pure exanté pricing. © 2011 IEEE.",Economic Efficiency; Market Stability; Real-Time Pricing,Aggregate consumption; Competitive electricity markets; Economic efficiency; Market stability; New model; Price stability; Pricing mechanism; Pricing models; Real time pricing; Social welfare; Stability and robustness; Time-periods; Closed loop systems; Commerce; Large scale systems; Stability; Costs,Conference Paper

Facing that reality, price forecasting has an increasing impact in agents' activity. The success on bidding strategies or on price negotiation for bilateral contracts is directly dependent on the accuracy of the price forecast. However, taking decisions based only on a single forecasted value is not a good practice in risk management. The work presented in this paper makes use of artificial neural networks to find the market price for a given period, with a certain confidence level. Historical information was used to train the neural networks and the number of neural networks used is dependent of the number of clusters found on that data.

When the option of selling or buying electric power at spot market prices is included in unit commitment decisions, the optimal solution of a UCP with M units under standard operating and load constraints can be obtained by solving M uncoupled sub-problems. We account for the volatility of the spot market price of electricity by using a stochastic model. The model incorporates both the stochastic features of the availabilities of generating units participating in the market and the uncertainty of the aggregate load. We use probabilistic dynamic programming to solve the stochastic optimization problem. We show that for a market of 150 units the unit commitment problem can be accurately solved in a reasonable time by using the normal, Edgeworth, or Monte Carlo approximation methods for estimating the needed probability distributions.",Deregulation; Monte carlo; Spot price; Stochastic models; Unit commitment,Decision support systems; Deregulation; Dynamic programming; Electric power generation; Marketing; Monte Carlo methods; Operations research; Optimization; Probability distributions; Stochastic programming; Edgeworth approximation method; Spot market price; Stochastic models; Unit commitment decisions; Electric power systems,Conference Paper

"Maciejowska K., Nitka W., Weron T.",Day-ahead vs. Intraday—Forecasting the price spread to maximize economic benefits,2019,18.0,"Recently, a dynamic development of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) has been observed. In order to allow for the adoption of trading contracts for unplanned events and changing weather conditions, the day-ahead markets have been complemented by intraday markets; in some countries, such as Poland, balancing markets are used for this purpose. This research focuses on a small RES generator, which has no market power and sells electricity through a larger trading company. The generator needs to decide, in advance, how much electricity is sold in the day-ahead market. The optimal decision of the generator on where to sell the production depends on the relation between prices in different markets. Unfortunately, when making the decision, the generator is not sure which market will offer a higher price. This article investigates the possible gains from utilizing forecasts of the price spread between the intraday/balancing and day-ahead markets in the decision process. It shows that the sign of the price spread can be successfully predicted with econometric models, such as ARX and probit. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the statistical measures of forecast accuracy, such as the percentage of correct sign classifications, do not necessarily coincide with economic benefits. © 2019 by the authors.",ARX model; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Forecasting; Price spread; Probit model,Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Renewable energy resources; ARX model; Dynamic development; Electricity prices; Forecast accuracy; Price spread; Probit models; Renewable energy source; Statistical measures; Power markets,Article

More importantly, evidence on the out-of-sample predictability reinforces the value of the specifications, as the forecast quality is improved over the benchmark EGARCH model under eight conventional criteria. In particular, we show that the benefit of including intraday range as a realized measure is more substantial than realized variance.

"Aggarwal S.K., Saini L.M., Kumar A.",Price forecasting using wavelet transform and LSE based mixed model in Australian electricity market,2008,18.0,"Purpose - Price forecasting is essential for risk management in deregulated electricity markets. The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid technique using wavelet transform (WT) and multiple linear regression (MLR) to forecast price profile in electricity markets. Design/methodology/approach - Price series is highly volatile and non-stationary in nature. In this work, initially complete price series has been decomposed into separate 48 half-hourly series and then these series have been categorized into different segments for price forecasting. For some segments, WT based MLR has been applied and for the other segments, simple MLR model has been applied. The model is general in nature and has been implemented for one day-ahead price forecasting in National Electricity Market (NEM) of Australia. Participants can use the technique practically, since it predicts price well before submission of bids. Findings - Forecasting performance of the proposed WT and MLR based mixed model has been compared with the three other models, an analytical model, a MLR model and an artificial neural network (ANN) based model. The proposed model was found to be better. Performance evaluation for different wavelets was performed, and it has been observed that for improving forecasting accuracy using WT, Daubechies wavelet of order two gives the best performance. Originality/value - Forecasting accuracy improvement of an established technique by incorporating time domain and wavelet domain variables of the same time series into one set has been implemented in this work. The paper also attempts to explain how non-stationarity can be removed from a non-stationary time series by applying WT after appropriate statistical investigation. Moreover, real time electricity markets are highly unpredictable and yet under investigated. The model has been applied to NEM for the same reason. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Australia; Correlation analysis; Demand forecasting; Electricity industry; Financial forecasting; Volatility,Backpropagation; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electricity; Forecasting; Fourier transforms; Marketing; Network performance; Neural networks; Risk analysis; Risk management; Time series; Wavelet transforms; Australia; Correlation analysis; Demand forecasting; Electricity industry; Financial forecasting; Volatility; Electric load forecasting,Article
"Li Y., Flynn P.C.",Deregulated power prices: Comparison of diurnal patterns,2004,18.0,"We examine electrical power price, and in particular its daily and average weekday vs. weekend pattern of change, for 14 deregulated markets. Power price in deregulated markets shows fundamentally different patterns. North American markets show a monotonic diurnal weekday price pattern, while all other markets studied show more than one price peak. Deregulated power markets differ in maximum vs. minimum daily average price and in average weekday to weekend price, in turn creating a different incentive for a consumer to time shift power consuming activities. Markets differ in the extent to which a small fraction of the days shapes the average diurnal pattern and value of price. Deregulated markets show a wide variation in the correlation between load and price. Some deregulated markets, most notably Britain and Spain, show patterns that are predictable and consistent, and hence that can encourage a customer to shape consumption behaviors. Other markets, for example South Australia, have patterns that are inconsistent and irregular, and hence are hard for a customer to interpret; a customer in such a market will have a higher incentive to escape risk through hedging mechanisms. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"Voronin S., Partanen J., Kauranne T.",A hybrid electricity price forecasting model for the Nordic electricity spot market,2014,17.0,"SUMMARY A hybrid electricity price forecasting model for the Finnish electricity spot market is proposed. The daily electricity price time series is analyzed in two layers - normal behavior and spiky behavior. Two different data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle trend and seasonality in the time series. An ARMA-based model is used to catch the linear relationship between the normal range price series and the explanatory variable, a GARCH model is used to unveil the heteroscedastic character of residuals and a neural network is applied to present the nonlinear impact of the explanatory variable on electricity prices and improve predictions based on time series techniques. The probability of a price spike occurrence and the value of a price spike are produced by a Gaussian Mixture model and K-nearest neighboring model, respectively. Forecasts of normal range prices and price spikes are generated to form an overall price forecast up to one week ahead. The results show that hybridization of the normal range price and price spikes forecasts may provide comprehensive and valuable information for electricity market participants. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",ARMA; electricity price forecast; GARCH; Gaussian mixture; K-nearest neighboring; model; neural network; price spikes,Commerce; Electric load forecasting; Forecasting; Models; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Time series; ARMA; Electricity prices; GARCH; Gaussian mixtures; Price spike; Costs,Article

This analysis provides a statistical model of regulating prices and volumes for the whole market for the considered period. The combination of the long term model with expected regulating states and volumes is used in order to generate short term scenarios of the regulating market.

The data analysis procedure includes both correlation and predictability analysis of the most important load and price indices.

For predictability analysis, the bifurcation diagrams and recurrence plots of the data have been investigated. The results of these analyses indicate existence of deterministic chaos in addition to non-stationarity property of the system which implies short-term predictability. In the next step, two artificial neural networks have been developed for forecasting the two price indices in Iran's electricity market. The models' input sets are selected regarding four aspects: the correlation properties of the available data, the critiques of Iran's electricity market, a proper convergence rate in case of sudden variations in the market price behavior, and the omission of cumulative forecasting errors.

"Mandal P., Senjyu T., Funabashi T.",Neural network models to predict short-term electricity prices and loads,2005,17.0,"Forecasting hourly electricity prices and loads in daily power markets is the most essential task and basis for any decision making. An approach to predict the market behaviors is to use the historical prices, loads and other required information to forecast the future prices and loads. This paper presents an approach for short-term electricity price and load forecasting using neural network model, which uses publicly available data from NEMMCO web site to forecast electricity price and load for the Victorian electricity market. An approach of selection of similar days is proposed according to which the load and price curves are forecasted by using the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. A Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of similar days. Two different ANN models, one for load forecasting and another for price forecasting have been proposed. The forecasted price and load from the neural networks are the corrected output of selected similar price and load days, respectively. MAPE results show that short-term electricity prices and loads in the deregulated Victorian market can be forecasted with reasonable accuracy. © 2005 IEEE.",Neural networks; Power market; Short-term price and load forecasting; Similar days,Costs; Decision making; Electric load forecasting; Electric loads; Electricity; Neural networks; Electricity prices; Power market; Short-term price and load forecasting; Mathematical models,Conference Paper

Breipohl A.M.,Electricity price forecasting models,2002,17.0,"This paper proposes that the price of electricity should be parsed into two components: energy price and ""reliability price"". From the supply point of view, in addition to the energy price, there is a cost associated with reliability, or continuity of supply. This cost, which differs from other commodities, arises because electricity cannot be stored. From the demand point of view for some customers electricity is an essential commodity, while other customers may want a choice of how much reliability they are willing to pay for. If customers have the options of interruptible rates or curtailable rates, or perhaps the option of limiting demand upon receipt of a signal from the control center, then they can consume energy but not reliability, or they can only partially consume reliability. Furthermore suppliers can reduce supply costs if they can reduce demand. In the long term reduced demand reduces the need for generation capacity. Over the short term, demand reduction that is under the control of the dispatch center can reduce the demand for ancillary services.",,Customer satisfaction; Electric power systems; Electricity; Reliability; Energy prices; Electric industry,Conference Paper
"Agrawal R.K., Muchahary F., Tripathi M.M.",Ensemble of relevance vector machines and boosted trees for electricity price forecasting,2019,16.0,"Real-time prediction of electricity pricing signals is essential for scheduling load demand in price-directed grids. In a deregulated electricity market, this helps substantially increase the gains of utility companies and minimize the electricity cost to the consumers. This paper introduces a novel model for electricity locational marginal price forecasting primarily centered on relevance vector machine. Two different versions of relevance vector machine are used based on Gaussian radial basis function and polynomial kernels in the first stage. The performance of the model is boosted using Extreme Gradient Boosting to incorporate the stochastic changes in prices. In the second stage, the outputs of the three models are stacked using Elastic net regression and the final price is forecasted after bagging the computed values. The model is trained and tested on real-time data of New England electricity market. Specifically, data for two years from 2012 to 2013 have been collected with a resolution of one hour. The proposed model has proven to be highly accurate and computationally cheap at the same time. It has been compared with various models that have been previously proposed for electricity forecasting including relevance vector machine, multilayer perceptron, random forest regressor, support vector machine, recurrent neural network, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The proposed model is found to outperform all the other mentioned models with a mean absolute error of 2.6 on the test set and is sufficiently cheap computationally with a training time of 88 s. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price forecasting; Ensemble model; Extreme gradient boosting; Relevance vector machines; Stacking,Costs; Decision trees; Deregulation; Electric industry; Forecasting; Multilayer neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Vectors; Electricity price forecasting; Ensemble modeling; Gradient boosting; Relevance Vector Machine; Stacking; Power markets; demand analysis; electricity; energy market; ensemble forecasting; extreme event; forecasting method; machinery; numerical model; regression analysis; New England; United States,Article
"Naz A., Javed M.U., Javaid N., Saba T., Alhussein M., Aurangzeb K.",Short-term electric load and price forecasting using enhanced extreme learning machine optimization in smart grids,2019,16.0,"A Smart Grid (SG) is a modernized grid to provide efficient, reliable and economic energy to the consumers. Energy is the most important resource in the world. An efficient energy distribution is required as smart devices are increasing dramatically. The forecasting of electricity consumption is supposed to be a major constituent to enhance the performance of SG. Various learning algorithms have been proposed to solve the forecasting problem. The sole purpose of this work is to predict the price and load efficiently. The first technique is Enhanced Logistic Regression (ELR) and the second technique is Enhanced Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (ERELM). ELR is an enhanced form of Logistic Regression (LR), whereas, ERELM optimizes weights and biases using a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Relief-F and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) are used for feature selection and extraction. On the basis of selected features, classification is performed using ELR. Cross validation is done for ERELM using Monte Carlo and K-Fold methods. The simulations are performed on two different datasets. The first dataset, i.e., UMass Electric Dataset is multi-variate while the second dataset, i.e., UCI Dataset is uni-variate. The first proposed model performed better with UMass Electric Dataset than UCI Dataset and the accuracy of second model is better with UCI than UMass. The prediction accuracy is analyzed on the basis of four different performance metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed techniques are then compared with four benchmark schemes. The comparison is done to verify the adaptivity of the proposed techniques. The simulation results show that the proposed techniques outperformed benchmark schemes. The proposed techniques efficiently increased the prediction accuracy of load and price. However, the computational time is increased in both scenarios. ELR achieved almost 5% better results than Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and almost 3% than LR. While, ERELM achieved almost 6% better results than ELM and almost 5% than RELM. However, the computational time is almost 20% increased with ELR and 50% with ERELM. Scalability is also addressed for the proposed techniques using half-yearly and yearly datasets. Simulation results show that ELR gives 5% better results while, ERELM gives 6% better results when used for yearly dataset. © 2019 by the authors.",CNN; ELR; ERELM; Forecasting; Load; LR; Price; RELM; Smart grid,Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Errors; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Lawrencium; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Loading; Mean square error; Monte Carlo methods; Neural networks; Power markets; Regression analysis; Classification and regression tree; ERELM; Feature selection and extractions; Mean absolute percentage error; Price; Recursive feature elimination; RELM; Smart grid; Smart power grids,Article
"Rafiei M., Niknam T., Khooban M.H.",Probabilistic electricity price forecasting by improved clonal selection algorithm and wavelet preprocessing,2017,16.0,"Probabilistic forecasting is an appropriate tool that helps electricity markets participants to improve their decision making. Due to changes in electricity prices, the point forecasting accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Hence, participants are more interested in results of probabilistic forecasting methods such as prediction intervals method. In this paper, a hybrid approach for probabilistic electricity price forecasting is presented. This model is based on using improved clonal selection algorithm and extreme learning machine for neural networks training process and wavelet preprocess. The wavelet is utilized to decompose data into well behaved subsets, which increases accuracy of the model. Also, due to the high required computational time for training the neural networks, autocorrelation function is used to reduce the number of neural networks inputs.

"Sánchez De La Nieta A.A., González V., Contreras J.",Portfolio decision of short-term electricity forecasted prices through stochastic programming,2016,16.0,"Deregulated electricity markets encourage firms to compete, making the development of renewable energy easier. An ordinary parameter of electricity markets is the electricity market price, mainly the day-ahead electricity market price. This paper describes a new approach to forecast day-ahead electricity market prices, whose methodology is divided into two parts as: (i) forecasting of the electricity price through autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models; and (ii) construction of a portfolio of ARIMA models per hour using stochastic programming. A stochastic programming model is used to forecast, allowing many input data, where filtering is needed. A case study to evaluate forecasts for the next 24 h and the portfolio generated by way of stochastic programming are presented for a specific day-ahead electricity market. The case study spans four weeks of each one of the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 using a specific pre-treatment of input data of the stochastic programming (SP) model. In addition, the results are discussed, and the conclusions are drawn. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.",ARIMA models; Day-ahead electricity market price; Forecasting portfolio; Stochastic programming,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Forecasting; Input output programs; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; ARIMA models; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Day-ahead electricity market; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity prices; Portfolio decisions; Renewable energies; Stochastic programming model; Power markets,Article
"Bello A., Reneses J., Muñoz A.",Medium-term probabilistic forecasting of extremely low prices in electricity markets: Application to the Spanish case,2016,16.0,"One of the most relevant challenges that have arisen in electricity markets during the last few years is the emergence of extremely low prices. Trying to predict these events is crucial for market agents in a competitive environment. This paper proposes a novel methodology to simultaneously accomplish punctual and probabilistic hourly predictions about the appearance of extremely low electricity prices in a medium-term scope. The proposed approach for making real ex ante forecasts consists of a nested compounding of different forecasting techniques, which incorporate Monte Carlo simulation, combined with spatial interpolation techniques. The procedure is based on the statistical identification of the process key drivers. Logistic regression for rare events, decision trees, multilayer perceptrons and a hybrid approach, which combines a market equilibrium model with logistic regression, are used. Moreover, this paper assesses whether periodic models in which parameters switch according to the day of the week can be even more accurate. The proposed techniques are compared to a Markov regime switching model and several naive methods. The proposed methodology empirically demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving promising results on a real case study based on the Spanish electricity market. This approach can provide valuable information for market agents when they face decision making and risk-management processes. Our findings support the additional benefit of using a hybrid approach for deriving more accurate predictions. © 2016 by the authors.",Electricity markets; Extremely low prices; Hybrid approach; Medium-term electricity price forecasting; Probabilistic forecasting; Spikes,Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Power markets; Regression analysis; Risk management; Electricity price forecasting; Extremely low prices; Hybrid approach; Probabilistic forecasting; Spikes; Decision making,Article
"Swinand G.P., O'Mahoney A.",Estimating the impact of wind generation and wind forecast errors on energy prices and costs in Ireland,2015,16.0,"This paper studies the impact of wind generation on system costs and prices in Ireland. The importance of wind power and potential impacts on system costs is of interest to power system planners and policy makers globally. However, the impact of wind generation on system costs has been only studied with limited actual data from power systems with increased wind penetration. The paper uses a unique dataset of half-hourly system demand, generation, forecast and actual wind generation, along with Irish system marginal price (SMP) data from 2008 to autumn 2012. An econometric time-series model of SMP as a function of forecast and realized demand and wind generation yields results which suggest that each 1% increase in wind generation reduces SMP in Ireland by about 0.06%, while each 1% wind forecast error increases SMP about 0.02%. In absolute terms, though, at the mean the impact of wind forecast errors is small, or about 0.4€cent/MWh-wind generated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Cost function; Econometrics; Power generation economics; Power system economics; Wind power generation,Wind power; Econometrics; Energy prices; Ireland; Power generation economics; Power system economics; Wind forecasts; Wind generation; Cost functions; cost analysis; econometrics; energy planning; error analysis; forecasting method; power generation; price determination; renewable resource; wind power; Ireland,Article
Ritz R.A.,Price discrimination and limits to arbitrage: An analysis of global LNG markets,2014,16.0,"Gas prices around the world vary widely despite being connected by international trade of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Some industry observers argue that major exporters have acted irrationally by not arbitraging prices. This is also difficult to reconcile with a competitive model in which regional price differences exist solely because of transport costs. We show that a model which incorporates market power can rationalize observed prices and trade flows. We highlight how different features of the LNG market limit the ability and/or incentive of other players to engage in arbitrage, including constraints in LNG shipping. We also present some rough estimates of market power in short-term sales by Qatar (to Japan and the UK), and discuss the potential impact of US LNG exports. © 2014.",International trade; Limits to arbitrage; Market power; Natural gas; Price discrimination,Costs; International trade; Natural gas; Natural gas; Competitive models; Limits to arbitrage; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Market Power; Potential impacts; Price difference; Price discrimination; Transport costs; LNG markets; Liquefied natural gas; International trade; competitiveness; gas production; gas supply; international trade; liquefied natural gas; price determination; price dynamics; trade flow; energy market; export; incentive; numerical model; Japan; Qatar; United Kingdom; United States,Article
Kristiansen T.,A time series spot price forecast model for the Nord Pool market,2014,16.0,We present three relatively simple spot price forecast models for the Nord Pool market based on historic spot and futures prices including data for inflow and reservoir levels. The models achieve a relatively accurate forecast of the weekly spot prices. The composite regression model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of around 7.5% and under-forecasts the actual spot price by some 1.4 NOK/MW h in the sample period. Out of sample testing achieves a MAPE of around 7.4% including a match of the actual spot price. A myopic model using the previous week's spot price as a predictor for the next week's spot price achieves a MAPE of 7.5% and under-forecasts the actual spot price by some 0.9 EUR/MW h. A futures model using the futures price for next week as a predictor for next week's spot price achieves a MAPE of 5.3% and over-forecast the actual spot price by some 4.3 EUR/MW h. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"O'Mahoney A., Denny E.",Electricity prices and generator behaviour in gross pool electricity markets,2013,16.0,"Electricity market liberalisation has become common practice internationally. The justification for this process has been to enhance competition in a market traditionally characterised by statutory monopolies in an attempt to reduce costs to end-users. This paper endeavours to see whether a pool market achieves this goal of increasing competition and reducing electricity prices. Here the electricity market is set up as a sealed bid second price auction. Theory predicts that such markets should result with firms bidding their marginal cost, thereby resulting in an efficient outcome and lower costs to consumers. The Irish electricity system with a gross pool market experiences among the highest electricity prices in Europe. Thus, we analyse the Irish pool system econometrically in order to test if the high electricity prices seen there are due to participants bidding outside of market rules or out of line with theory. Overall we do not find any evidence that the interaction between generator and the pool in the Irish electricity market is not efficient. Thus, the pool element of the market structure does not explain the high electricity prices experienced in Ireland. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Auction theory; Electricity markets; Multiple regression analysis,Auction theory; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Electricity system; Market structures; Multiple regression analysis; Pool electricity market; Second-price auction; Commerce; Electric industry; Electricity; Lakes; Regression analysis; Costs; competition (economics); electricity supply; energy market; monopoly; multiple regression; price dynamics; Ireland,Article
"Bi S., Zhang Y.J.",False-data injection attack to control real-time price in electricity market,2013,16.0,"The normal operation of electricity market requires accurate state estimation of the power grids. However, recent research shows that carefully synthesized false-data injection attacks can easily introduce errors to state estimates without being detected by the current security systems. In this paper, we analyze and formulate an effective false-data injection attack to control real-time electricity price at any tagged bus. It is observed that an adversary capable of false-data injection attack can induce false real-time electricity price by fabricating biased transmission congestion pattern. From the strategic level, we propose a simple algorithm that finds the effective congestion pattern with minor distortion to the normal system operation. For practical implementation, load redistribution attack, a special false-data injection attack which produces biased load estimates, is used to achieve the derived congestion pattern. We also propose a cost-aware neighborhood load redistribution attack, which only compromises limited measurements around the tagged bus. From theory to practice, our results here reveal the potential cyber vulnerabilities of current electricity market and would help to build more secure smart power grid in the future. © 2013 IEEE.",,Communication; Costs; Electric industry; Smart power grids; State estimation; Cyber vulnerabilities; Electricity market; Electricity prices; False-data injection attacks; Load redistribution; Normal operations; Recent researches; Transmission congestion; Security of data,Conference Paper

"Warrington J., Mariéthoz S., Jones C.N., Morari M.",Predictive power dispatch through negotiated locational pricing,2010,16.0,"A predictive mechanism is proposed in order to reduce price volatility linked to large fluctuations from demand and renewable energy generation in competitive electricity markets. The market participants are modelled as price-elastic units, price-inelastic units, and storage operators. The distributed control algorithm determines prices over a time horizon through a negotiation procedure in order to maximize social welfare while satisfying network constraints. A simple flow allocation method is used to assign responsibility for constraint violations on the network to individual units and a control rule is then used to adjust nodal prices accordingly. Such a framework is appropriate for the inclusion of aggregated household appliances or other 'virtual' market participants realized through smart grid infrastructure. Results are examined in detail for a 4-bus network and then success is demonstrated for a densely-populated 39-bus network. Formal convergence requirements are given under a restricted subset of the demonstrated conditions.

We introduce a new methodology to predict long-term electricity market prices consisting of two parts: (1) a self-developed form of Porter’s five forces analysis (PFFA) determining that electricity markets are characterized by a fairly steady price increase. Dominant driving factors come out to be: (i) uncertainty of future electricity prices; (ii) regulatory complexity; and (iii) generation overcapacities. Similar conclusions derive from (2) a self-developed form of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). In this case, we find that the electricity market particularly depends on (i) market liberalization and (ii) the European Union (EU)’s economy growth. The applied methodologies provide a novel contribution in forecasting electricity price trends, by analyzing the sentiments, expectations, and knowledge of industry experts, through an assessment of factors influencing the market price and goals of key market participants.

Saâdaoui F.,A seasonal feedforward neural network to forecast electricity prices,2017,15.0,"In power industry and management, given the peculiarity and high complexity of the time series, it is highly requested to make models more flexible and well adapted to the data, in order to give them the ability to capture and recognize the most complex patterns, and consequently gain more accuracy in forecasting. To fulfill this aim, we define the seasonal autoregressive neural network (SAR-NN) as a dynamic feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), essentially conceived to forecast electricity prices. The SAR-NN is an ANN-based autoregressive model that considers that autoregressors are only those that are lagged by a multiple of the period p of the dominating seasonality. Moving forward this neural network, step-by-step, allows to generate multiple-steps-ahead reliable forecasts. This model is specifically designed to robustly overcome the strong seasonal effects and the other nonlinear patterns that often harm ANNs forecasting performance. The strategy is tested and compared to a number of homologous models throughout empirical experiments.

"Ortiz M., Ukar O., Azevedo F., Múgica A.",Price forecasting and validation in the Spanish electricity market using forecasts as input data,2016,15.0,"The electricity sector has been subjected to major changes in the last few years. Previously, there existed a regulated system where electric companies could know beforehand the amount of energy each generator would produce, hence basing their largely operational strategy on cost minimization in order to increase their profits. In Spain, from 1988 till 1997, electricity prices were established by the 'Marco Legal Estable' - Stable Legal Framework -, where the Ministry of Industry and Energy acknowledged the existence of certain generation costs related to each type of technology. It was an industrial sector with no actual competition and therefore, with very few controllable risks. In the aftermath of the electricity market liberalization competition and uncertainty arose. Electricity spot prices became highly volatile due to the specific characteristics of electricity as a commodity. Long-term contracts allowed for hedge funds to act against price fluctuation in the electricity market. As a consequence, developing an accurate electricity price forecasting model is an extremely difficult task for electricity market agents. This work aims to propose a methodology to improve the limitations of those methodologies just using historical data to forecast electricity prices. In this manner, and in order to gain access to more recent data, instead of using natural gas prices and electricity load historical data, a regression model to forecast the evolution of natural gas prices, and a model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to forecast electricity loads, are proposed. The results of these models are used as input for an electricity price forecast model. Finally, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, several study cases applied to the Spanish market, using real price data, are presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial neural network; Electricity markets; Price forecast; Regression model; Volatility,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Electric industry; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Natural gas; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Long-term contracts; Operational strategies; Price forecasts; Regression model; Spanish electricity markets; Volatility; Power markets,Article

Tashpulatov S.N.,Estimating the volatility of electricity prices: The case of the England and Wales wholesale electricity market,2013,15.0,"Price fluctuations that partially comove with demand are a specific feature inherent to liberalized electricity markets. The regulatory authority in Great Britain, however, believed that sometimes electricity prices were significantly higher than what was expected and, therefore, introduced price-cap regulation and divestment series. In this study, I analyze how the introduced institutional changes and regulatory reforms affected the dynamics of daily electricity prices in the England and Wales wholesale electricity market during 1990-2001.This research finds that the introduction of price-cap regulation did achieve the goal of lowering the price level at the cost of higher price volatility. Later, the first series of divestments is found to be successful at lowering price volatility, which however happens at the cost of a higher price level. Finally, this study also documents that the second series of divestments was more successful at lowering both the price level and volatility. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Conditional volatility; Electricity prices; Regulation,Conditional volatility; Electricity prices; Institutional change; Liberalized electricity market; Price cap regulation; Regulation; Regulatory authorities; Wholesale electricity markets; Electric industry; Electricity; Costs; electricity supply; institutional framework; liberalization; price dynamics; reform process; regulatory framework; England; United Kingdom; Wales,Article

This article tries to solve the problems of traditional nodal pricing methods to be able to consider opportunity and availability costs for the generators. A modified model of generators reactive power production cost has been used in OPF objective function considering normal and contingency conditions. Availability cost would be estimated considering the volume of network demand from the generators in contingency states through probability calculations. This cost would be paid to all the units that possibly will needed to produce reactive power in contingency states. Purvey of required availability of generation units to deal with emergency conditions, encouraging providers to invest in critical areas in the network and fair distribution of reactive power production costs over several producers are some advantages of the proposed method.

"Yan X., Chowdhury N.A.",Electricity market clearing price forecasting in a deregulated electricity market,2010,15.0,"This paper presents a mid-term electricity market clearing price forecasting technique utilizing neural network approach. Forecasting of mid-term market clearing price is essential for decision making, scheduling and bidding strategy planning purposes. However, forecasting mid-term electricity market clearing price is a very complex non-linear problem. Neural network based approaches can be effective forecasting tools in an environment with high degree of non-linearity and uncertainty. Two new artificial neural networks have been proposed and reported in this paper that can be utilized to forecast mid-term daily peak and mid-term hourly electricity market clearing price. Two situations have been considered; market clearing price forecasting under real deregulated electric market and under deregulated electric market with perfect competition.

"Vahidinasab V., Jadid S.",Bayesian neural network model to predict day-ahead electricity prices,2010,15.0,"Market participants in the new competitive electricity markets find price forecasting so valuable in developing their bidding strategies. In this paper, the Bayesian neural network (BNN) approach is proposed for day-ahead prediction of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the pool based energy markets, in which to select the optimum inputs of the BNN, the correlation coefficient technique is used. LMP has a volatile and time dependent behavior. Hence, prediction of such a complex signal is a challenging task requiring a qualified forecasting tool, which not only fits well to the training data, but also can predict the stochastic behavior of unseen part of the signal. The proposed Bayesian approach to predict day-ahead electricity prices presents noteworthy advantages over the classical neural networks (NN) methods which include the avoidance of network overfitting, an indication of the degree of uncertainty in the predictions, automatic selection of an appropriate scale for network weights and, accordingly, selection of the optimal forecasting model. Examining the proposed forecast strategy on the different periods of the Pennsylvania- New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can provide more accurate results than the other price forecasting techniques, such as, ARIMA time series, wavelet-ARIMA, classical NN, and also a similar day method.

"Mujeeb S., Javaid N.",ESAENARX and DE-RELM: Novel schemes for big data predictive analytics of electricity load and price,2019,14.0,"Accurate forecasting of the electricity price and load is an essential and challenging task in smart grids. Since electricity load and price have a strong correlation, the forecast accuracy degrades when bidirectional relation of price and load is not considered. Therefore, this paper considers price and load relationship and proposes two Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs (MIMO) Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNNs) models for price and load forecasting. The first proposed model, Efficient Sparse Autoencoder Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with eXogenous inputs (ESAENARX) comprises of feature engineering and forecasting. For feature engineering, we propose ESAE and performed forecasting using existing method NARX. The second proposed model: Differential Evolution Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (DE-RELM) is based on RELM model and the meta-heuristic DE optimization technique. The descriptive and predictive analyses are performed on two well-known electricity markets’ big data, i.e., ISO NE and PJM. The proposed models outperform their sub models and a benchmark model. The refined and informative features extracted by ESAE improve the forecasting accuracy in ESANARX and optimization improves the DE-RELM's accuracy. As compared to cascade Elman network, ESAENARX has reduced MAPE upto 16% for load forecasting, 7% for price forecasting.

"Csereklyei Z., Qu S., Ancev T.",The effect of wind and solar power generation on wholesale electricity prices in Australia,2019,14.0,"Our paper investigates the effect of wind and utility-scale solar electricity generation on wholesale electricity prices in Australia over 2010–2018. We use both high frequency (30-min) and daily datasets for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). We estimate autoregressive distributed lag models (ARDL) to decompose the merit order effect of wind and utility-scale solar PV generation over time and across states. We find that an extra GW of dispatched wind capacity decreases the wholesale electricity price by 11 AUD/MWh at the time of generation, while solar capacity by 14 AUD/MWh. The daily merit order effect is lower. We show that the wind merit order effect has been increasing as a function of dispatched wind capacity over time. Despite of this, wholesale electricity prices in Australia have been increasing, predominantly driven by the increase in natural gas prices. Our findings further strengthen the evidence of the merit order effect of renewable energy sources, with important implications for the current energy policy debate in Australia. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price; Merit order effect; Natural gas price; Solar generation; Wind generation,Costs; Natural gas; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Electricity prices; Natural gas price; Ordering effects; Solar generation; Wind generation; Electric power generation; alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy policy; natural gas; price dynamics; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Australia,Article

It gives an economic opportunity to renewable energy-based distributed generation, such as photovoltaic, small hydro or wind, as it can build a bridge to the integration of renewable resources in the wholesale electricity market. In this market, changes in the offers of portfolio electricity technologies affect wholesale electricity prices, since marginal generation costs are transmitted through to the wholesale market. This paper investigates the impact of energy-based distributed generation technologies composition on wholesale electricity prices variations of different EU energy markets by using a Maximum Entropy Econometric estimation procedure.

This paper presents a new intelligent hybrid three-stage model for simultaneous load and price forecasting. The proposed algorithm uses wavelet and Kalman machines for the first stage load and price forecasting. Each of the load and price data is decomposed into different frequency components, and Kalman machine is used to forecast each frequency components of load and price data. Then a Kohonen Self Organizing Map (SOM) finds similar days of load frequency components and feeds them into the second stage forecasting machine. In addition, mutual information based feature selection is used to find the relevant price data and rank them based on their relevance. The second stage uses Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for forecasting of load and price frequency components, respectively. The third stage machine uses the second stage outputs and feeds them into its MLP-ANN and ANFIS machines to improve the load and price forecasting accuracy. The proposed three-stage algorithm is applied to Nordpool and mainland Spain power markets. The obtained results are compared with the recent load and price forecast algorithms, and showed that the three-stage algorithm presents a better performance for day-ahead electricity market load and price forecasting. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Feature selection; Mutual information; Neural network; Price and load forecasting; Wavelet transformation,Commerce; Conformal mapping; Electric load forecasting; Electric utilities; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Machine components; Neural networks; Self organizing maps; Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS); Day-ahead electricity market; Kohonen self-organizing maps; Multi layer perceptron; Mutual informations; Price and load forecasting; Price forecast algorithms; Wavelet transformations; Power markets,Article
"Monteiro C., Ramirez-Rosado I.J., Fernandez-Jimenez L.A., Ribeiro M.",New probabilistic price forecasting models: Application to the Iberian electricity market,2018,14.0,"This article presents original Probabilistic Price Forecasting Models, for day-ahead hourly price forecasts in electricity markets, based on a Nadaraya–Watson Kernel Density Estimator approach. A Gaussian Kernel Density Estimator function is used for each input variable, which allows to calculate the parameters of the probability density function (PDF) of a Beta distribution for the hourly price variable. Thus, valuable information is obtained from PDFs such as point forecasts, variance values, quantiles, probabilities of prices, and time series representations of forecast uncertainty. A Reliability Indicator is also introduced to give a measure of “reliability” of forecasts. The Probabilistic Price Forecasting Models were satisfactorily applied to the real-world case study of the Iberian Electricity Market. Input variables of these models include recent prices, power demands and power generations in the previous day, power demands in the previous week, forecasts of demand, wind power generation and weather for the day-ahead, and chronological data. The best model, corresponding to the best combination of input variables that achieves the lowest MAE, obtains one of the highest Reliability Indicator values. A systematic analysis of MAE values of the Probabilistic Price Forecasting Models for different combinations of input variables showed that as more types of input variables were considered in these models, MAE values improved and Reliability Indicator values usually increased. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity prices; Iberian electricity market; Market prices; Probabilistic forecast; Short-term forecasting,Commerce; Cost estimating; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Reliability analysis; Wind power; Electricity prices; Iberian electricity market; Market price; Probabilistic forecasts; Short-term forecasting; Power markets,Article

"Chellam S., Kalyani S.",Power flow tracing based transmission congestion pricing in deregulated power markets,2016,14.0,"The objective of this paper is to propose a simple transmission congestion pricing scheme based on tracing principle by considering generator fixed cost, cost for incurring loss and transmission congestion cost. Restructuring has brought about considerable changes by the virtue of which electricity is now a commodity and has converted into deregulated type. Such a competitive market has paved way for innumerable participants. This concept of restructuring has led to overloading of transmission lines. In this paper, power flow tracing has been employed by using suitable optimization algorithm, where the real power generation has been maximized. Congestion in the transmission line has been produced in a new fashion by maximizing the real power demand. The power flow under normal operating condition and congestion is determined and hence the difference in power flow is estimated. Based on the estimated power flow difference, the transmission line congestion cost is computed. Pool model and bilateral model has been considered in simulation study to introduce the concept of deregulation. The proposed method is tested and validated on Modified IEEE 30 bus test system and Indian utility 69 bus test system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Xiao C., Dong Z., Xu Y., Meng K., Zhou X., Zhang X.",Rational and self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine for electricity price forecast,2016,14.0,"Electricity price forecast is of great importance to electricity market participants. Moreover, various prediction approaches based on extreme learning machine (ELM) have been identified as effective on normal decision space. Especially, evolutionary extreme learning machine (E-ELM) may obtain better solution quality. However, in high dimensional space, E-ELM is time-consuming because it is difficult to converge into optimal region when just relied on stochastic searching approaches. In addition, due to the complex functional relationship is often complicated, the objective function of E-ELM seems hard to be mined directly for obtaining useful mathematical information to guide the optimum exploring. This paper proposes a new differential evolution (DE)-like algorithm to enhance E-ELM for more accurate and reliable prediction of electricity price. The approximation model for producing DE-like trail vector is the key mechanism, which may use simpler mathematical mapping to replace the original yet complicated functional relationship within a small region. Thus, the evolutionary procedure frequently guided by rational searching directions may make the E-ELM more robust and faster than supported only by those stochastic methods. Several benchmarks are applied to test the performances of the proposed algorithm and the experimental results have shown that the new method can improve the performance of E-ELM. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Approximation model; Differential evolution; Electricity price prediction; Extreme learning machine,Benchmarking; Costs; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Functions; Knowledge acquisition; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Approximation model; Differential Evolution; Electricity prices; Extreme learning machine; Functional relationship; High dimensional spaces; Mathematical information; Stochastic searching; Learning systems,Article

Hence, enhancement of forecasting approaches is required for all electricity market players to deal with the non-stationary and stochastic nature of such time series, making it possible to accurately support their decisions in a competitive environment with lower forecasting error and with an acceptable computational time. As previously published methodologies have shown, hybrid approaches are good candidates to overcome most of the previous concerns about time-series forecasting. In this sense, this paper proposes an enhanced hybrid approach composed of an innovative combination of wavelet transform (WT), differential evolutionary particle swarm optimization (DEEPSO), and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to forecast EMP signals in different electricity markets and wind power in Portugal, in the short-term, considering only historical data.

"Clements A.E., Herrera R., Hurn A.S.",Modelling interregional links in electricity price spikes,2015,14.0,"Abnormally high price spikes in spot electricity markets represent a significant risk to market participants. As such, a literature has developed that focuses on forecasting the probability of such spike events, moving beyond simply forecasting the level of price. Many univariate time series models have been proposed to deal with spikes within an individual market region. This paper is the first to develop a multivariate self-exciting point process model for dealing with price spikes across connected regions in the Australian National Electricity Market. The importance of the physical infrastructure connecting the regions on the transmission of spikes is examined. It is found that spikes are transmitted between the regions, and the size of spikes is influenced by the available transmission capacity.

"He Y., Wang B., Wang J., Xiong W., Xia T.",Correlation between Chinese and international energy prices based on a HP filter and time difference analysis,2013,14.0,"To establish a reasonable system and mechanism for Chinese energy prices, we use the Granger causality test, Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter and time difference analysis to research the pricing relationship between Chinese and international energy prices. We find that Chinese and international crude oil prices changed synchronously while Chinese refined oil prices follow the changes of international oil prices with the time difference being about 1 month to 2 months. Further, Australian coal prices Granger causes Chinese coal prices, and there is a high correlation between them. The U.S. electricity price is influenced by the WTI crude oil price, the U.S. gasoline price and the HenryHub gas price. Due to the unreasonable price-setting mechanism and regulation from the central government, China's terminal market prices for both electricity and natural gas do not reflect the real supply-demand situation. This paper provides quantitative results on the correlation between Chinese and international energy prices to better predict the impact of international energy price fluctuations on China's domestic energy supply and guide the design of more efficient energy pricing policies.

"Eichler M., Türk D.",Fitting semiparametric Markov regime-switching models to electricity spot prices,2013,14.0,"Recently regime-switching models have become the standard tool for modeling electricity prices. These models capture the main properties of electricity spot prices well but estimation of the model parameters requires computer intensive methods. Moreover, the distribution of the price spikes must be fully specified although the high volatility of the spikes makes it difficult to check such distributional assumptions. Consequently, there are a number of competing proposals for the distribution in the spike regime. As an alternative, we propose a semiparametric Markov regime-switching model that leaves the distribution under the spike regime unspecified. We show that the model parameters can be estimated by employing robust statistical techniques. This presents an alternative to the existing estimation methods that are based on computer intensive numerical maximization of the likelihood function. The model in combination with the estimation framework is easier to estimate, needs less computation time and distributional assumptions. To show its advantages we compare the proposed model with a well-established Markov regime-switching model in a simulation study. Furthermore, we apply the model to log-prices for the Australian electricity market. The results are in accordance with the results from the simulation study, indicating that the proposed model might be advantageous whenever the distribution of the spike process is not sufficiently known. The results are thus encouraging and suggest the use of our approach when modeling electricity prices and pricing derivatives. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity spot prices; Markov regime-switching; Mean-reversion; Robust estimation; Semiparametric estimation; Simulation study,Electricity spot price; Markov regime-switching; Mean-reversion; Robust estimation; Semi parametric estimation; Simulation studies; Computer simulation; Costs; Electric properties; Electricity; Estimation; Numerical methods; Parameter estimation; computer simulation; electricity generation; energy market; estimation method; Markov chain; numerical model; price dynamics; Australia,Article

"Mandal P., Srivastava A.K., Senjyu T., Negnevitsky M.",A new recursive neural network algorithm to forecast electricity price for PJM day-ahead market,2010,14.0,"This paper evaluates the usefulness of publicly available electricity market information in predicting the hourly prices in the PJM day-ahead electricity market using recursive neural network (RNN) technique, which is based on similar days (SD) approach. RNN is a multi-step approach based on one output node, which uses the previous prediction as input for the subsequent forecasts. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed RNN model is done with respect to SD method and other literatures. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed RNN approach in forecasting short-term electricity prices, different criteria are used. Mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of reasonably small values were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. Error variance, one of the important performance criteria, is also calculated in order to measure robustness of the proposed RNN model. The numerical results obtained through the simulation to forecast next 24 and 72 h electricity prices show that the forecasts generated by the proposed RNN model are significantly accurate and efficient, which confirm that the proposed algorithm performs well for shortterm price forecasting.

"Janssen M., Wobben M.",Electricity pricing and market power-evidence from Germany,2009,14.0,"The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology for measuring the exercise of potential market power in liberalized electricity markets. We therefore investigate producer behavior in the context of electricity pricing with respect to fundamental time-dependent marginal cost (TMC), i.e., CO 2- and fuel cost. In doing so, we do not-in contrast to most current approaches to market power investigation-rely on an estimate of the entire generation cost, which inevitably suffers from the lack of appropriate available data. Applying an analytical model of a day-ahead electricity market, we derive work-on rates, which provide information about the impact of TMC variations on electricity prices in the market constellations of perfect competition, quasi-monopoly, and monopoly. Comparing these model-based work-on rates with actual work-on rates, estimated by an adjusted first-differences regression model of German power prices on the cost for hard coal, natural gas, and emission allowances, we find evidence of the exercise of market power in the period 2006-2008. However, our results reveal that German market competitiveness increases marginally. We confirm our results by simulating a TMC-driven diffusion model of futures power prices estimated by maximum-likelihood.

"Mandal P., Senjyu T., Urasaki N., Funabashi T., Srivastava A.K.",Short-term price forecasting for competitive electricity market,2006,14.0,"Short-term price forecasting in competitive electricity markets is critical for consumers and producers in planning their operations and managing their price risk. This paper adopts artificial neural network (ANN) model based on similar days methodology in order to forecast weekly electricity prices in the PJM market. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, extensive analysis is conducted using data from the PJM Interconnection. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, and historical price factors are discussed. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed ANN model with that of forecasts obtained from similar days approach is discussed. The forecasting error is the major concern for forecaster; a lower error indicates a better result. Accumulative error depends on forecasting period (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). It will increase for a longer time forecasts. In this paper, the test results obtained by using the proposed ANN provide reliable forecast for weekly price forecasting as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values obtained for the first and last week of February 2006 are 7.66% and 8.88%, respectively. Similarly, MAPE for the second week of January 2006 is obtained as 12.92%. Forecast mean square error (FMSE) and MAPE results obtained through the simulation show that the proposed ANN model is capable of forecasting locational marginal price (LMP) in the PJM market efficiently. © 2006 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Competitive power market; Price forecasting; Similar days,Backpropagation; Costs; Forecasting; Marketing; Neural networks; Statistical tests; Accumulative errors; Ann models; Artificial neural network; Competitive electricity markets; Competitive power market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting errors; Forecasting performances; Load factors; Locational Marginal prices; Mean absolute percentage errors; Mean squares; Model-based; PJM interconnections; Price factors; Price forecasting; Price risks; Similar days; Similar days approaches; Test results; Time factors; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper
"Ferrero R.W., Shahidehpour S.M.",Short-term power purchases considering uncertain prices,1997,14.0,"In deregulated systems, utilities have partial knowledge of the price and amount of power available in the market. Other variables such as forecasted load in utility and fuel availability may also be uncertain. In the paper, an optimisation procedure that models uncertainties using fuzzy numbers is presented. The proposed method defines the range of control variables (local generations and imports) for satsifying operational constraints with a total operation cost lower than a predefined goal. Price of imported power, local generation as well as line flows and loads are defined as linguistic variables and represented with fuzzy numbers. The fuzzy optimisation is transformed into a classical (crisp) optimisation problem by considering a degree of acceptance for each constraint. The problem is formulated with a linear objective function and nonlinear constraints. An iterative procedure is used to compute the minimum operation cost. An example system is used to show applications of the proposed method in the decision-making process inherent in uncertain environments. © IEE, 1997.",Electric power systems; Fuzzy mathematics; Nonlinear optimisation,Constraint theory; Costs; Decision making; Electric generators; Electric utilities; Fuzzy sets; Iterative methods; Optimization; Short term power purchases; Electric power systems,Article
"Chai S., Xu Z., Jia Y.",Conditional Density Forecast of Electricity Price Based on Ensemble ELM and Logistic EMOS,2019,13.0,"In recent years, probabilistic forecast of electricity price has become of particular interests to market participants as it can effectively model the uncertainties due to competitive market behaviors. Decision makers heavily rely on such forecast to formulate optimal strategies with minimal risk and maximum profits to deal with stochasticity in market and system operation. Different from the widely used volatility models with least square or maximum likelihood techniques in probabilistic forecast of prices, this paper proposes a reliable continuous ranked probability score-oriented predictive density construction strategy for day-ahead electricity prices. The proposed method effectively quantifies the uncertainty involved in extreme learning machine network by applying an ensemble structure and a logistic distribution-based ensemble model output statistics technique. Moreover, an efficient covariance structure directly determined by the empirical correlations of observed probabilistic forecast series is developed to capture the essential temporal interdependence thus to facilitate the operational scenarios' generation. Through validating on the real day-ahead market in Sweden, the proposed hybrid approach proves to provide superior full distributional forecasting skill over the existing approaches. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Density forecasts; ensemble forecasts; marginal clearing price; scenarios generation; uncertainty quantification,Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Density forecast; Ensemble forecasts; Marginal clearing price; Scenarios generation; Uncertainty quantifications; Forecasting,Article
"Zarnikau J., Woo C.K., Zhu S., Tsai C.H.",Market price behavior of wholesale electricity products: Texas,2019,13.0,"Applying a regression-based approach to a newly developed sample of over 60,000 hourly observations for 01/01/2011–12/30/2017, we answer the question: what moves the day-ahead market (DAM) prices for energy and ancillary services (AS) and the real-time market (RTM) price for energy in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)? Our answer comprises the following findings that capture the interdependence of ERCOT's energy and AS products: (1) the DAM energy price increases with the day-ahead forecasts of natural gas price, system load and AS requirements but declines with nuclear and wind generation's forecasts; (2) the AS prices increase with the DAM energy price and the AS procurement forecasts but decline with the AS offer forecasts; and (3) the RTM energy price increases with the DAM energy price but diverges from the DAM energy price due to forecasting errors related to the DAM energy price's fundamental drivers. These findings imply that Texas can reduce the prices for day-ahead energy, day-ahead AS and real-time energy via wind generation development and demand-side-management. Further, Texas can improve its electricity trading efficiency by improving ERCOT's forecast accuracy to narrow the RTM energy price's divergence from the DAM energy price. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Ancillary services; D44; D47; Day-ahead market; Electricity products; ERCOT; G13; G14; Q41; Real-time market,Commerce; Costs; Dams; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Natural gas; Ancillary service; Day ahead market; Electric reliability council of texas; Electricity trading; ERCOT; Forecast accuracy; Real-time market; Wholesale electricity; Power markets; electricity generation; electricity supply; forecasting method; market conditions; price determination; real time; Texas; United States,Article
"Karabiber O.A., Xydis G.","Electricity price forecasting in the Danish day-ahead market using the TBATS, ANN and ARIMA methods",2019,13.0,"In this paper day-ahead electricity price forecasting for the Denmark-West region is realized with a 24 h forecasting range. The forecasting is done for 212 days from the beginning of 2017 and past data from 2016 is used. For forecasting, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Trigonometric Seasonal Box-Cox Transformation with ARMA residuals Trend and Seasonal Components (TBATS) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods are used and seasonal naïve forecast is utilized as a benchmark. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are used as accuracy criterions. ARIMA and ANN are utilized with external variables and variable analysis is realized in order to improve forecasting results. As a result of variable analysis, it was observed that excluding temperature from external variables helped improve forecasting results. In terms of mean error ARIMA yielded the best results while ANN had the lowest minimum error and standard deviation. TBATS performed better than ANN in terms of mean error. To further improve forecasting accuracy, the three forecasts were combined using simple averaging and ANN methods and they were both found to be beneficial, with simple averaging having better accuracy. Overall, this paper demonstrates a solid forecasting methodology, while showing actual forecasting results and improvements for different forecasting methods. © 2019 by the authors.",ARIMA; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combination; Neural network,Commerce; Errors; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; ARIMA; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Box Cox transformation; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combinations; Forecasting accuracy; Root mean squared errors; Power markets,Article
"Gürtler M., Paulsen T.",The effect of wind and solar power forecasts on day-ahead and intraday electricity prices in Germany,2018,13.0,"This study analyzes the effects of wind and solar power generation forecasts on electricity prices. Converse to the existing empirical literature in this area, we apply a panel data analysis to control for endogeneity due to unobserved heterogeneity. We use a dataset with 24 daily observations of day-ahead and intraday prices from 2010 to 2016, and we apply a fixed effects regression under consideration of robust Driscoll-Kraay standard errors. A noteworthy element of the regression model is the simulation-based design of a variable indicating the power generation technology that is price-determining at a certain point in time. In this context, we differentiate between the fuel types coal, gas, and others, to model the nonlinear price behavior for a varying demand. For 2016, we find price dampening effects of both wind and solar power of approximately 0.6 €/MWh per additional GWh of feed-in. Along with the rapidly increasing shares of wind and solar power of the total power generation during the last years, their price dampening effect has declined since 2013, due to a drop in fuel prices. Another finding is that a reduction in forecasting errors on the power generation from wind and solar, and smoothing of the cyclical demand would lead to a decreased price volatility. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Forecasting errors; Merit-order effect; Ramping costs; Renewable energy sources; Solar; Wind,Errors; Forecasting; Power markets; Regression analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind; Forecasting error; Ordering effects; Ramping costs; Renewable energy source; Solar; Costs; alternative energy; cost analysis; electricity generation; forecasting method; price dynamics; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Germany,Article
"Moshiri S., Martinez Santillan M.A.",The welfare effects of energy price changes due to energy market reform in Mexico,2018,13.0,"Despite being a large energy producer and exporter, Mexico may soon become a net total energy importer due to a decline in oil reserves and increasing domestic consumption. To increase efficiency in the energy market, Mexican authorities approved a constitutional amendment aiming to open the state-run energy markets to competition in 2013. The reform is expected to raise efficiency and to lower energy prices in the long run. However, it will take some time for the new institutional arrangements to settle and the reform objectives to materialize. The removal of subsidies, which is expected to take place after the reform, will also raise prices particularly in the short run. In this paper, we analyze the effect of likely energy price changes due to energy market reform on household consumption and welfare in different income groups. We estimate the QUAIDS model using the nonlinear SURE method and the Mexican household budget surveys for the period 2002–2012 to obtain elasticities. The results show great heterogeneity in elasticities across energy types and income groups. Specifically, energy demand is elastic with respect to income, but changes in prices have mixed effects among energy types. The welfare effect of the price changes on low-income households will be 9 times stronger than that on the mid-income households and 18 times on and the high-income households. This warrants a compensation package to make the reform socially acceptable. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Elasticities; Energy; Household budget; Market reform; Mexico; Welfare,Budget control; Commerce; Costs; Elasticity; Petroleum deposits; Power markets; Proven reserves; Energy; Household budget; Market reform; Me-xico; Welfare; Energy efficiency; demand elasticity; energy market; energy use; household energy; price dynamics; welfare impact; Mexico [North America],Article

The focus is on predicting the prices for the Pacific Gas and Company (PG&E) default load aggregation point (DLAP). Several effective features, such as the historical hourly prices at different locations, calender data, and new ancillary service requirements are engineered and the model is trained in order to capture the best relations between the features and the target electricity price variables. Insightful case studies are implemented on the CAISO market data from January 1, 2014 to February 28, 2016.

The information obtained from future electricity helps market participants to develop cost-effective bidding strategies to maximize their profit. Accurate price forecasting involves all market participants such as customer or producer in competitive electricity markets.

"Shrivastava N.A., Panigrahi B.K., Lim M.-H.",Electricity price classification using extreme learning machines,2016,13.0,"Forecasting electricity prices has been a widely investigated research issue in the deregulated power market scenario. High price volatilities, price spikes caused by a number of factors such as weather uncertainty, fluctuating fuel prices, transmission bottlenecks, etc., make the task of accurate price forecasting a formidable challenge for the market participants. A number of models have been proposed by researchers; however, achieving high accuracy is always not possible. In some specific applications such as self-scheduling by demand side participants, certain price thresholds are more useful than accurate price forecasts. In this paper, we have investigated the application of a novel neural network-based technique called extreme learning machine for the problem of classification of future electricity prices with respect to certain price thresholds. Different models corresponding to different lead times are developed and tested with data corresponding to Ontario and PJM markets. It is observed that classification with ELM is fast, less sensitive to user defined parameters and easily implementable. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.",Classification; Deregulation; Electricity price; Extreme learning machine; Neural networks,Classification (of information); Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Neural networks; Deregulated power markets; Electricity prices; Extreme learning machine; Forecasting electricity; Market participants; Novel neural network; Price forecasting; User-defined parameters; Learning systems,Article

We use multi-scale correlation analysis based on a modified method of time-dependent intrinsic correlation and the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise for this purpose. Three hypotheses on the type and strength of correlations in the short-, medium- and long-runs were tested. It is shown that price zones significantly differ in internal price-demand correlation structure over the comparable time scales, and not each of the theoretically formulated hypotheses is true for each of them. We can conclude that the answer to the question whether it is necessary to take into account the influence of demand-side on electricity spot prices over different time scales, is significantly dependent on the structure of electricity generation and consumption on the corresponding market. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity demand; Electricity spot price; Empirical mode decomposition; Price-demand correlation; Time-dependent intrinsic correlation; Trend estimation,Commerce; Correlation methods; Costs; Electric industry; Time measurement; Demand correlation; Electricity demands; Electricity spot price; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Time dependent; Trend estimation; Power markets; correlation; demand elasticity; demand-side management; electricity; electricity generation; energy market; price dynamics; trend analysis; Russian Federation,Article
"Cortazar G., Kovacevic I., Schwartz E.S.",Expected commodity returns and pricing models,2015,13.0,"Stochastic models of commodity prices have evolved considerably in terms of their structure and the number and interpretation of the state variables that model the underlying risk. Using multiple factors, different specifications and modern estimation techniques, these models have gained wide acceptance because of their success in accurately fitting the observed commodity futures' term structures and their dynamics. It is not well emphasized however that these models, in addition to providing the risk neutral distribution of future spot prices, also provide their true distribution. While the parameters of the risk neutral distribution are estimated more precisely and are usually statistically significant, some of the parameters of the true distribution are typically measured with large errors and are statistically insignificant. In this paper we argue that to increase the reliability of commodity pricing models, and therefore their use by practitioners, some of their parameters - in particular the risk premium parameters - should be obtained from other sources and we show that this can be done without losing any precision in the pricing of futures contracts. We show how the risk premium parameters can be obtained from estimations of expected futures returns and provide alternative procedures for estimating these expected futures returns. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Commodities; Futures; Oil,Contracts; Costs; Estimation; Parameter estimation; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Stochastic systems; Alternative procedures; Commodities; Commodity futures; Commodity pricing; Estimation techniques; Futures; Oil; Risk-neutral distribution; Stochastic models; commodity price; energy market; oil; pricing policy; reliability analysis; risk factor,Article
"Darudi A., Bashari M., Javidi M.H.",Electricity price forecasting using a new data fusion algorithm,2015,13.0,"Accurate price forecasting is crucial for all market participants in electricity markets. This study presents a hybrid price forecasting framework based on a new data fusion algorithm. Owing to the complexity and distinct nature of the electricity price, a single forecast engine cannot capture all different patterns of the price signals. Hence, this study focuses on a hybrid forecasting method to extract the advantages of several forecasting engines. In the proposed method, artificial neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and autoregressive moving average are employed as primary forecast engines (agents) which provide three independent price forecasts. Then, a new data fusion algorithm, the modified ordered weighted average (modified OWA), is proposed to combine the three forecasts to generate a single unified price forecast. Hopefully, the fusion's output outperforms all the agents' forecasts. The author's proposed fusion algorithm, unlike conventional OWA, uses the feedback from the agents' error. The proposed framework is evaluated on the Spanish electricity market. The results confirm the ability of the proposed fusion framework to provide more accurate forecasts compared with the input agents forecasts.

We present an analytical framework to quantify LMP sensitivity with respect to changes in sensor data. This framework consists of a unified LMP sensitivity matrix subject to sensor data corruption. This sensitivity matrix reflects a coupling among the sensor data, an estimation of the power system states, and the real-time LMP. The proposed framework offers system operators an online tool to: 1) quantify the impact of corrupted data at any sensor on LMP variations at any bus; 2) identify buses with LMPs highly sensitive to data corruption; and 3) find sensors that impact LMP changes significantly and influentially. It also allows system operators to evaluate the impact of SCADA data accuracy on real-time LMP.

Following neural net modeling of the data, we explore extreme price spikes through extreme value modeling, fitting a Generalized Pareto Distribution to price peaks over an estimated threshold. While neural nets capture the smoother aspects of spot price data, they are unable to capture local, volatile features that characterize electricity spot price data.

In particular, we focus on the economic impact of this circuit breaker-induced network topology error on locational marginal price (LMP).

We investigate this issue in the context of the Italian Power Exchange (IPEX), using data on the daily average day-ahead price (PUN) between April 2004 and December 2008. Estimates of baseline time series models (SARMAX and SARMAX-EGARCH) and their forecasting performances suggest that the trend in natural gas prices, market power indicators, deterministic weekly patterns, perceived temperatures, persistence in conditional volatility, and the inverse leverage effect are essential features of the PUN dynamics. We then augment the best-performing models with dummies that account for changes in the market architecture, such as the introduction of contracts for differences (CfDs) to support renewables, trading of white certificates for energy efficiency, and the demand-side liberalization. The findings show that changes in the market architecture affected both the PUN level and its volatility. Specifically, wholesale electricity prices and volatility appear to have decreased upon the introduction of CfDs, only to be pushed upwards following the start of white certificates' trading and retail liberalization. Moreover, after controlling for reforms the inverse leverage effect vanishes, and the persistence in volatility is lower than in the baseline estimates. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity prices; Policy; Time series,Commerce; Energy efficiency; Natural gas; Public policy; Time series; Electricity prices; Essential features; Forecasting performance; Market architectures; Perceived temperature; Time series models; White certificates; Wholesale electricity; Costs; commodity price; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy market; forecasting method; liberalization; natural gas; retailing; time series analysis; Italy,Article
"Chakravarty S., Dash P.K.",Dynamic filter weights neural network model integrated with differential evolution for day-ahead price forecasting in energy market,2011,13.0,"In this paper a new dynamic model for forecasting electricity prices from 1 to 24 h in advance is proposed. The model is a dynamic filter weight Adaline using a sliding mode weight adaptation technique. The filter weights for this neuron constitute of first order dynamic filter with adjustable parameters. Sliding mode invariance conditions determine a least square characterization of the adaptive weights average dynamics whose stability features may be studied using standard time varying linear system results. The approach is found to exhibit robustness characteristics and first convergence properties. Comparison of results with a local linear wavelet neural network model is also presented in this paper. The hourly electricity prices of California and Spanish energy markets are taken as experimental data and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are computed to find out the forecasting performance of both the models. In both the cases the MAPE and RMSE are found to be within the tolerable limits.

Based on the robust optimization (denoted as RO) methodology, a new self-scheduling model, which has a complicated max-min optimization structure, is set up.

IEEE 30-bus system is used to test the new model. Some comparisons with other methods are done, and the sensitivity with respect to the uncertain set is analyzed. Comparing with the existed uncertain self-scheduling approaches, the new method has twofold characteristics. First, it does not need a prediction of distribution of random variables and just requires an estimated value and the uncertain set of power price. Second, the counterpart of RO corresponding to the self-scheduling is a simple quadratic or quadratic cone programming. This indicates that the reformulated problem can be solved by many ordinary optimization algorithms. © 2011 Xiao Luo et al.",,Dual theory; Electricity market; Ellipsoidal uncertainties; Max-min; New model; Optimization algorithms; Power price; Programming problem; Quadratic cones; Robust optimization; Self-scheduling; Random variables; Structural optimization,Article
Georgilakis P.S.,Artificial intelligence solution to electricity price forecasting problem,2007,13.0,"The market-clearing prices in deregulated electricity markets are volatile. Good market-clearing price forecasting will help producers and consumers to prepare their corresponding bidding strategies so as to maximize their profits. Market-clearing price prediction is a difficult task since bidding strategies used by market participants are complicated and various uncertainties interact in an intricate way. This article proposes the use of two artificial neural networks: the first to predict the day-ahead load and the second to forecast the day-ahead market-clearing prices. The methodology is applied to the California power market. After determining the optimal artificial neural network architecture with the minimum mean absolute percentage error on the test set, this architecture is used for price forecasting in periods with price spikes, for price forecasting for weekends, and for week-ahead MCP forecasting during the four seasons of the year. The forecasting accuracy of the artificial neural network model is compared with the accuracy of the persistence method and the results prove the efficiency and practicality of the proposed technique.",,Costs; Electric utilities; Error analysis; Industrial economics; Mathematical models; Uncertainty analysis; Bidding strategies; Electricity prices; Neural networks,Article

"Zhang L., Luh P.B.",Power market clearing price prediction and confidence interval estimation with fast neural network learning,2002,13.0,"Market clearing prices (MCPs) play an important role in a deregulated power market, and good MCP prediction and interval estimation will help utilities and independent power producers submit effective bids with low risks in this uncertain market. Since MCP is a non-stationary process, an adaptive algorithm with fast convergence is important. A common method for MCP prediction is neural networks, and multilayer perceptron networks (MLP) is one of the widely used networks. Back propagation (BP) is a popular learning method for MLP, while BP suffers from slow convergence. This paper presents an integrated learning and interval estimation algorithm for MCP prediction. In the extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework, confidence interval is a natural by-product of EKF, and is integrated with learning process to improve learning results in addition to fast convergence. Since Kalman filter (KF) is a minimum variance estimator for linear system, EKF framework helps to provide a smaller confidence interval, which is preferred in risk management. Testing results on New England MCP prediction show the integrated learning and confidence interval algorithm provides better prediction than BP algorithm and the confidence interval is smaller with reasonable coverage than a Bayesian inference-based interval estimation method.",Confidence interval; Extended Kalman filter; Market clearing price; Neural networks; Power systems; Prediction methods; Risk management,Algorithms; Deregulation; Finance; Kalman filtering; Learning systems; Neural networks; Risk management; Price prediction; Electric power systems,Conference Paper
"Brusaferri A., Matteucci M., Portolani P., Vitali A.",Bayesian deep learning based method for probabilistic forecast of day-ahead electricity prices,2019,12.0,"The availability of accurate day-ahead energy prices forecasts is crucial to achieve a successful participation to liberalized electricity markets. Moreover, forecasting systems providing prediction intervals and densities (i.e. probabilistic forecasting)are fundamental to enable enhanced bidding and planning strategies considering uncertainty explicitly. Nonetheless, the vast majority of available approaches focus on point forecast. Therefore, we propose a novel methodology for probabilistic energy price forecast based on Bayesian deep learning techniques. A specific training method has been deployed to guarantee scalability to complex network architectures. Moreover, we developed a model originally supporting heteroscedasticity, thus avoiding the common homoscedastic assumption with related preprocessing effort. Experiments have been performed on two day-ahead markets characterized by different behaviors. Then, we demonstrated the capability of the proposed method to achieve robust performances in out-of-sample conditions while providing forecast uncertainty indications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Bayesian learning; Deep learning; Electricity price forecasting; Neural network; Probabilistic forecasting,Complex networks; Costs; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Learning systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Power markets; Bayesian learning; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast uncertainty; Learning-based methods; Liberalized electricity market; Planning strategies; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic forecasts; Deep learning; artificial neural network; Bayesian analysis; electricity generation; energy planning; learning; price determination; probability; training,Article
"Uniejewski B., Marcjasz G., Weron R.",On the importance of the long-term seasonal component in day-ahead electricity price forecasting: Part II — Probabilistic forecasting,2019,12.0,"A recent electricity price forecasting study has shown that the Seasonal Component AutoRegressive (SCAR) modeling framework, which consists of decomposing a series of spot prices into a trend-seasonal and a stochastic component, modeling them independently and then combining their forecasts, can yield more accurate point predictions than an approach in which the same autoregressive model is calibrated to the prices themselves. Here, we show that further accuracy gains can be achieved when the explanatory variables (load forecasts) are deseasonalized as well. More importantly, considering a novel extension of the SCAR concept to probabilistic forecasting and applying two methods of combining predictive distributions, we find that (i) SCAR-type models nearly always significantly outperform the autoregressive benchmark but are in turn outperformed by combined SCAR forecasts, (ii) predictive distributions computed using Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) outperform those obtained from historical simulation and bootstrap methods, and (iii) averaging over predictive distributions generally yields better probabilistic forecasts of electricity spot prices than averaging over quantiles. Given that probabilistic forecasting is a concept closely related to risk management, our study has important implications for risk officers and portfolio managers in the power sector. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity spot price; Long-term seasonal component; Pinball score; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA); Risk management; Seasonal Component AutoRegressive (SCAR) model,Costs; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Risk management; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Auto-regressive; Electricity spot price; Long-term seasonal component; Pinball score; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile regression; Power markets; electricity supply; forecasting method; numerical model; probability; regression analysis; seasonality; time series analysis,Article
"Anamika, Peesapati R., Kumar N.",Electricity Price Forecasting and Classification Through Wavelet-Dynamic Weighted PSO-FFNN Approach,2018,12.0,"In competitive electricity markets, accurate price forecasting is required to both power producers and consumers for planning their bidding strategies in order to maximize their own benefits. Price classification is an alternative approach to forecasting where the exact values of future prices are not mandatory. Presently, two efficient algorithms are proposed for both short term price forecasting (STPF) and classification (STPC) purposes. The algorithms include various methodologies like wavelet transform (WT), fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization (FA-PSO) and feed forward neural networks (FFNN). WT is utilized to convert the pathetic price series to an inviolable price series without losing the originality in the signal. Standard PSO (S-PSO) is implemented to tune the fixed architecture FFNN weights and biases. In the present nonlinear problem, linear variation of inertia weight does not resemble exact search process. Hence, dynamic inertia weight is accomplished by implementing the fuzzy systems in the S-PSO approach. The hybrid methodology is implemented on Spanish electricity markets for the year 2002. To validate, three types of price classes and historical price series that are utilized by many researches as input features, are considered. Various statistical indicators are evaluated to compare and validate the proposed approaches with the past approaches available in the literature survey. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",Forecasting; fuzzy systems; neural networks (NN); particle swarm optimization (PSO); wavelet transform (WT),Biological systems; Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Neurons; Power markets; Wavelet transforms; Auto regressive process; Biological system modeling; Computational model; Neural network (nn); Predictive models; Particle swarm optimization (PSO),Article
"Unger E.A., Ulfarsson G.F., Gardarsson S.M., Matthiasson T.",The effect of wind energy production on cross-border electricity pricing: The case of western Denmark in the Nord Pool market,2018,12.0,"The aim of this analysis was to estimate the effect of planned cross-border energy flow and different levels of predicted wind energy share with respect to the three pricing outcomes (higher price, lower price, or equal prices) that can occur between a pair of trading partners in the Nordic day-ahead spot market. The analysis covers a four-year period (2012–2015). Three multinomial logit models were designed, one for trade with each of western Denmark's (DK1) Nord Pool day-ahead spot market trading partners: eastern Denmark (DK2); southern Norway (NO2); and Stockholm, Sweden (SE3). It was found that both wind energy production and planned energy cross-border flow have a large effect on the probabilities of the pricing outcomes, with greater wind energy production in DK1 linked to lower prices in DK1 and lower wind energy linked to higher prices in DK1, although the effects varied considerably across trading partners. For example, if western Denmark's wind share of production was less than 33%, on average there was a 253% increase in the probability of DK1 having a higher price than NO2, and, in the SE3 model, this corresponding value was 359.8%, which encourages trading behavior to reduce the price differences. However, the existence of such large price differences suggests that interconnector transmission capacity or trading volume is not enough to balance the price in these circumstances. Overall, the results support the conclusion that increased interconnection can reduce price differences. © 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland",Europe; Market coupling; Nord Pool; Renewable energy; Wind energy,,Article
"Kühnlenz F., Nardelli P.H.J., Karhinen S., Svento R.",Implementing flexible demand: Real-time price vs. market integration,2018,12.0,"This paper proposes an agent-based model that combines both spot and balancing electricity markets. From this model, we develop a multi-agent simulation to study the integration of the consumers’ flexibility into the system. Our study identifies the conditions that real-time prices may lead to higher electricity costs, which in turn contradicts the usual claim that such a pricing scheme reduces cost. We show that such undesirable behavior is in fact systemic. Due to the existing structure of the wholesale market, the predicted demand that is used in the formation of the price is never realized since the flexible users will change their demand according to such established price. As the demand is never correctly predicted, the volume traded through the balancing markets increases, leading to higher overall costs. In this case, the system can sustain, and even benefit from, a small number of flexible users, but this solution can never upscale without increasing the total costs. To avoid this problem, we implement the so-called “exclusive groups”. Our results illustrate the importance of rethinking the current practices so that flexibility can be successfully integrated considering scenarios with and without intermittent renewable sources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Balancing market; Day-ahead market; Demand response; Market design; Real-time pricing; Smart grid,Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Multi agent systems; Balancing market; Day ahead market; Demand response; Market design; Real time pricing; Smart grid; Costs; cost analysis; demand-side management; electricity; energy market; energy use; market conditions; market system; price determination; pricing policy; real time; simulation,Article
"Golmohamadi H., Keypour R.",A bi-level robust optimization model to determine retail electricity price in presence of a significant number of invisible solar sites,2018,12.0,"This paper presents a bi-level model for day-ahead electricity pricing and dispatch problems faced by a distributed generation (DG)-owning retailer who plays an intermediary role between the wholesale electricity market and end-use consumers. In this approach, the stochastic programming is addressed in the upper level to study behavior of the retailer in the wholesale electricity market in presence of self-generation facilities, including thermal DGs, wind farms and roof-top photovoltaic (RPV) sites. Regarding increased penetration of RPV sites, a data dimension reduction technique through k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) methods is used to hedge against large-scale output power data of RPV sites. In addition, to forecast day-ahead power output of RPV sites, a similar-day detection (SDD) technique is addressed to investigate the impacts of climate variables, e.g. irradiation, sunshine hours and temperature, on 24-hour-ahead power of RPV sites. In the lower level problem, information gap decision theory (IGDT) is proposed to determine robustness of retail electricity price against uncertain clients’ consumption. In this way, robustness and opportuneness functions are discussed to evaluate immunity against failure and windfall reward, respectively. Finally, numerical results based on actual data from PJM market and North Carolina solar sites are presented to demonstrate the usefulness and proficiency of the proposed framework. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price; Retailer; Robust; Roof-top solar sites; Stochastic,,Article

In this article, a new forecasting strategy is proposed for short-term prediction of the electricity price, which is a complex quantity with nonlinear, volatile and time-dependent behaviour. Our forecast strategy includes two novelties: a new two-stage feature selection algorithm and a new iterative training algorithm. The feature selection algorithm has two filtering stages to remove irrelevant and redundant candidate inputs, respectively. This algorithm is based on mutual information and correlation analysis. The improved iterative training algorithm is composed of two neural networks in which the output of the first neural network is one of the inputs to the second.

"Rafiei M., Niknam T., Khooban M.H.",A novel intelligent strategy for probabilistic electricity price forecasting: Wavelet neural network based modified dolphin optimization algorithm,2016,12.0,"To simplify decision making of market participants, a careful and reliable electricity market price forecasting method is indispensable. Nevertheless, due to the Instability in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather tough to forecast MCPs accurately. Using probabilistic forecasting is a new solution to overcome the low accuracy of forecast. Transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts is too important to model the uncertainties of forecasts. Thus the decision making activities of market participants are supported against uncertainties and risks effectively. In this paper a hybrid approach to achieve prediction intervals (PIs) of MCPs is proposed that modified dolphin echolocation optimization algorithm (MDEOA) is applied to estimate point forecasts, model uncertainties, and noise variance. This proposed electricity price probabilistic forecasting method is evaluated by a generalized and comprehensive framework. To test the proposed hybrid method, real price data from Ontario, New England, and, Australian electricity markets are used and effectiveness of the method is validated. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.",modified dolphin echolocation optimization algorithm; prediction intervals; Probabilistic forecasting; wavelet neural network; wavelet preprocessing,Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Dolphins (structures); Optimization; Power markets; Sonar; Uncertainty analysis; Optimization algorithms; Prediction interval; Probabilistic forecasting; Wavelet neural networks; Wavelet pre-processing; Forecasting,Article
"Feijoo F., Silva W., Das T.K.",A computationally efficient electricity price forecasting model for real time energy markets,2016,12.0,"Increased significance of demand response and proliferation of distributed energy resources will continue to demand faster and more accurate models for forecasting locational marginal prices. This paper presents such a model (named K-SVR). While yielding prediction accuracy comparable with the best known models in the literature, K-SVR requires a significantly reduced computational time. The computational reduction is attained by eliminating the use of a feature selection process, which is commonly used by the existing models in the literature. K-SVR is a hybrid model that combines clustering algorithms, support vector machine, and support vector regression. K-SVR is tested using Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland market data from the periods 2005-6, 2011-12, and 2014-15. Market data from 2006 has been used to measure performance of many of the existing models. Authors chose these models to compare performance and demonstrate strengths of K-SVR.

First, a single input and multi-output (SIMO) model for typical CHPs is established, considering the varying ratio between heat and electricity outputs at different loading levels. Then, the energy prices are forecasted with a gray forecasting model and revised in real-time based on the actual prices by using the least squares method. At last, a discrete optimization model and corresponding dynamic programming algorithm are developed to design the optimal operation strategies for CHPs in real-time. Based on the forecasted prices, the potential operating strategy which may produce the maximum profits is pre-developed. Dynamic modification is then conducted to adjust the pre-developed operating strategy after the actual prices are known. The proposed method is implemented on a 1 MW CHP on a typical day. Results show the optimized profits comply well with those derived from real-time prices after considering dynamic modification process. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Combined heat and power (CHP); Discrete optimization; Dynamic programming; Price forecasting; Real-time market,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Power markets; Profitability; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power system; Deregulated energy market; Discrete optimization; Dynamic programming algorithm; Optimal operation strategy; Price forecasting; Real-time market; Dynamic programming,Article
Joëts M.,"Heterogeneous beliefs, regret, and uncertainty: The role of speculation in energy price dynamics",2015,12.0,"This paper proposes to investigate the impact of financialization on energy markets (oil, gas, coal, and electricity European forward prices) during both normal times and periods of extreme fluctuation by using an original behavioral and emotional approach. With this aim, we propose a new theoretical and empirical framework based on a heterogeneous agents model in which fundamentalists and chartists co-exist and are subject to regret and uncertainty. We find significant evidence that energy markets are composed of heterogeneous traders who behave differently depending on the intensity of the price fluctuations and the uncertainty context. In particular, energy prices are governed primarily by fundamental and chartist agents that are neutral to uncertainty during normal times, whereas these prices face irrational chartist investors averse to uncertainty during periods of extreme fluctuations. In this context, the recent surge in energy prices can be viewed as the consequence of irrational exuberance. Our new theoretical model is suitable for modeling energy price dynamics and outperforms both the random walk and the ARMA model in out-of-sample predictive ability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) withinthe International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

"Cox M., Peichl A., Pestel N., Siegloch S.",Labor demand effects of rising electricity prices: Evidence for Germany,2014,12.0,"Germany continues to play a pioneering role in replacing conventional power plants with renewable energy sources. While this might be beneficial with respect to environmental quality, it also implies increasing electricity prices. The extent to which this is associated with negative impacts on employment depends on the interrelationship between labor and electricity as input factors in the production process. In this paper, we estimate cross-price elasticities between electricity and heterogeneous labor for the German manufacturing sector. We use administrative linked employer-employee micro-data combined with information on sector-level electricity prices and usage over the period 2003-2007. We find positive, but small conditional cross-price elasticities of labor demand with respect to electricity prices, which means that electricity as an input factor can be replaced by labor to a limited extent when the production level is held constant. In the case of adjustable output, we find negative unconditional cross-price elasticities, implying that higher electricity prices lead to output reductions and to lower labor demand, with low- and high-skilled workers being affected more than medium-skilled. Resulting adverse distributional effects and potential overall job losses may pose challenges for policy-makers in securing public support for the German energy turnaround. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity prices; Employment; Energy; Germany; Labor demand,Elasticity; Employment; Renewable energy resources; Conventional power plants; Cross-price elasticity; Electricity prices; Energy; Germany; Labor demands; Linked employer employees; Renewable energy source; Costs; alternative energy; demand analysis; electricity supply; employment; energy market; labor market; labor supply; price dynamics; renewable resource; Germany,Article
"Young D., Poletti S., Browne O.",Can agent-based models forecast spot prices in electricity markets? Evidence from the New Zealand electricity market,2014,12.0,"Modelling price formation in electricity markets is a notoriously difficult process, due to physical constraints on electricity generation and transmission, and the potential for market power. This difficulty has inspired the recent development of bottom-up agent-based algorithmic learning models of electricity markets. While these have proven quite successful in small models, few authors have attempted any validation of their model against real-world data in a more realistic model. In this paper we develop the SWEM model, where we take one of the most promising algorithms from the literature, a modified version of the Roth and Erev algorithm, and apply it to a 19-node simplification of the New Zealand electricity market. Once key variables such as water storage are accounted for, we show that our model can closely mimic short-run (weekly) electricity prices at these 19 nodes, given fundamental inputs such as fuel costs, network data, and demand. We show that agents in SWEM are able to manipulate market power when a line outage makes them an effective monopolist in the market. SWEM has already been applied to a wide variety of policy applications in the New Zealand market.22. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based modelling; Electricity markets; Power trading,Computational methods; Costs; Digital storage; Electric industry; Fuel storage; Outages; Agent-based model; Agent-based modelling; Algorithmic learning; Electricity generation; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Physical constraints; Power trading; New zealand; Spot price; Commerce; algorithm; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; model validation; modeling; price dynamics; electricity generation; energy policy; New Zealand,Article
Saâdaoui F.,The Price and Trading Volume Dynamics Relationship in the EEX Power Market: A Wavelet Modeling,2013,12.0,"This paper examines the dynamic relationship between power spot prices and related trading volumes in one of the most emergent energy markets. Traditionally, investigating the bivariate stochastic processes has been dominated by linear econometrical methods that proved helpful especially in finance. However, when dealing with intradaily power data, we cannot rely on models developed for financial or other commodity markets. Therefore, wavelet transforms are applied for power markets data to search for and decode nonlinear regularities and hidden patterns existing between the variables. Given its ability to decompose the time series into their time scale components and thus to reveal structure at different time horizons, wavelets are useful in analyzing situations in which the degree of association between processes is likely to change with the time-horizon. Therefore, a wavelet-based cross-analysis is performed between prices and trading volume time series. On the same basis, causality tests and out-of-sample forecasting tasks are carried out to empirically the strong relationship between the two investigated time series. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Electricity spot prices; European energy markets; Forecasting; Maximum overlapped discrete wavelet transform; Multiscale causality; Trading volume; Wavelet cross-correlation,,Article

The dynamics of the power market are assumed to be a Markov decision process (MDP) by modeling the power load evolution as a two-state Markov chain. The fundamental elements of the MDP are discussed and the optimal strategy is obtained from dynamic programming. Due to the curse of dimensions, the myopic strategy is proposed to significantly simplify the algorithm. The validity of the proposed scheduling algorithm is demonstrated using numerical simulations.

Therefore, generation companies need accurate price forecasting tools. Comparison of neural network and auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to forecast commodity prices in pervious researches showed that the artificial neural network (ANN) forecasts were considerably more accurate than traditional ARIMA models. This paper provides an accurate and efficient tool for shortterm price forecasting based on the combination of ANN and ARIMA. Firstly, input variables for ANN are determined by time series analysis. This model relates the current prices to the values of past prices. Secondly, ANN is used for one day-ahead price forecasting. A three-layered feed-forward neural network algorithm is used for forecasting next-day electricity prices. The ANN model is then trained and tested using data from electricity market of Iran. According to pervious studies, in the case of neural networks and ARIMA models, historical demand data do not significantly improve predictions. The results show that the combined ANN-ARIMA forecasts prices with high accuracy for short-term periods. Also, it is shown that policy-making strategies would be enhanced due to increased precision and reliability.

"Haghi H.V., Tafreshi S.M.M.",An overview and verification of electricity price forecasting models,2007,12.0,"Many methods and models have been developed to forecast the energy prices in the market environment since the restructuring of the electricity power industry. This paper presents a brief overview of different techniques and models in the literature of energy price forecasting. Then it compares and classifies different models and methods to verify whether these are suitable for different purposes of forecasting or not. Classification is based on the type of the models, suitability with respect to power market, time horizon, level of accuracy and forecasting aim. Based on this approach, a complementary classification of price forecasting models is proposed, which can be used for choosing the suitable method for certain cases. Also, the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM), as an interesting method, is proposed in detail with a modeling and simulation by using the Spanish electricity market data. © 2007 RPS.",Energy price forecasting; Hidden Markov Models; Price models verification; Time series,Classification (of information); Costs; Electricity; Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Energy price forecasting; Energy pricing; Power engineering; Price models verification; Time series; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper
"Guo J.-J., Luh P.B.",Market clearing price prediction using a committee machine with adaptive weighting coefficients,2002,12.0,"The use of a committee machine composed of multiple neural networks can capture more features in data and overcome the inadequacy of a single network. Different neural networks, however, may capture different features in data, and result in different inferences and predictions. Furthermore, network performance may not be constant as input features change. Without information on prediction quality of individual networks, it is difficult to appropriately combine them in a committee machine. To overcome the difficulty, insightful information called the prediction confidence is introduced and an associated method of determining adaptive weighting coefficients is developed in this paper. The key idea is that the confidence of a prediction is measured by the inverse of a prediction variance. Adaptive weighting coefficients are then derived to depend on past network performance and the confidence of current predictions. Therefore, a committee machine can properly determine coefficients according to past performance and prediction confidence of networks. The effectiveness of a new combination method is illustrated by power market cleaning price prediction.",Committee machines; Market clearing price forecasting; Neural networks,Approximation theory; Data acquisition; Forecasting; Probability; Problem solving; Committee machines; Price forecasting; Neural networks,Article
Templet P.H.,Energy price disparity and public welfare,2001,12.0,"The differences in the price of energy to economic sectors are linked to a number of system parameters and to public welfare. There are large disparities in energy prices within states when comparing residential and industrial prices although neoclassical economics predicts one price in markets. The large disparities between the two sectors across states negatively affects the efficiency of resource allocation, creates subsidies for those getting the cheap energy and results in unequal access to energy. These in turn lead to inefficient partitioning of energy between products and waste, higher pollution, leakage of wealth and poorer energy use efficiency, i.e. high energy intensity. States with large energy price disparities between sectors have statistically higher poverty, lower incomes, more pollution and use more energy but with less efficiency. Higher energy price disparities also result in higher throughput per unit of output thus reducing the chances for sustainability and lower public welfare. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Diversity; Energy; Energy intensity; Price disparity; Sustainability; Welfare,energy market; income; price dynamics; welfare economics,Article
"Cheng H., Ding X., Zhou W., Ding R.",A hybrid electricity price forecasting model with Bayesian optimization for German energy exchange,2019,11.0,"Electricity price forecasting affects the operation of the entire electricity market and it is extremely important to every market participant. In this paper, a novel hybrid method, with using empirical wavelet transform (EWT), support vector regression (SVR), Bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and Bayesian optimization (BO), is proposed to increase the accuracy of electricity price forecasting. First, EWT is used as a processing tool to decompose the original signal into specific modal components according to the characteristics of the signal itself. Then, considering the complexity of forecasting nonlinear subseries, SVR and BiLSTM are used as basic framework to forecast the nonlinear subseries. At the same time, BO is introduced to adjust parameters and optimize model performance. In last, the final prediction results are combined by the prediction results of different models. The proposed hybrid model is employed on the data gathered from the European Power Exchange Spot (EPEXSPOT). Five different case studies are adopted to verify the effectiveness of BO, EWT and hybrid model respectively. Statistical tests of experimental results compared with other situations demonstrated the proposed hybrid model can achieve a better forecasting performance. © 2019",Bayesian optimization; Bi-directional long short-term memory; Electricity price forecasting; Empirical wavelet transform; Time series analysis,Brain; Commerce; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Signal processing; Time series analysis; Wavelet transforms; Bayesian optimization; Bi-directional; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting performance; Market participants; Model performance; Processing tools; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets,Article

"Amountzias C., Dagdeviren H., Patokos T.",Pricing decisions and market power in the uk electricity market: A VECM approach,2017,11.0,"This paper examines the influence of market power in the formation of retail and wholesale electricity prices in the UK over 1998–2012 on the basis of Vector Error Correction model (VECM). Market power is measured as the influence of the market share of the Big Six in a dynamic demand and supply VECM. The findings indicate that market power of the Big Six in the wholesale industry has a significant and large positive influence on the wholesale mark-up in the short-run. The long-run estimates support the arguments about ‘revenue rebalancing’ resulting from vertical integration. That is, low market power (and hence low revenues) in the wholesale industry leads to higher prices (hence higher revenues) in the retail industry. These findings are in contrast to the CMA's finding that no market power is exercised in the wholesale industry. Retail electricity prices are affected directly by both the wholesale and retail market concentration ratios in the long-run rather than indirectly through the wholesale mark-up. Overall, the findings in this paper provide support for the view that the UK electricity market exhibits significant anti-competitive conduct in both the retail and wholesale segments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity; Market power; Retail; The Big Six; UK; Wholesale,Competition; Costs; Economics; Electric industry; Electricity; Error correction; Power markets; Sales; Electricity prices; Market Power; Retail; The Big Six; Vector error correction model; Vertical integration; Wholesale; Wholesale electricity; Commerce; competition (economics); electricity; energy market; error correction; numerical model; price dynamics; retailing; vector; vertical integration; United Kingdom,Article
"Manner H., Türk D., Eichler M.",Modeling and forecasting multivariate electricity price spikes,2016,11.0,"We consider the problem of forecasting the occurrence of extreme prices in the Australian electricity markets from high frequency spot prices. In particular, we are interested in the simultaneous occurrence of such so-called spikes in two or more markets. Our approach is based on a novel dynamic model for multivariate binary outcomes, which allows the latent variables driving these observed outcomes to follow a vector autoregressive process. Furthermore the model is constructed using a copula representation for the joint distribution of the resulting innovations. This has several advantages over the standard multivariate probit model. First, it allows for nonlinear dependence between the error terms. Second, the distribution of the latent errors can be chosen freely. Third, the computational burden can be greatly reduced making estimation feasible in higher dimensions and for large samples. The model is applied to spikes in half-hourly electricity prices in four interconnected Australian markets. The multivariate model provides a superior fit compared to single-equation models and generates better forecasts for spike probabilities. Furthermore, evidence of spillover dynamics between the markets is revealed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Copulas; Electricity price spikes; Multivariate binary choice models; Vector autoregression,Bins; Commerce; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Australian electricity market; Auto regressive process; Binary choice models; Copulas; Electricity price spikes; Modeling and forecasting; Multivariate modeling; Vector autoregressions; Costs; electricity supply; energy market; modeling; multivariate analysis; price dynamics; vector autoregression; Australia,Article

Over the traditional GM(0, N) model, three major improvements of the proposed model are: (i) the lower and upper bounds are firstly identified to give an interval estimation of the forecasting value; (ii) a novel whitenization method is then established to determine the definite forecasting value from the forecasting interval; and (iii) the model parameters are identified by an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) instead of the least square method (LSM) for the limitation of LSM. Finally, a newly-reformed electricity market in Yunnan province of China is studied, and input variables are contrapuntally selected. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by observed data. Compared with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, the traditional GM(0, N) model and the artificial neural network (ANN) model, the proposed model gives a better performance and its superiority is further ensured by the use of the modified Diebold-Mariano (MDM) test, suggesting that it is suitable for mid-term electricity MCP forecasting in a data-sparse electricity market. © 2016 by the authors.",Grey prediction model; Market clearing price (MCP); Mid-term; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sparse data,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Linear regression; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); System theory; Artificial neural network models; Grey prediction model; Lower and upper bounds; Market Clearing Price; Market clearing prices; Mid-term; Multiple linear regression models; Sparse data; Power markets,Article

Yet, accurate price forecasting is expected to provide crucial information, needed by power producers and consumers to bid strategically, thereby decreasing their risks and increasing their profits in the electricity market.

"Grimes D., Ifrim G., O'Sullivan B., Simonis H.",Analyzing the impact of electricity price forecasting on energy cost-aware scheduling,2014,11.0,"Energy cost-aware scheduling, i.e., scheduling that adapts to real-time energy price volatility, can save large energy consumers millions of dollars every year in electricity costs. Energy price forecasting coupled with energy price-aware scheduling, is a step toward this goal. In this work, we study cost-aware schedules and the effect of various price forecasting schemes on the end schedule-cost. We show that simply optimizing price forecasts based on classical regression error metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error), does not work well for scheduling. Price forecasts that do result in significantly better schedules, optimize a combination of metrics, each having a different impact on the end-schedule-cost. For example, both price estimation and price ranking are important for scheduling, but they carry different weight. We consider day-ahead energy price forecasting using the Irish Single Electricity Market as a case-study, and test our price forecasts for two real-world scheduling applications: animal feed manufacturing and home energy management systems. We show that price forecasts that co-optimize price estimation and price ranking, result in significant energy-cost savings. We believe our results are relevant for many real-life scheduling applications that are currently plagued with very large energy bills. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"Pashardes P., Pashourtidou N., Zachariadis T.",Estimating welfare aspects of changes in energy prices from preference heterogeneity,2014,11.0,"The European Union's energy and climate policy package is expected to cause an increase in end-user prices of electricity and fuels. This paper assesses the distributional effects of these price increases in Cyprus by specifying and estimating a consumer demand system with price heterogeneity between households. This novel method allows obtaining robust parameter estimates even when household expenditure surveys are limited, as is the case in many European countries. The empirical analysis is conducted both conditional on energy-related household characteristics and unconditionally. We then use the estimated demand system to conduct welfare analysis. We find that the rise in energy prices results in welfare losses of EUR 101 per household (in 2009 prices) in year 2020, or a nationwide welfare loss of more than EUR'2009 33 million. Price increases will be regressive and will affect small and urban households more strongly than the rest of the population. Furthermore, we find that the largest proportion of welfare loss is due to loss of household's income purchasing power caused by higher energy prices, while the changes in relative prices induce deadweight loss which is a small part of welfare loss because of the limited substitutability of energy with other goods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Climate policy; Deadweight loss; Demand system; Distributional effect,Climate policy; Demand system; Distributional effect; Empirical analysis; Energy and climate policies; European Countries; Household expenditure surveys; Preference heterogeneity; Cost accounting; Costs; demand analysis; energy market; energy policy; environmental policy; European Union; heterogeneity; household income; price dynamics; purchasing power parity; welfare economics; Cyprus,Article
"Wang Z., Liu F., Wu J., Wang J.",A hybrid forecasting model based on bivariate division and a backpropagation artificial neural network optimized by chaos particle swarm optimization for day-ahead electricity price,2014,11.0,"In the electricity market, the electricity price plays an inevitable role. Nevertheless, accurate price forecasting, a vital factor affecting both government regulatory agencies and public power companies, remains a huge challenge and a critical problem. Determining how to address the accurate forecasting problem becomes an even more significant task in an era in which electricity is increasingly important. Based on the chaos particle swarm optimization (CPSO), the backpropagation artificial neural network (BPANN), and the idea of bivariate division, this paper proposes a bivariate division BPANN (BD-BPANN) method and the CPSO-BD-BPANN method for forecasting electricity price. The former method creatively transforms the electricity demand and price to be a new variable, named DV, which is calculated using the division principle, to forecast the day-ahead electricity by multiplying the forecasted values of the DVs and forecasted values of the demand. Next, to improve the accuracy of BD-BPANN, chaos particle swarm optimization and BD-BPANN are synthesized to form a novel model, CPSO-BD-BPANN. In this study, CPSO is utilized to optimize the initial parameters of BD-BPANN to make its output more stable than the original model. Finally, two forecasting strategies are proposed regarding different situations. © 2014 Zhilong Wang et al.",,,Article
"Xu Z.-Y., Xu W.-S., Shao W.-H., Zeng Z.-Y.",Real-time pricing control on generation-side: Optimal demand-tracking model and information fusion estimation solver,2014,11.0,"This paper develops the information fusion based pricing control (IFPC) scheme for the generation-side in the liberalized wholesale electricity market. The market mechanism is described by a feedback system, in which the independent system operator (ISO) interacts with generation companies (GenCOs) via proposing and responding to real-time nodal prices. The linear constrained quadratic optimal tracking problem is formulated; and the solution (nodal price sequence) is repeatedly computed by fusing the recently available information with backward manner and updated over the receding preview horizon. So that the total supply dynamically tracks the demand, the price is stationarized and each GenCO gains the maximal profit for the given price. Numeric results on a 118-bus network validate IFPC's effectiveness and flexibility on incorporating various line rating constraints as well as wind power fluctuation uncertainties. Comparative study demonstrates that IFPC outperforms the negotiated predictive dispatch but elapsing heavier computations. The irrational behavior analysis verifies the convergence to equilibrium; and speculation behavior of GenCOs in the real market is also discussed. Along with the rapid development of smart grid, IFPC is practically enabled by the information and communication technology (ICT); its significance and potentials for renewable energy sources (RES) integration would be realized and exploited. © 2014 IEEE.",Information fusion; liberalized electricity market; pricing control; profit maximization; quadratic optimal tracking problem; receding preview horizon,Commerce; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Information fusion; Information technology; Profitability; Quadratic programming; Wind power; Liberalized electricity market; Pricing control; Profit maximization; Quadratic-optimal; receding preview horizon; Costs,Article

The paper is focused on balancing markets pricing policies. The proposal of a new imbalance price scheme is included and conveniently evaluated. This proposed scheme tries to minimise the use of ancillary services to compensate for deviations in searching for a more efficient market design. The effectiveness of imbalance prices as market signals is also examined, and policy recommendations regarding imbalance services are discussed. Two test cases are included that analyse the participation of a wind power producer in the Spanish electricity market using a stochastic optimisation strategy. For this purpose, the uncertainty of the variables is considered, i.e., wind power production and prediction, intraday and imbalance prices. Test cases were run with real data for 10 months, and realistic results are presented along with a hypothetical test case. The regulation of the imbalance prices may not be adequate for the Spanish electricity market because an error drop is not sufficiently encouraged. Therefore, we suggest the application of a new imbalance price scheme, which includes an additional constraint. The conclusions of this paper can be assumed to be general policy recommendations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Imbalance price scheme; Optimisation; Wind energy,Ancillary service; Electricity market; Imbalance price scheme; Optimisations; Policy recommendations; Spanish electricity markets; Stochastic optimisation; Wind power production; Commerce; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Optimization; Wind power; Costs; electricity supply; energy market; optimization; price dynamics; pricing policy; stochasticity; wind power; Spain,Article
"Warrington J., Mariéthoz S., Morari M.",Negotiated predictive dispatch: Receding horizon nodal electricity pricing for wind integration,2011,11.0,"Rapid wind fluctuations make the systematic operation of electricity markets with high wind power penetration difficult. A novel dynamic pricing mechanism is presented, which uses a receding horizon principle to allow forecasts of wind power and demand to be incorporated as soon as they are available, and is shown to be capable of reducing dispatch costs on the hours timescale in volatile wind conditions. Incorporating a time horizon is shown to allow market participants to plan generator ramping decisions and storage operation better than when prices are set in a decoupled manner for sequential time steps. The scheme repeatedly updates proposed prices based on the degree to which the corresponding power outputs planned by the market participants violate constraints on the transmission network.

"Black J.W., Tyagi R.",Potential problems with large scale differential pricing programs,2010,11.0,"Flat rate prices for residential customers have historically enhanced the ability of system operators to predict demand by providing a smooth, certain price signal, thus reducing risk in meeting the need to instantaneously balance supply and demand in electricity systems/markets. The desire to reduce peak loads, however, has lead to exploration of dynamic pricing, including time of use and critical peak pricing programs. These programs are currently in the pilot stage throughout the US, with low overall participation by residential load. Large-scale participation in dynamic pricing programs can cause unwanted consequences that will not be observed in small-scale programs. This paper investigates several potential negative consequences from large-scale participation in existing dynamic pricing programs. These include: the rebound effect, coincident load shifting/shedding, and limitations of fixed, uniform pricing periods. © 2010 IEEE.",Critical peak pricing; Demand response; Dynamic pricing; Power distribution reliability; Power system reliability; Time of use pricing,Critical peak pricing; Demand response; Dynamic pricing; Power distribution reliability; Power system reliability; Time-of-use pricing; Dynamic response; Economics; Reliability; Costs,Conference Paper
"Mandal P., Srivastava A.K., Negnevitsky M., Park J.-W.",Sensitivity analysis of neural network parameters to improve the performance of electricity price forecasting,2009,11.0,"This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of neural network (NN) parameters to improve the performance of electricity price forecasting. The presented work is an extended version of previous works done by authors to integrate NN and similar days (SD) method for predicting electricity prices. Focus here is on sensitivity analysis of NN parameters while keeping the parameters same for SD to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in the PJM market. Sensitivity analysis of NN parameters include back-propagation learning set (BP-set), learning rate (η), momentum (α) and NN learning days (dN N). The SD parameters, i.e. time framework of SD (d = 45 days) and number of selected similar price days (N=5) are kept constant for all the simulated cases. Forecasting performance is carried out by choosing two different days from each season of the year 2006 and for which, the NN parameters for the base case are considered as BP-set=500, η=0.8, α=0.1 and dNN = 45 days. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the value of BP-set (500, 1000, 1500); η (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2), α (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and dNN (15, 30, 45 and 60 days). The most favorable value of BP-set is first found out from the sensitivity analysis followed by that of η and α, and based on which the best value of dNN is determined. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the best value of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained when BP-set = 500, η= 0.8, α=0.1 and dNN = 60 days for winter season. For spring, summer and autumn, these values are 500, 0.6, 0.1 and 45 days, respectively. MAPE, forecast mean square error and mean absolute error of reasonably small value are obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. Numerical results show that forecasts generated by developed NN model based on the most favorable case are accurate and efficient.

"Mandal P., Senjyu T., Urasaki N., Yona A., Funabashi T., Srivastava A.K.",Price forecasting for day-ahead electricity market using recursive neural network,2007,11.0,"Price forecasting has become a very valuable tool in the current upheaval of electricity market deregulation. It plays an important role in power system planning and operation, risk assessment and other decision making. This paper provides a method for predicting hourly prices in the day-ahead electricity market using Recursive Neural Network (RNN) technique, which is based on similar days approach. RNN is a multi-step approach based on one output node, which uses the previous prediction as input for the subsequent forecasts. In this way, it is carried out recursively for twenty four steps to predict next 24 hour prices. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed RNN model with similar days along with other literature is presented. The proposed method is examined on the PJM electricity market. The results obtained through the simulation show that the proposed RNN model can provide efficient, accurate and better results. © 2007 IEEE.",Electricity market; Price forecasting; Recursive neural network; Similar days,Electricity; Marketing; Neural networks; Risk assessment; Electricity market; Price forecasting; Similar days; Costs,Conference Paper

"Yang W., Wang J., Niu T., Du P.",A novel system for multi-step electricity price forecasting for electricity market management,2020,10.0,"Electricity price forecasting is an important and challenging issue for all participants in the power market because of the wide application of electricity in our society and its inherent features. In this context, some current forecasting systems use data preprocessing and optimization for theoretical and practical achievements. However, some limitations to these systems exist which need to be urgently solved. First, future information is overdrawn in the data preprocessing stage of these forecasting systems, which is actually unknown in practical applications. The crucial question, therefore, is how to develop a forecasting system without using any future information. Second, the complex features of original nonlinear and nonstationary electricity price have a negative influence on the generalization ability of these previously developed models. To decrease the negative effects on management, a method to develop a forecasting system to improve the model's generalization ability is required. Therefore, in this study, we developed an adaptive deterministic and probabilistic interval forecasting system for multi-step electricity price forecasting, which can present more valuable information to power market decision makers. Two cases and one comparative study are provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the developed system in multi-step electricity price forecasting. Furthermore, further discussions are presented to illustrate the significance of this study, thus proving that the results of the present study fill the present knowledge gap and provide some new future directions for related studies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Deterministic forecasting; Electricity market; Electricity price; Interval forecasting; Multi-step forecasting,Commerce; Decision making; Electric industry; Forecasting; Comparative studies; Deterministic forecasting; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting system; Generalization ability; Interval forecasting; Multi-step forecasting; Power markets,Article

We computed thousands of tests regarding the machine learning parameters combinations as there is no method to set the optimal structure for these models. The results show that machine learning methods outperform traditional econometric methods and also that they present an additional advantage, which is the capacity to predict turning points.

"Luo S., Weng Y.",A two-stage supervised learning approach for electricity price forecasting by leveraging different data sources,2019,10.0,"Over the years, the growing penetration of renewable energy into the electricity market has resulted in a significant change in the electricity market price. This change makes the existing forecasting method prone to error, decreasing the economic benefits. Hence, more precise forecasting methods need to be developed. This paper starts with a survey and benchmark of existing machine learning approaches for forecasting the real-time market (RTM) price. While these methods provide sufficient modeling capability via supervised learning, their accuracy is still limited due to the single data source, e.g., historical price information only. In this paper, a novel two-stage supervised learning approach is proposed by diversifying the data sources such as highly correlated power data. This idea is inspired by the recent load forecasting methods that have shown extremely well performances. Specifically, the proposed two-stage method, namely the rerouted method, learns two types of mapping rules. The first one is the mapping between the historical wind power and the historical price. The second is the forecasting rule for wind generation. Based on the two rules, we forecast the price via the forecasted generation and the first learned mapping between power and price. Additionally, we observed that it is not the more training data the better, leading to our validation steps to quantify the best training intervals for different datasets. We conduct comparisons of numerical results between existing methods and the proposed methods based on datasets from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). For each machine learning step, we examine different learning methods, such as polynomial regression, support vector regression, neural network, and deep neural network. The results show that the proposed method is significantly better than existing approaches when renewables are involved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price forecast; Machine learning methods; Renewables; Wind power generation,Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Forecasting; Mapping; Neural networks; Numerical methods; Polynomial regression; Power markets; Supervised learning; Support vector regression; Tunneling (excavation); Wind power; Electric reliability council of texas; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting methods; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Renewables; Supervised learning approaches; Learning systems; alternative energy; artificial neural network; electricity industry; energy planning; forecasting method; historical perspective; numerical method; price determination; supervised learning; wind power; Texas; United States,Article
"de Marcos R.A., Bello A., Reneses J.",Electricity price forecasting in the short term hybridising fundamental and econometric modelling,2019,10.0,"Traders and practitioners in diverse power exchanges are nowadays being most exposed to uncertainty than ever. The combination of several factors such as renewable generation and regulatory changes calls for suitable electricity price forecasting models that can deal with complex and unusual market conditions. Several authors have proposed combining fundamental approaches with econometric models in order to cover all relevant aspects for electricity price forecasting. This combination has shown positive results for medium-term horizons. However, this approach has rarely been carried out for short-term applications. Moreover, several day-to-day applications in electricity markets require fast responsiveness and accurate forecasts. All of these facts encourage this work's short-term hybrid electricity price forecasting model, which combines a cost-production optimisation (fundamental) model with an artificial neural network (econometric) model. In order to validate the advantages and contributions of the proposed model, it has been applied to a real-size power exchange with complex price dynamics, such as the Iberian electricity market. Moreover, its forecasting performance has been compared with those of the two individual components of the hybrid model as well as other well-recognised methods. The results of this comparison prove that the proposed forecasting model outperforms the benchmark models, especially in uncommon market circumstances. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Econometric models; Electricity markets; Fundamental models; Hybrid models; Short-term forecasting,Commerce; Complex networks; Forecasting; Neural networks; Econometric model; Econometric modelling; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting performance; Fundamental models; Hybrid model; Iberian electricity market; Short-term forecasting; Power markets,Article

"Figueiredo N.C., Da Silva P.P.",The price of wind power generation in Iberia and the merit-order effect,2018,10.0,"Renewable energy generation depresses electricity spot prices, which is often used as argument to justify incentives provided to renewables. In the so-called “merit-order effect”, renewable power reduces the load available for conventional power and displaces higher marginal cost generation out of the market. In this study, we estimate the value of the “merit-order effect” due to wind power generation in the Iberian market, in the period between 1st January 2008 and 31st October 2016. This value, representing consumers’ potential cost savings, is compared with the direct costs of the financial incentives in Portugal and in Spain. The accumulated “merit-order effect” amount is estimated to be 26.1 billion €, whilst the total values for the financial incentives reported is 23.9 billion €. The value of the “merit-order effect” explains the existing lower returns by conventional generation and might have additional impacts on future RES projects, subject to normal electricity market risks. © 2018, Aalborg University press.

"Uniejewski B., Weron R.",Efficient forecasting of electricity spot prices with expert and LASSO models,2018,10.0,"Recent electricity price forecasting (EPF) studies suggest that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) leads to well performing models that are generally better than those obtained from other variable selection schemes. By conducting an empirical study involving datasets from two major power markets (Nord Pool and PJM Interconnection), three expert models, two multi-parameter regression (called baseline) models and four variance stabilizing transformations combined with the seasonal component approach, we discuss the optimal way of implementing the LASSO. We show that using a complex baseline model with nearly 400 explanatory variables, a well chosen variance stabilizing transformation (asinh or N-PIT), and a procedure that recalibrates the LASSO regularization parameter once or twice a day indeed leads to significant accuracy gains compared to the typically considered EPF models. Moreover, by analyzing the structures of the best LASSO-estimated models, we identify the most important explanatory variables and thus provide guidelines to structuring better performing models. © 2018 MDPI AG.

"Pircalabu A., Benth F.E.",A regime-switching copula approach to modeling day-ahead prices in coupled electricity markets,2017,10.0,"The recent price coupling of many European electricity markets has triggered a fundamental change in the interaction of day-ahead prices, challenging additionally the modeling of the joint behavior of prices in interconnected markets. In this paper we propose a regime-switching AR–GARCH copula to model pairs of day-ahead electricity prices in coupled European markets. While capturing key stylized facts empirically substantiated in the literature, this model easily allows us to 1) deviate from the assumption of normal margins and 2) include a more detailed description of the dependence between prices. We base our empirical study on four pairs of prices, namely Germany–France, Germany–Netherlands, Netherlands–Belgium and Germany–Western Denmark. We find that the marginal dynamics are better described by the flexible skew t distribution than the benchmark normal distribution. Also, we find significant evidence of tail dependence in all pairs of interconnected areas we consider. As a first application of the proposed model, we consider the pricing of financial transmission rights, and highlight how the choice of marginal distributions and copula impacts prices. As a second application we consider the forecasting of tail quantiles, and evaluate the out-of-sample performance of competing models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Copula models; Day-ahead electricity prices; Financial transmission rights; Market coupling; Tail dependence; Tail quantile forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Normal distribution; Copula models; Electricity prices; Financial transmission right; Market coupling; Tail dependence; Power markets; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; modeling; performance assessment; price dynamics; Belgium; Denmark; France; Germany; Netherlands,Article
"Simshauser P., Whish-Wilson P.",Price discrimination in Australia's retail electricity markets: An analysis of Victoria & Southeast Queensland,2017,10.0,"When capital-intensive monopoly industries are restructured and deregulated, consumer prices commence a natural drift from regulated uniform ‘average cost’ tariffs to competitive differential prices, and this can raise problems for policymakers. Deep discounts are welcomed, high Standing Offers are not. But price discrimination is unremarkable in economics. Indeed, in industries where fixed & sunk costs represent a significant portion of total cost, discriminatory pricing is usually welfare enhancing. Conversely, theory predicts and empirical evidence confirms that regulatory efforts to cherry-pick differential prices in asymmetric markets will damage consumer welfare. In this article, we analyse differential retail electricity offer prices in the Australian States of Victoria and Queensland and contrast these with industry average total cost and the marginal cost of retail supply. We find deregulated Victoria displays high price dispersion with Standing Offer tariffs 10% above industry average total cost and marginal offers at break-even prices (i.e. 20% below average total cost). In the semi-regulated Southeast Queensland market where a regulated price-cap exists, there is lower dispersion but marginal offers include a 6.7% retail mark-up. Efficient pricing requires the marginal unit produced to be priced at marginal cost and Victoria meets this criteria – but we identify an episode of inter-consumer misallocation due to high Standing Offers. We conclude policy initiatives designed to help firms shift vulnerable households from Standing Offer tariffs is desirable. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity tariffs; Non-linear prices; Price discrimination,Commerce; Dispersions; Economics; Power markets; Sales; Break-even prices; Consumer welfares; Discriminatory pricing; Electricity tariff; Non linear; Policy initiatives; Price discrimination; Retail electricity markets; Costs; capital; electricity supply; energy market; monopoly; price dynamics; retailing; tariff structure; Australia; Queensland; Victoria [Australia],Article

"Figueiredo N.C., Silva P.P.D., Bunn D.",Weather and market specificities in the regional transmission of renewable energy price effects,2016,10.0,"This study is motivated by the observation that the effects of renewable energy output variations across several integrated power markets are likely to be complicated by price arbitrage and weather dynamics. Wind in particular has supply side effects when associated with substantial generating facilities, but also demand side influences when associated with extreme weather conditions. To unravel these effects, daily electricity prices and the weather variables wind, temperature and their interaction (wind chill) in the Central-West Europe coupled market were analysed from 2007 to the end of 2014 by means of vector autoregressions. The spillover effects were found to be quite subtle. Despite efficient price arbitrage, it is not the case that daily wind output shocks diffuse uniformly across all markets, or that the largest generator of wind energy creates the most significant spillovers or that high wind conditions necessarily lead to lower prices. Market specificities matter and are important for operational prediction and weather risk hedging. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity; Market integration; Prices; Weather; Wind energy,Costs; Electricity; Financial markets; Regression analysis; Weathering; Wind power; Electricity prices; Extreme weather conditions; Market integration; Operational predictions; Prices; Renewable energies; Spillover effects; Vector autoregressions; Commerce; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity supply; price dynamics; renewable resource; spillover effect; temperature; vector autoregression; weather; wind power; Europe,Article
Melichar M.,Energy price shocks and economic activity: Which energy price series should we be using?,2016,10.0,"There is not one primary energy market and the price of oil is not a good proxy for many alternative energy prices. Therefore, this paper explores the effects of alternative energy price shocks on economic activity, and examines the relative performance of these alternative measures in predicting state level economic activity using the Davidson and MacKinnon J-test. The alternative energy price series considered are as follows: gasoline, diesel, natural gas, heating oil, and electricity. Alternative measures of energy price shocks produce different patterns of impulse responses than oil price shocks. Additionally, overwhelming evidence indicates that alternative energy price models, excluding models containing the price of gasoline, outperform the baseline model containing the price of oil for many states, particularly at short-to-mid forecast horizons.

"Wang K., Xu C., Guo S.",Big data analytics for price forecasting in smart grids,2016,10.0,"Demand side management (DSM) is a key mechanism to make smart grids cost efficient using electricity price forecasting issue. Price forecasting method takes the big price data into account, and gives estimates of the future electricity price. However, most of existing price forecasting methods cannot avoid redundancy at feature selection and lack of an integrated framework that coordinates the steps in forecasting. To address this issue, we first propose a new electricity price forecasting framework. It is significant to design a system tool chain based on big data analytics for ensuring that the users can make appropriate decisions. To this end, three algorithms are proposed integratedly. First, feature redundancy elimination is implemented by the fusion of Grey Correlation Analysis (GCA) and ReliefF algorithm. Second, a combination of Kernel function and Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) is designed to achieve dimensionality reduction. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization algorithm based on differential evolution (DE) is proposed to forecast price classification. These three modules jointly power the price forecasting system.

"Jiang P., Liu F., Song Y.","A hybrid multi-step model for forecasting day-ahead electricity price based on optimization, fuzzy logic and model selection",2016,10.0,"The day-ahead electricity market is closely related to other commodity markets such as the fuel and emission markets and is increasingly playing a significant role in human life. Thus, in the electricity markets, accurate electricity price forecasting plays significant role for power producers and consumers. Although many studies developing and proposing highly accurate forecasting models exist in the literature, there have been few investigations on improving the forecasting effectiveness of electricity price from the perspective of reducing the volatility of data with satisfactory accuracy. Based on reducing the volatility of the electricity price and the forecasting nature of the radial basis function network (RBFN), this paper successfully develops a two-stage model to forecast the day-ahead electricity price, of which the first stage is particle swarm optimization (PSO)-core mapping (CM) with self-organizing-map and fuzzy set (PCMwSF), and the second stage is selection rule (SR). The PCMwSF stage applies CM, fuzzy set and optimized weights to obtain the future price, and the SR stage is inspired by the forecasting nature of RBFN and effectively selects the best forecast during the test period. The proposed model, i.e., CM-PCMwSF-SR, not only overcomes the difficulty of reducing the high volatility of the electricity price but also leads to a superior forecasting effectiveness than benchmarks. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reducing volatility; Selection rule (SR); Self-organizing-map,Commerce; Computer circuits; Conformal mapping; Costs; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; Self organizing maps; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting models; Highly accurate; Radial basis function Networks (RBFN); Reducing volatility; Selection Rules; Power markets,Article

However, while spot and future markets are currently rather liquid, option trading is still limited. One of the potential reasons for this is that the electricity spot price process remains a puzzle to researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we propose an approach to model electricity spot prices that combines mean reversion, spikes, negative prices, and stochastic volatility. Thereby, we use different mean reversion rates for ‘normal’ and ‘extreme’ (spike) periods. Furthermore, all model parameters can easily be estimated using historical data. Consequently, we argue that this model does not only extend the academic literature on electricity spot price modeling, but is also suitable for practical purposes, such as an underlying price model for option pricing. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",electricity; Lévy processes; mean reversion; spikes; stochastic volatility,,Article

Intra-day power prices have a fine structure and are driven by an interaction of fundamental, behavioural and stochastic factors. Furthermore, there are reasons to expect the functional forms of price formation to be nonlinear in these factors and therefore specifying forecasting models that perform well out-of-sample is methodologically challenging. Markov regime switching has been widely advocated to capture some aspects of the nonlinearity, but it may suffer from overfitting and unobservability in the underlying states.

"Nieuwenhout F., Brand A.",The impact of wind power on day-ahead electricity prices in the Netherlands,2011,10.0,"A detailed analysis was conducted to assess to what extent availability of wind energy has influenced day-ahead electricity prices in the Netherlands over the past four years. With a meteorological model, time series of day-ahead wind forecasts were generated for the period 2006-2009, and these were compared with APX-ENDEX day-ahead market prices. Wind energy contributes to only 4% of electricity generation in the Netherlands, but was found to depress average day-ahead market prices by about 5%. With the help of the bid curves on the APX-ENDEX day-ahead market for 2009, a model was made to assess the impact of increasing levels of wind generation on power prices in the Netherlands. One of the main findings is that the future impact on prices will be less than in the past. With an increase of installed wind capacity from 2200 MW to 6000 MW, average day-ahead prices are expected to be depressed by an additional 6% in case no additional conventional generation is assumed. Taking into account existing government policy on wind and ongoing work on new conventional power plants, prices in 2016 will be only 3% lower due to wind. © 2011 IEEE.",,Bid curve; Conventional generation; Conventional power plants; Day ahead market; Day-ahead prices; Electricity generation; Electricity prices; Meteorological models; Netherlands; Power price; Wind capacity; Wind forecasts; Wind generation; Commerce; Electric generators; Electricity; Time series; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Costs,Conference Paper

"Filho J.C.R., Affonso C.M., Oliveira R.C.L.",Pricing analysis in the Brazilian energy market: A decision tree approach,2009,10.0,"There is a general consensus that electricity price forecasting is an important task nowadays since power market players are interested in the maximization of profit and the minimization of risk. In this context, this paper proposes the use of Data-Mining techniques to predict the short-term electricity price in the Brazilian market. In Brazil, the market model adopted has unique characteristics with a centralized form of dispatch due to the predominance of hydro generation. To apply the proposed prediction model, all features of the Brazilian electricity market are considered, such as the transmission restrictions among geo-electrical regions and the price dependency with storage energy in reservoirs. In the proposed prediction model, the electricity price is the dependent variable and the monthly time series data sets from the Brazilian system (such as power load, stored energy and thermal generation) are the independent variables. First, clustering of the data samples is performed to group similar behavior of the attributes. After that, a decision tree algorithm is applied to extract if-then rules from database. The rules obtained allow the identification of attributes that most influence the short-term electricity price. Results show that the proposed model can be an attractive tool to all electricity market players to forecast the short-term electricity price and mitigate the risks in purchasing power. © 2009 IEEE.",Clustering; Data-mining; Decision trees; Short-term electricity price forecasting,Brazilian electricity markets; Brazilian system; Clustering; Clustering data; Data sample; Decision-tree algorithm; Dependent variables; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Energy markets; Hydro generation; If-then rules; Independent variables; Market model; Power load; Power markets; Prediction model; Purchasing power; Storage energy; Stored energy; Thermal generation; Time-series data; Cluster analysis; Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Mathematical models; Profitability; Time series; Electric generators,Conference Paper
"Galetovic A., Muñoz C.M.",Estimating deficit probabilities with price-responsive demand in contract-based electricity markets,2009,10.0,"Studies that estimate deficit probabilities in hydrothermal systems have generally ignored the response of demand to changing prices, in the belief that such response is largely irrelevant. We show that ignoring the response of demand to prices can lead to substantial over or under estimation of the probability of an energy deficit. To make our point we present an estimation of deficit probabilities in Chile's Central Interconnected System between 2006 and 2010.

"Theodorou P., Karyampas D.",Modeling the return and volatility of the Greek electricity marginal system price,2008,10.0,"Traditional cost based optimization models (WASP) for expansion planning do not allow for mark-to-market valuation and cannot satisfy arbitrage free requirements. This work will fill this gap by developing and estimating models for mark-to-market valuation. Furthermore the present paper examines the return and volatility of the newly born Greek's electricity market's marginal system price. A detailed description of the market mechanism and regulation is used to describe how prices are determined in order to proceed with return and volatility modeling. Continuous time mean reverting and time varying mean reverting stochastic processes have been solved in discrete time processes and estimated econometrically along with ARMAX and GARCH models. It was found that GARCH model gave much better estimation and forecasting ability. Strong persistence in mean has been found giving suspicions of market inefficiency and strong incentives for arbitrage opportunities. Finally, the change in the regulatory framework has been controlled and found to have significant impact. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Zheng H., Xie L., Zhang L.-Z.",Electricity price forecasting based on GARCH model in deregulated market,2005,10.0,"Since electricity market came into being, it has been generalized in many countries. In the research field of electricity market, electricity price has been one of the focused problems, which has great influence on the market. And then electricity price forecasting as a basic information tool to analyze the near future market, becomes more important than before. However, in such a competitive environment, the changes of electricity price are so volatile, even price spikes happened. So electricity price forecasting becomes more difficult. To solve above problem, we build a novel model to forecast electricity price based on GARCH (that is generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity), which fits for volatility modeling. First, electricity price is regarded as finance time series and analyze its volatility, which explains the presence of heteroskedasticity. Then price forecasting is proposed with GARCH model, which aims at modeling the dynamic character of price. Case studies testify the validity of the proposed model.",Electricity price; Forecast; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Heteroskedasticity; Volatility,Electric industry; Forecasting; Industrial economics; Mathematical models; Time series analysis; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH); Price spikes; Volatility; Electric rates,Conference Paper
"Skantze P., Ilic M., Gubina A.",Modelling locational price spreads in competitive electricity markets; applications for transmission rights valuation and replication,2004,10.0,"The restructuring of the electric utilities industry has forced industry participants to rethink their approach to a number of decision processes. To manage risk and plan investment in generation assets, as well as to examine the efficient expansion of the current transmission grid, one needs to have a clear understanding of the interaction between the grid properties and the behaviour of the regional power markets. In this paper we discuss a fundamental modelling approach which extracts the stochastic properties of electricity prices by modelling the impact of physical and economic drivers affecting the production, delivery, and consumption of electricity. If the fundamental inputs are directly observable, we can use historical data to calibrate the model parameters. In the case of electricity, this simple and abundant set of training data can make a crucial difference. We present the bid-based stochastic model (BSM) and look into its application to valuing of financial derivatives, especially options based on the locational spread in electricity price between two markets. The advantage of the bid-based model is that one is able to link the capacity of the transmission line, in megawatts, directly to the correlation between electricity prices at the end nodes. This leads us to a valuation method for a locational spread option, the financial equivalent of a physical transmission right. The model represents an improvement over standard spread option formulation in that it accounts for the effect of the nonlinear flows in the transmission network on the correlation and distribution of locational prices. We also address the question of whether financial transmission rights can be replicated with a dynamic portfolio of forward contracts at the end nodes. This poses the possibility of model-based arbitrage between existing forward markets and the emerging transmission rights markets. Furthermore, it allows users to simulate the effect of transmission outages or expansion. For example, a for-profit transmission provider who is contemplating addition of a new transmission line between two markets needs to know whether he will be able to recover the fixed cost of investing in the line by selling transmission rights to market participants. By calibrating the bid-based model according to current price levels and adding the capacity of the new transmission line, the transmission owner can simulate future cash flows and estimate the profitability of the investment.",,,Article
"Zhang J., Tan Z., Wei Y.",An adaptive hybrid model for short term electricity price forecasting,2020,9.0,"With the large-scale renewable energy integration into the power grid, the features of electricity price has become more complex, which makes the existing models hard to obtain a satisfactory results. Hence, more accurate and stable forecasting models need to be developed. In this paper, a new adaptive hybrid model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and deep belief network (DBN) is proposed for short term electricity price forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by using data from Australian, Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) and Spanish electricity markets.

"Taghizadeh-Hesary F., Yoshino N., Inagaki Y.",Empirical analysis of factors influencing the price of solar modules,2019,9.0,"Purpose: One of the key drivers behind the recent growth in the global solar energy market is the decline in solar module prices. Many empirical analyses have been carried out to identify the mechanism behind this price reduction. However, studies on the price reduction mechanism of solar modules over the years have focused purely on the technological aspect of manufacturing. The purpose of this study is to consider the influence of economic and monetary factors such as the interest rate and exchange rate on solar module pricing in addition to other factors that considered in earlier studies including technology, wage rate and other energy prices. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, an oligopolistic model and econometric method are used to determine the economic factors that have an influence on solar module prices. The paper constructs a solar module pricing model and conducts a fully modified ordinary least squares analysis to estimate the influence of each factor. Analysis is conducted for the top five solar module producing countries in the world from 1997 to 2015. The five countries are the People’s Republic of China, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the USA. Findings: Empirical analysis provides several findings concerning the solar module pricing mechanism. These vary for each country. However, generally the interest rate has a positive correlation with solar module prices, while the exchange rate, knowledge stock and oil price have a negative correlation with solar module prices. Practical implications: First, the government must expand channels for renewable energy funding. As renewable industries are high-tech, the influence that capital cost has on technology price is significant. Government efforts to provide industries with low-interest finance will accelerate renewable business. There have been many attempts to lower interest rates for renewable energy technology to accelerate growth in the green technology market. Second, the government must expand research and development (R&D) expenditures focused on renewable energy technology. The technological advancements acquired through R&D enhance module performance efficiency, thereby reducing costs. Therefore, government policies aimed at increasing targeted R&D expenditure will be an effective means of expanding the installation of renewable energies. Originality/value: Studies on the price reduction mechanism of solar modules over the years have focused purely on the technological aspect of the manufacturing.

"Vilar J., Aneiros G., Raña P.",Prediction intervals for electricity demand and price using functional data,2018,9.0,"This paper provides two procedures to obtain prediction intervals for electricity demand and price based on functional data. The proposed procedures are related to one day ahead pointwise forecast. In particular, the first method uses a nonparametric autoregressive model and the second one uses a partial linear semi-parametric model, in which exogenous scalar covariates are incorporated in a linear way. In both cases, the proposed procedures for the construction of the prediction intervals use residual-based bootstrap algorithms, which allows also to obtain estimates of the prediction density. Applications to the Spanish Electricity Market, in year 2012, are reported. This work extends and complements the results of Aneiros et al.

Explanatory variables used alternatively in the price equation and in the switching equation include power demand, the supply of intermittent renewables, the residual supply index, and a congestion indicator. Four competing hypotheses on the determinants of price regimes are tested (arbitrary market power, cost profile, tacit collusion, congestion) in order to understand why, despite the general trend of declining prices induced by renewables in southern Italy, Sicilian prices stood high. The pattern of estimated coefficients is consistent with a tacit collusion story. © 2016.",Electricity price; Energy island; Markov regime-switching; Price regimes; Tacit collusion,Economics; Energy resources; Electricity prices; Energy island; Markov regime-switching; Price regimes; Tacit collusion; Costs; demand analysis; electricity supply; energy market; price determination; probability; Italy; Sicily,Article
"Lai P., Du M., Wang B., Chen Z.",Assessment and decomposition of total factor energy efficiency: An evidence based on energy shadow price in China,2016,9.0,"By adopting an energy-input based directional distance function, we calculated the shadow price of four types of energy (i.e., coal, oil, gas and electricity) among 30 areas in China from 1998 to 2012. Moreover, a macro-energy efficiency index in China was estimated and divided into intra-provincial technical efficiency, allocation efficiency of energy input structure and inter-provincial energy allocation efficiency. It shows that total energy efficiency has decreased in recent years, where intra-provincial energy technical efficiency drops markedly and extensive mode of energy consumption rises. However, energy structure and allocation improves slowly. Meanwhile, lacking an integrated energy market leads to the loss of energy efficiency. Further improvement of market allocation and structure adjustment play a pivotal role in the increase of energy efficiency. © 2016 by the authors.",Directional distance function; Efficiency decomposition; Energy efficiency; Shadow price,assessment method; decomposition analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy use; shadow pricing; spatiotemporal analysis; China,Article
"Bigerna S., Bollino C.A.",Ramsey prices in the Italian electricity market,2016,9.0,"In this paper,we derive optimal zonal prices in the Italian day-ahead electricity market using estimation of a complete system of hourly demand in 2010-2011.In Italy, the hourly equilibrium price for all buyers is computed as a uniform average of supply zonal prices,resulting from market splitting due to line congestion. We model exante individual bids expressed by heterogeneous consumers, which are distinguished by geographical zones. Using empirical estimations,we compute demand elasticity values and new zonal prices, according to a Ramsey optimal scheme. This is a new approach in the wholesale electricity market literature, as previous studies have discussed the relative merit of zonal prices, considering only the issue of line congestion. Our results show that the optimal pricing scheme can improve welfare in the day-ahead Italian electricity market, with respect to both the existing uniform price scheme and the proposal to charge the existing supply zonal prices to the demand side. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Demand elasticity; Electricity markets; Heterogeneous consumers'behavior; Optimal ramsey prices; Zonal prices,Commerce; Consumer behavior; Elasticity; Electric industry; Power markets; Demand elasticities; Electricity market; Heterogeneous consumers' behavior; Ramsey prices; Zonal prices; Costs; consumption behavior; demand elasticity; demand-side management; electricity; energy market; price dynamics; Italy,Article
"Uritskaya O.Y., Uritsky V.M.",Predictability of price movements in deregulated electricity markets,2015,9.0,"In this paper we investigate predictability of electricity prices in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Ontario, as well as in the US Mid-C market. Using scale-dependent detrended fluctuation analysis, spectral analysis, and the probability distribution analysis we show that the studied markets exhibit strongly anti-persistent properties suggesting that their dynamics can be predicted based on historic price records across the range of time scales from 1. h to one month. For both Canadian markets, the price movements reveal three types of correlated behavior which can be used for forecasting. The discovered scenarios remain the same on different time scales up to one month as well as for on- and off-peak electricity data. These scenarios represent sharp increases of prices and are not present in the Mid-C market due to its lower volatility. We argue that extreme price movements in this market should follow the same tendency as the more volatile Canadian markets. The estimated values of the Pareto indices suggest that the prediction of these events can be statistically stable.

"Carpio J., Juan J., López D.",Multivariate exponential smoothing and dynamic factor model applied to hourly electricity price analysis,2014,9.0,"Thanks to its very simple recursive computing scheme, exponential smoothing has become a popular technique to forecast time series. In this work, we show the advantages of its multivariate version and present some properties of the model, which allows us to perform a dynamic factor analysis. This analysis leads to a simple methodology to reduce the number of parameters (useful when the dimension of observations is large) via a linear transformation that decomposes the multivariate process into independent univariate exponential smoothing processes, characterized by a single smoothing parameter that goes from zero (white-noise process) to one (random walk process). A computer implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm has been built for the maximum likelihood estimation of the models. The practicality of the method is demonstrated by its application to hourly electricity price predictions in some day-ahead markets, such as Omel, Powernext, and Nord Pool markets, whose forecasts are given as examples.

"Samitas A., Armenatzoglou A.",Regression tree model versus Markov regime switching: a comparison for electricity spot price modelling and forecasting,2014,9.0,"This paper models electricity spot prices using a Markov regime switching (MRS) model and regression trees (RT). MRS models offer the possibility to divide the time series into different regimes with different underlying processes. RT is a data driven technique aiming in finding a classifier that performs an average guessing for the response variable in question, which is the short term electricity spot price. We use a dataset consisting of average day ahead spot electricity prices for the MRS model. Then, we use hourly data to build the RT model. The empirical evidence supports that the regression tree approach outperforms the MRS model. We also compare the forecasting accuracy of the regression tree model by incorporating different predictors sets for electricity prices and logarithmic electricity prices. We find that a model with 11 predictors, accounting for logarithmic prices fits best our data. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Electricity prices; Energy markets; Forecast performance; Non parametric; Parametric,,Review

Here, we propose a new goodness-of-fit testing scheme for the marginal distribution of such models. We consider models with an observable (like threshold autoregressions) as well as a latent state process (like Markov regime-switching). The test is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov supremum-distance statistic and the concept of the weighted empirical distribution function. The motivation for this research comes from a recent stream of literature in energy economics concerning electricity spot price models. While the existence of distinct regimes in such data is generally unquestionable (due to the supply stack structure), the actual goodness-of-fit of the models requires statistical validation. We illustrate the proposed scheme by testing whether commonly used Markov regime-switching models fit deseasonalized electricity prices from the NEPOOL (US) day-ahead market. © 2012 The Author(s).",Energy economics; Goodness-of-fit; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Regime-switching; Weighted empirical distribution function,,Article

"Shrestha G.B., Songbo Q.",Analysis of electricity price in competitive markets a study in Singapore market,2008,9.0,"Market participants have to deal with constantly changing electricity price in competitive electricity markets in the course of their everyday system operation. Although these prices in a particular market do exhibit some characteristics they are stochastic in nature and the prices cannot be predicted or forecasted for an individual hour. Yet, reasonable predictions or representations of such prices are very crucial for the operations of many market participants, such as Gencos. Many studies have adopted suitable statistical representation of the price in order to carry out system operation problems. However, justification for such models on the basis of real market prices is rarely found. This paper presents the initial findings of the study conducted to characterize the statistical behavior of electricity price in competitive markets. The published electricity prices from Singapore market have been used in these studies. The preliminary analysis is carried out using the price data from the first three years after the introduction deregulation in the market. It is used to identify the general behavior of the mean values of electricity price which show that it is possible to establish reasonable relationship between the market price and many system related factors. Recent historical data from the same market are used to investigate the statistical nature of the electricity price. Several statistical distribution functions are identified through the analyses of the historical price data which are likely to represent the stochastic nature of the electricity price. Graphical and statistical analyses are used for this purpose. Statistical analysis and testing have indicated that the behavior of the market price may resemble log-normal distribution. Further refinements in the representation of the market price are being studied. © 2008 IEEE.",Competitive electricity market; Electricity price; Log-normal; Statistical distribution - normal; Statistical tests; Weibull distributions,Deregulation; Distribution functions; Electric load forecasting; Energy conversion; Forecasting; Marketing; Normal distribution; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Quality assurance; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Statistical methods; Statistics; Stochastic programming; 21st century; Competitive electricity market; Competitive electricity markets; Competitive markets; Electrical energy; Electricity price; Electricity pricing; Historical data; Log-normal; Log-normal distributions; Market participants; Market pricing; Mean values; Preliminary analysis; Singapore; Statistical analysis; Statistical behaviors; Statistical distribution - normal; Statistical distribution functions; Statistical tests; Stochastic nature; System operations; Weibull distributions; Electric network analysis,Conference Paper
"Wang Y., Yu S.",Price forecasting by ICA-SVM in the competitive electricity market,2008,9.0,"Price forecaster is one of the important aspects in the researches of the electricity price. But because of the special properties of electricity, the price of electricity is far more volatile than that of other relatively volatile commodities. Due to such significant volatility, it is difficult to make an accurate forecast for the spot market of electricity. To solve above problem, a hybrid algorithm for price forecasting is proposed. The procedure comprises two main steps. The first step is feature extract of price feature by independent component analysis that has special effect on extracting the latent source feature. The second step is regression modeling by support vector machine training with the refined features that can realize higher-dimensional nonlinear regression with good generalization ability. In this way, the two algorithms have combined, whose advantages have been made a full use.

"Mandal P., Senjyu T., Yona A., Park J.-W., Srivastava A.K.",Sensitivity analysis of similar days parameters for predicting short-term electricity price,2007,9.0,"This paper describes an identification of the best similar days parameters for artificial neural network (ANN) based short-term price forecasting. The work presented in this paper is an extended version of our previous works where we proposed the price prediction technique by using ANN, which is based on similar days method. According to similar days method, we select similar price days corresponding to forecast day based on Euclidean norm. The focus of the present paper is mainly on sensitivity analysis of similar days parameter while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the PJM electricity market. We simulated three cases by: (i) selecting two similar days parameters (load at t and price at t); (ii) selecting three similar days parameters (load at t, price at t and price at t - 1), and (iii) selecting five similar days parameters (load at t, load at t - 1, load at t + 1, price at t and price at t - 1). The next-24h price forecasts obtained from ANN based on similar days method confirm that the performance of the ANN model is better when five similar days parameters are selected, i.e., the accuracy of the method is enhanced by the addition of load at t - 1 and t + 1. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, and historical price factors are well discussed. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of reasonably small values were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination of (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. © 2007 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Electricity price forecasting; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Power market; Similar days,Backpropagation; Correlation methods; Error analysis; Forecasting; Neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; ANN modeling; Artificial neural network; Correlation co-efficient; Electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity pricing; Euclidean norms; Load factors; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Mean absolute percentage error; Mean-square errors; Power market; Price factors; Price forecasting; Price prediction; Similar days; Time factors; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper

In the traditional and also new structure of the power industry, accurate short and long term load forecasting have been crucial to the efficient and economic operation of the system. However in the environment of a deregulated power market, various decisions require accurate knowledge of future spot prices for electricity. To buy or sell physical electricity, to offer a transaction to the market, or to analyze security of the network are examples of transactions that can rationally be made only with an idea of future electricity prices. Therefore, forecasting of the Market Clearing Price (MCP) is becoming increasingly relevant to different market players and system operator. This paper introduces a new forecasting method that forecasts the next-day electricity price and the electricity load based on Cooperative Co-evolutionary (Co-Co) approach. The proposed method is applied to predict the MCP and the load in a real power market. The results of the new method show significant improvement in the load and price forecasting process. © 2006 IEEE.",Artificial neural networks; Cooperative co-evolutionary; Deregulation; Electric power markets; Load forecasting; Price forecasting,Decision making; Electric industry; Electric loads; Forecasting; Marketing; Neural networks; Electric power markets; Load forecasting; Market Clearing Price (MCP); Price forecasting; Industrial economics,Conference Paper
"Li Y., Flynn P.C.",Power Price in Deregulated Markets,2003,9.0,"We compare the diurnal pattern of power price for weekdays and weekends for 14 deregulated markets, and find significant differences. All markets show low early morning prices with one or more price peaks during the day and evening. North American markets show a weekday monotonic pattern; European and New Zealand markets show a ""double peak"" pattern. Markets differ in the ratio of daily maximum to minimum price and of average weekday to average weekend price, and hence have a different incentive for time shifting power consuming activities within and between days. Data were filtered to remove days of high or low price excursions. In some but not all markets both the average price and the diurnal price pattern change significantly; infrequent price excursions shape price patterns. Price shows a significant correlation to load in some but not all markets. Some deregulated markets have patterns that are consistent and predictable and encourage a customer to shape power consuming activities, while other markets show a far lower degree of consistency, and create a high incentive to hedge.",Deregulated Electricity Market; Diurnal Power Price Patterns; Power Prices,Crude petroleum; Electric power systems; Electric power utilization; Electric rates; Energy utilization; Fuel economy; Marketing; Natural gas; Deregulated electricity market; Diurnal power price patterns; Power prices; Electric utilities,Conference Paper
"Zhang L., Luh P.B.",An integrated neural network method for market clearing price prediction and confidence interval estimation,2002,9.0,"Market energy clearing prices (MCPs) play an important role in a deregulated power market, and good MCP prediction and interval estimation will help utilities and independent power producers submit effective bids with low risks. MCP is a non-stationary process, and an adaptive algorithm with fast convergence is important. A common method for MCP prediction is neural networks, and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) can be used as an integrated adaptive learning and interval estimation method, with fast convergence and small confidence interval. However, the EKF learning is computationally expensive because it involves high dimensional matrices. This paper presents a modified U-D factorization method within the framework of decoupled EKF. The computation speed is significantly improved and also is the numerical stability. EKF learning can then be used for high dimensional practical problems. Testing results show that the integrated learning and confidence interval algorithm provides better prediction than the back propagation algorithm and the confidence interval is smaller than that of a Bayesian inference-based interval estimation method.",Confidence interval; Extended Kalman filter; Market energy clearing price; Neural networks; Power systems; Prediction,Adaptive algorithms; Asymptotic stability; Backpropagation; Computational methods; Convergence of numerical methods; Cost accounting; Deregulation; Electric industry; Estimation; Kalman filtering; Confidence Interval Estimation; Extended Kalman filter; Independent power producer; Integrated adaptive learning; Market Clearing Price Prediction; Neural networks,Conference Paper
"Liu H., Wang X., Zhang W., Xu G.",Market clearing price forecasting based on dynamic fuzzy system,2002,9.0,"The problem of forecasting power market clearing price is addressed based on dynamic fuzzy system (DFS). Dynamic fuzzy system is a modified model of fuzzy system. It separates the rule reasoning layer into two layers: antecedent layer and consequence layer. DFS can learn rules by itself from sample data rapidly. As all sample data were input into DFS completely, the rule set of DFS are established automatically. Therefore, DFS performs well in dynamic condition. In addition, hybrid-and-length-varied-encoding genetic algorithms (GAs) is used to train the DFS. New crossover operator and mutation operator for this scheme are presented. The whole model, not only the membership function parameters, but also the fuzzy quantities numbers of input and output variables are adjusted automatically based on sample data. The problem of forecasting market clearing price (MCP) in power market is very important and very complicated. In this paper, DFS is used to solve this problem. With the consideration of California Power Market MCP data, the test results shows that DFS performs very well in this varied condition. © 2002 IEEE.",Dynamic Fuzzy System; Finding Fuzzy Rule; Genetic Algorithms; Market Clearing Price; Power Market,Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Membership functions; Power markets; Problem solving; Crossover operator; Dynamic condition; Dynamic fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithm (GAs); Input and outputs; Market Clearing Price; Market clearing prices; Mutation operators; Fuzzy inference,Conference Paper

The model combines features of both reliability pricing and real-time pricing. A production cost simulation submodel is used to estimate expected total and marginal production costs on an hourly basis, as well as system reliability measured by the loss-of-load probability. These estimates are inputs to a welfare-maximization model with revenue constraints differentiated by customer class. The methodology is illustrated by a numerical application with typical power system and market data. The results show that the proposed pricing approach is significantly superior to spot and Ramsey pricing in terms of economic efficiency, energy conservation, and generation-capacity requirements.

"Oksuz I., Ugurlu U.",Neural network based model comparison for intraday electricity price forecasting,2019,8.0,"The intraday electricity markets are continuous trade platforms for each hour of the day and have specific characteristics. These markets have shown an increasing number of transactions due to the requirement of close to delivery electricity trade. Recently, intraday electricity price market research has seen a rapid increase in a number of works for price prediction. However, most of these works focus on the features and descriptive statistics of the intraday electricity markets and overlook the comparison of different available models. In this paper, we compare a variety of methods including neural networks to predict intraday electricity market prices in Turkish intraday market. The recurrent neural networks methods outperform the classical methods. Furthermore, gated recurrent unit network architecture achieves the best results with a mean absolute error of 0.978 and a root mean square error of 1.302.

"Goodarzi S., Perera H.N., Bunn D.",The impact of renewable energy forecast errors on imbalance volumes and electricity spot prices,2019,8.0,"This paper contributes to the general consideration of whether a policy of incentivising system operators to improve the quality and market availability of forecasts for renewable energy outputs would be beneficial. Using data from the German electricity market, we investigate the effect of wind and solar energy forecasts errors on imbalance volumes and subsequent spot electricity prices. We use ordinary least squares regression, quantile regression and autoregressive moving averages to identify these relationships using variables that have a quarter-hourly data granularity. The results show that higher wind and solar forecast errors increase the absolute values of imbalance volumes and that these can pass through into higher spot prices. We find that wind forecast errors in Germany impact spot prices more than solar forecasting errors. Policy incentives to improve the accuracy and availability of renewable energy forecasts by the system operators should therefore be encouraged. © 2019",Electricity imbalance; Electricity spot prices; Forecast errors; Renewable energy,Commerce; Costs; Errors; Solar energy; Weather forecasting; Autoregressive moving average; Electricity spot price; Forecast errors; Ordinary least squares regressions; Policy incentives; Quantile regression; Renewable energies; Spot electricity prices; Power markets; accuracy assessment; alternative energy; available water capacity; electricity industry; energy policy; error analysis; forecasting method; price dynamics; regression analysis; resource availability; Germany,Article

"Chang Z., Zhang Y., Chen W.",Effective Adam-Optimized LSTM Neural Network for Electricity Price Forecasting,2019,8.0,"Electrical energy, considered to be a clean energy source, has made a significant contribution to humanity. To make better use of electric energy, great efforts have been paid by electricity market researchers and practitioners on electricity price forecasting. Long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, performs well in many areas, such as language modeling and speech recognition. However, the performance of applying the LSTM model to process time series and nonlinear regression problems is not so satisfactory. Stochastic gradient-based optimization has core practical importance in many scientific and engineering fields. Adam, a method for efficient stochastic optimization, has combined the advantages of two popular optimization methods: AdaGrad and RMSProp, it makes LSTM model perform even better. In this study, two examples were listed to verify the performance of the Adam-optimized LSTM neural network, and the dataset from New South Wales of Australia were adopted to illustrate the excellence of model.

"Hu F., Feng X., Cao H.",A short-term decision model for electricity retailers: Electricity procurement and time-of-use pricing,2018,8.0,"This paper establishes a short-term decision model, based on robust optimization, for an electricity retailer to determine the electricity procurement and electricity retail prices. The electricity procurement process includes purchasing electricity from generation companies and from the spot market. The selling prices of electricity for the customers are based on time-of-use (TOU) pricing which is widely employed in modern electricity market as a demand response program. The objective of the model is to maximize the expected profit of the retailer through optimizing the electricity procurement strategy and electricity pricing scheme. A price elasticity matrix (PEM) is adopted to model the demand response. Also, uncertainty in spot prices is modeled using a robust optimization approach, in which price bounds are considered instead of predicted values. Using a robust optimization approach, the retailer can adjust the level of robustness of its decisions through a robust control parameter. A case study is presented to illustrate the performance of the model. The simulation results demonstrate that the developed model is effective in increasing the expected profit of the retailer and flattening the load profiles of customers. © 2018 by the authors.",Demand response; Electricity procurement; Robust optimization; Spot market; Time-of-use (TOU) pricing,Commerce; Costs; Optimization; Power markets; Profitability; Robust control; Sales; Demand response; Electricity procurement; Robust optimization; Spot market; Time-of-use pricing; Electric variables measurement,Article
"Peter S.E., Raglend I.J.",Sequential wavelet-ANN with embedded ANN-PSO hybrid electricity price forecasting model for Indian energy exchange,2017,8.0,"This research paper presents a novel sequential wavelet-artificial neural network (ANN) with embedded ANN-particle swarm optimization (PSO) for short-term day-ahead forecasting of market clearing price (MCP) in the Indian energy exchange. A precise price forecasting helps suppliers to set up bidding strategies, make investment decisions and be cautious against risks. Conversely, consumers can use price forecasting to exploit appropriate power purchasing strategies for maximum utility utilization. Here the most influential historical data, namely purchase bid and MCP, are considered for training the feed-forward back-propagation neural network. The proposed model involves three sequential phases. Initially, the raw historical data are smoothened by removing the high-frequency components using a wavelet transform method which may enable better training of neural network. Then, ANN is used to train historical patterns. More number of trials is carried out, and the final weights that give the least training error are stored. In the final phase, the stored weights that are obtained from various trials are used as the initial population for the embedded ANN-PSO model. Here the performance of the proposed forecasting model is carried out using three error indices, namely mean absolute percentage error, normalized mean square error and error variance. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Artificial neural networks; Mean absolute percentage error; Particle swarm optimization; Wavelet transform,Backpropagation; Costs; Errors; Forecasting; Investments; Mean square error; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Wavelet transforms; Electricity price forecasting; Feed-forward back-propagation neural networks; Forecasting modeling; High frequency components; Investment decisions; Market clearing prices; Mean absolute percentage error; Normalized mean square error; Power markets,Article

Day-ahead prediction provides forecast prices for a day ahead that is useful for daily operation and decision-making. The main challenge for day ahead price forecasting is the accuracy and efficiency. Lower accuracy is produced due to the nature of electricity price that is highly volatile compared to load series. Hence, some researchers have developed complex procedures to produce accurate forecast while considering significant features and optimum parameters. Therefore, a multistage optimization for hybrid Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model is developed in this study to provide an accurate price forecast with optimized parameters and input features. So far, no literature has been found on multistage feature and parameter selections using the methods of LSSVM-GA for day-ahead price prediction. All the models are examined on the Ontario power market; which is reported as among the most volatile market worldwide. A huge number of features are selected by two stages of optimization to avoid from missing any important features. The developed LSSVM-GA shows higher forecast accuracy with lower complexity than the existing models. © 2016 IEEE.",Accuracy; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Support vector machines,Commerce; Costs; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Support vector machines; Accuracy; Electrical power system; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Least square support vector machines; Multi-stage optimization; Optimized parameter; Parameter selection; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Domanski P.D., Gintrowski M.",Alternative approaches to the prediction of electricity prices,2017,8.0,"Purpose: This paper aims to present the results of the comparison between different approaches to the prediction of electricity prices. It is well-known that the properties of the data generation process may prefer some modeling methods over the others. The data having an origin in social or market processes are characterized by unexpectedly wide realization space resulting in the existence of the long tails in the probabilistic density function. These data may not be easy in time series prediction using standard approaches based on the normal distribution assumptions. The electricity prices on the deregulated market fall into this category. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents alternative approaches, i.e. memory-based prediction and fractal approach compared with established nonlinear method of neural networks. The appropriate interpretation of results is supported with the statistical data analysis and data conditioning. These algorithms have been applied to the problem of the energy price prediction on the deregulated electricity market with data from Polish and Austrian energy stock exchanges. Findings: The first outcome of the analysis is that there are several situations in the task of time series prediction, when standard modeling approach based on the assumption that each change is independent of the last following random Gaussian bell pattern may not be a true. In this paper, such a case was considered: price data from energy markets. Electricity prices data are biased by the human nature. It is shown that more relevant for data properties was Cauchy probabilistic distribution. Results have shown that alternative approaches may be used and prediction for both data memory-based approach resulted in the best performance. Research limitations/implications: “Personalization” of the model is crucial aspect in the whole methodology. All available knowledge should be used on the forecasted phenomenon and incorporate it into the model. In case of the memory-based modeling, it is a specific design of the history searching routine that uses the understanding of the process features. Importance should shift toward methodology structure design and algorithm customization and then to parameter estimation. Such modeling approach may be more descriptive for the user enabling understanding of the process and further iterative improvement in a continuous striving for perfection. Practical implications: Memory-based modeling can be practically applied. These models have large potential that is worth to be exploited. One disadvantage of this modeling approach is large calculation effort connected with a need of constant evaluation of large data sets. It was shown that a graphics processing unit (GPU) approach through parallel calculation on the graphical cards can improve it dramatically. Social implications: The modeling of the electricity prices has big impact of the daily operation of the electricity traders and distributors. From one side, appropriate modeling can improve performance mitigating risks associated with the process. Thus, the end users should receive higher quality of services ultimately with lower prices and minimized risk of the energy loss incidents. Originality/value: The use of the alternative approaches, such as memory-based reasoning or fractals, is very rare in the field of the electricity price forecasting. Thus, it gives a new impact for further research enabling development of better solutions incorporating all available process knowledge and customized hybrid algorithms. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Artificial intelligence; Econometric; Energy sector; Forecasting; Modelling; Neural networks; Pricing; Time series analysis,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Deregulation; Electronic trading; Energy dissipation; Forecasting; Fractals; Graphics processing unit; Iterative methods; Models; Neural networks; Normal distribution; Power markets; Probability distributions; Program processors; Time series analysis; Deregulated electricity market; Design/methodology/approach; Econometric; Electricity price forecasting; Energy sector; Probabilistic density function; Probabilistic distribution; Statistical data analysis; Costs,Article

In general, different market players need to know future electricity prices as their profitability depends on them. There are many papers have been presented on the forecasting of electricity market price such methods are based on time series, artificial intelligence and hybrid methods. In this paper, the price forecasting is presented by using feed forward artificial neural network by using historical price data.

"Shenoy S., Gorinevsky D.",Data-Driven Stochastic Pricing and Application to Electricity Market,2016,8.0,"This paper develops a novel approach to computation of the probability integrals encountered in derivative pricing using stochastic models estimated from historical data. First, nonparametric probability distribution models are built directly from the data as a solution of a convex optimization problem scalable to very big datasets. Second, these models are used for numerical calculus of probability integrals, where the quadrature includes long tails of the probability distributions. The application example is the procurement contract in the day-ahead bulk market for electricity. The data for PJM utility loads and prices in the day-ahead and spot markets were used to estimate the risk and to price the contract. The data-driven forward contract pricing allows to optimize the contract cost and reduce it by 2% compared to the baseline; this corresponds to about 0.6B/year in potential utility savings. © 2016 IEEE.",Economic forecasting; financial management; power engineering; power generation dispatch; power system analysis computing; power system economics; probability density function; risk analysis,Big data; Calculations; Commerce; Convex optimization; Costs; Electric load dispatching; Power markets; Probability density function; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Economic forecasting; Financial managements; Power engineering; Power generation dispatch; Power system analysis computing; Power system economics; Probability distributions,Article
"Bessec M., Fouquau J., Meritet S.",Forecasting electricity spot prices using time-series models with a double temporal segmentation,2016,8.0,"The French wholesale market is set to expand in the next few years under European pressure and national decisions. In this article, we assess the forecasting ability of several classes of time-series models for electricity wholesale spot prices at a day-ahead horizon in France. Electricity spot prices display a strong seasonal pattern, particularly in France, given the high share of electric heating in housing during winter time. To deal with this pattern, we implement a double temporal segmentation of the data. For each trading period and season, we use a large number of specifications based on market fundamentals: linear regressions, Markov-switching (MS) models and threshold models with a smooth transition. An extensive evaluation on French data shows that modelling each season independently leads to better results. Among nonlinear models, MS models designed to capture the sudden and fast-reverting spikes in the price dynamics yield more accurate forecasts. Finally, pooling forecasts give more reliable results. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",combinations; electricity spot prices; Forecasting; regime-switching; seasonality,electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; Markov chain; modeling; price dynamics; seasonality; time series; France,Article

"Gomez-Quiles C., Gil H.A.",Price and resource-related uncertainty in the estimation of the revenue of a wind farm,2011,8.0,The revenue that wind farms produce is subject to the inherent uncertainty of the wind resource in the short-run and the long-term. This revenue is subject to an additional price-related uncertainty in jurisdictions where the output of the wind farms is paid at the prices cleared at the local electricity market. An econometric model is developed to estimate the risks of using limited information in the estimation of the annual revenue of a wind farm. Sensitivities that measure the influence of each uncertainty factor in the overall risks are also developed. An application example is shown by which investors or policy-makers may determine how typical wind farm capital costs may influence financial project feasibility under a predetermined risk. © 2006 IEEE.,Electricity markets; revenue; risk; wind farms,Annual revenue; Application examples; Capital costs; Econometric model; Electricity market; Limited information; Policy makers; Project feasibility; revenue; Uncertainty factors; Wind farm; wind farms; Wind resources; Costs; Electric utilities; Estimation; Farms; Risk perception; Wind power; Commerce,Article
"Shrestha G.B., Qiao S.",Statistical characterization of electricity price in competitive power markets,2010,8.0,"Forecasting of electricity price in the competitive power market has become very important for the market participants in order to support their planning and operations activities. In addition to the change in prices caused by the demand levels (reflected in normal interaction between supply and demand), numerous other factors affect the electricity price including the sudden surges in prices which are frequently caused by unexpected outages. This paper attempts to represent the price at any one period as a random variable which may be treated statistically. Historical price data from Singapore market (USEP) are used to study the behavior of the market price in order to identify the possible statistical distributions and then hypothesis tests are formulated and carried out to determine the theoretical distributions which are best supported by the historical data. It is shown that the raw price data may not be directly amenable to statistical representation. However, suitable processing of the data such as filtering out the extreme values or suitable regrouping of the data may be carried out to bring out the underlying statistical characteristics of the price behavior. It is shown that the market price behavior may support more than one theoretical distribution although the log normal distribution was found to fit the historical data best. ©2010 IEEE.","Competitive electricity market; Electricity price; Hypothesis testing; Statistical distributions - normal, log-normal, and weibull distributions",Competitive electricity markets; Competitive power markets; Electricity price; Electricity prices; Extreme value; Historical data; Hypothesis testing; Hypothesis tests; Log-normal distribution; Market participants; Market price; Singapore; Statistical characteristics; Statistical characterization; Statistical distribution; Statistical representations; Supply and demand; Commerce; Data processing; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Normal distribution; Random variables; Statistical tests; Statistics; Weibull distribution; Costs,Conference Paper

"Tang Q., Gu D.",Day-ahead electricity prices forecasting using artificial neural networks,2009,8.0,"This paper presents specifically how artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to forecast day-ahead electricity price in the deregulated electricity market. Market clearing price (MCP) forecasting has been more and more significant in new restructured market because both generating companies and consumers rely on it to prepare their bidding strategies and expect to maximize respective benefits with low risks. But the prediction of MCP is complex because various uncertainties interact in an intricate way. Hence, ANN is proposed to solve high complicated nonlinear problems like MCP forecasting due to its powerful capability of learning mechanism if enough data for training. The paper focuses on influences brought by different input architectures with different training methods and proposes a basic optimal ANN architecture for day-ahead MCP forecasting. © 2009 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Forecasting; Market clearing price,Artificial neural network; Bidding strategy; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity prices; Electricity prices forecasting; Generating companies; Learning mechanism; Market Clearing Price; Market clearing prices; Nonlinear problems; Training methods; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric load forecasting; Image storage tubes; Linearization; Neural networks,Conference Paper
"Azadeh A., Ghadrei S.F., Nokhandan B.P.",One day-ahead price forecasting for electricity market of iran using combined time series and neural network model,2009,8.0,"Price forecasts provide crucial information for generators. They plan bidding strategies for maximizing their own profits in the competitive electricity markets. Hence, generation companies (GENCOs) need precise price forecasting tools. This paper provides one highly accurate yet efficient tool for short term price forecasting based on combination of time series and artificial neural network methods (ANNs). First, input variables needed for neural network are determined by time series. This model relates the current price to the values of past prices. Second, neural network is used for one day a head price forecasting. Designed ANN based on feed-forward back propagation was trained and tested using year 2005 data from the electricity market of Iran.

"Zarezadeh M., Naghavi A., Ghaderi S.F.",Electricity price forecasting in Iranian electricity market applying Artificial Neural Networks,2008,8.0,"Nowadays in deregulated electricity markets, forecasting becomes more and more important. Accurate estimating price is the most essential task and the basis for any decision making and developing biding strategies. In this paper Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is applied to forecast electricity price. ANNs have been used successfully in many forecasting applications recently. Historical data of weighted average prices in electricity market that cleared with pay as bid settlement rule and also forecasted electricity demand are used to train neural networks (NN) model. The data for historical electricity prices are considered by two criterion of temperature and load in order to improve training. Data are categorized in to two seasonal parts of warm and cold days and also they are categorized by three loads level of low, normal and peak. To support better accuracy of estimating prices six different NN architectures are modeled for combination of the criterions, the NN also selected electricity prices of similar days in previous year. In the end, the results of forecasting prices of ANNs are compared with the results obtained from regression model. There is confirmed that, AANs have better performance comparing to traditional method in forecasting electricity prices. © 2008 IEEE.",Electricity markets; Electricity price; Forecast; Historical data; Neural network (NN); Regression model,Backpropagation; Costs; Deregulation; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electricity; Marketing; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Electricity markets; Electricity price; Forecast; Historical data; Neural network (NN); Regression model; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper
"Nunes C., Pacheco A., Silva T.",Statistical models to predict electricity prices,2008,8.0,"In the last years, electricity markets have been changing from monopolies to liberalized markets, and consequently, with the entrance of new providers, there has been an increase of competitiveness. With the creation of open markets utilities faced the need to understand the way electricity prices change, in order to better develop bidding and hedging strategies. This paper focuses on the Spanish electricity market. In order to develop a model capable of evaluating and predicting the Spanish electricity prices, we use data from January 1998 until August 2005. In addition, as one of the aims is to get short and medium term forecasts, we analyze the data in a daily and monthly basis, using different techniques. In the daily prices, we use SARIMA models complemented with GARCH models. For the monthly prices, two different approaches are considered: time series models, and generalized least squares models with autocorrelated residuals. ©2008 IEEE.",Electricity price; Forecasting; GLS models with autocorrelated errors; SARIMA and GARCH models,Competition; Costs; Curve fitting; Forecasting; Industrial economics; Least squares approximations; Marketing; Time series analysis; Electricity markets; Electricity price; GLS models with autocorrelated errors; SARIMA and GARCH models; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper

Although simple neural networks with sufficient number neuron units in the hidden layer are capable of following dynamics of any deterministic system, the weight search space becomes too complex to be searched using a simple back propagation based training algorithm. This paper presents and evaluates two alternative methods for finding the optimum weights of a neural network to capture the chaotic dynamics of electricity price data.

"Li C., Zhang M.",Application of GARCH model in the forecasting of day-ahead electricity prices,2007,8.0,"In the new deregulated electric power industry, price forecasting is becoming increasingly important for the producers and consumers to estimate and maximize their profits. A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) methodology is presented to predict day-ahead electricity prices. For the high volatility of the electricity prices, the GARCH model is more suitable for illustrating the time series data than other forecast model adopted generally. The prediction error is assumed to be serially correlated other than independent variable with zero mean and constant variance, which can be modeled by an Auto Regressive process. Based on the initial values of the parameters of the model gained by Eviews software, Genetic arithmetic is used to optimize them to improve its performance.

Three kinds of factors: the historical loads and MCPs, the behavior of the participants and the reliability level of the power system, are considered as the inputs of the model. Secondly, based on the characteristic of self-organizing and clustering of Self-Organizing Map (SOM), a method is proposed to deal with the sample dataset of the BP model, which can perform a consistency analysis, and then form a new training dataset. Historical loads and prices of 2002 in Queensland of Australian day-ahead energy market are used for training and forecasting test.

"Hille E., Möbius P.",Do energy prices affect employment? Decomposed international evidence,2019,7.0,"This paper analyzes the energy price-employment nexus and contributes to the literature by showing that it is important to decompose the regulatory effect into demand, cost, and factor-shift effects. This is done by means of a cross-country multi-sectoral dataset. The results show that both rising energy prices and shadow prices of energy have no significant effect on net employment when the manufacturing sectors only are analyzed. While finding significant variations across countries, the average employment effects become significantly positive once jobs in the economy as a whole are considered. This change is driven mainly by larger positive cost effects, which more than offset the negative demand effects and reductions in the positive factor-shift effects. Moreover, the paper reveals that the often implemented approach of using a simple regulation regressor, instead of decomposing the employment effect, can result in biased estimates. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Climate policy; Employment; Energy prices; Shadow prices,Employment; Biased estimates; Climate policy; Employment effects; Energy prices; Manufacturing sector; Negative demands; Regulatory effects; Shadow price; Costs; decomposition analysis; employment; energy market; environmental policy; implementation process; international comparison; regulatory approach,Article

"Díaz G., Coto J., Gómez-Aleixandre J.",Prediction and explanation of the formation of the Spanish day-ahead electricity price through machine learning regression,2019,7.0,"Until recently, detailed information on the power system state to estimate future spot prices by regression analysis was generally restricted to qualified parties. However, to ensure transparency in operation, the Spanish Transmission System Operator has launched an informative web in which a sizable amount of real-time energy-related data can be consulted through a graphical interface. Undoubtedly, this provides the opportunity for non-qualified parties to develop applications and algorithms in which price forecast and maybe knowledge about how price is determined are required. This paper approaches the use of data extracted from that interface with two aims: the prediction of the day-ahead price in a simple way, and the exploration of the influence that the underlying energy drivers have on it. For the prediction we specified a quantile regression model based on Gradient Boosted Regression Trees. It improves the accuracy over multiple linear regression models at the cost of more complexity, and still it has simpler specification and tuning compared to other machine learning approaches. The calculated metrics show that our model produces remarkably low prediction errors when using the median as point prediction method (RMSE = 2.78 €/MWh, MAE = 1.94 €/MWh, and MAPE = 0.059). Interestingly, the quantile regression model also allows to inherently define prediction intervals, with a different interpretation of accuracy. Our results show that on average 90% of times the prediction error will not exceed 6.8 €/MWh. We also implemented a partial dependence analysis on that model. This implementation—as far as we know the first time employed to analyze the formation of electricity prices—has shown to be of significant usefulness in detecting highly non-linear relationships. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Day-ahead electricity price; Gradient boosting regression; Linear regression; Principal components; Quantile regression,Costs; Electric power transmission; Forecasting; Linear regression; Machine learning; Electricity prices; Gradient boosting; Machine learning approaches; Multiple linear regression models; Non-linear relationships; Principal Components; Quantile regression; Transmission system operators; Power markets; electricity; energy market; exploration; machine learning; operations technology; prediction; principal component analysis; regression analysis; Spain,Article
"Grossi L., Nan F.","Robust forecasting of electricity prices: Simulations, models and the impact of renewable sources",2019,7.0,"In this paper a robust approach to modeling electricity spot prices is introduced. Differently from what has been recently done in the literature on electricity price forecasting, where the attention has been mainly drawn by the prediction of spikes, the focus of this contribution is on the robust estimation of nonlinear SETARX models (Self-Exciting Threshold Auto Regressive models with eXogenous regressors). In this way, parameter estimates are not, or very lightly, influenced by the presence of extreme observations and the large majority of prices, which are not spikes, could be better forecasted. A Monte Carlo study is carried out in order to select the best weighting function for Generalized M-estimators of SETAR processes. A robust procedure to select and estimate nonlinear processes for electricity prices is introduced, including robust tests for stationarity and nonlinearity and robust information criteria. The application of the procedure to the Italian electricity market reveals the forecasting superiority of the robust GM-estimator based on the polynomial weighting function with respect to the non-robust Least Squares estimator. Finally, the introduction of generation from renewable sources in the robust estimation of SETARX processes contributes to the improvement of the forecasting ability of the model. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Electricity price; Nonlinear time series; Price forecasting; Robust GM-estimator; Spikes; Threshold models,Forecasting; Power markets; Time series analysis; Electricity prices; Nonlinear time series; Price forecasting; Robust GM-estimator; Spikes; Threshold model; Cost estimating; computer simulation; electricity generation; energy market; estimation method; forecasting method; nonlinearity; numerical model; renewable resource; time series analysis; Italy,Article

"Pórtoles J., González C., Moguerza J.M.",Electricity Price Forecasting with Dynamic Trees: A Benchmark Against the Random Forest Approach,2018,7.0,"Dynamic Trees are a tree-based machine learning technique specially designed for online environments where data are to be analyzed sequentially as they arrive. Our purpose is to test this methodology for the very first time for Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) by using data from the Iberian market. For benchmarking the results, we will compare them against another tree-based technique, Random Forest, a widely used method that has proven its good results in many fields. The benchmark includes several versions of the Dynamic Trees approach for a very short term EPF (one-hour ahead) and also a short term (one-day ahead) approach but only with the best versions. The numerical results show that Dynamic Trees are an adequate method, both for very short and short term EPF—even improving upon the performance of the Random Forest method. The comparison with other studies for the Iberian market suggests that Dynamic Trees is a proper and promising method for EPF. 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

"He J., Zhao C., Cai L., Cheng P., Shi L.",Practical closed-loop dynamic pricing in smart grid for supply and demand balancing,2018,7.0,"Pricing strategy for power systems is an important and challenging problem, due to the difficulties in predicting the demand and the reactions of customers to the price accurately. Any prediction errors may result in higher costs to the supplier. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel, practical closed-loop pricing algorithm (PCPA). Using the closed-loop control to well coordinate the customers and the supplier, the power system can run more efficiently, resulting in both cost saving for customers and higher profit for the supplier. We prove the convergence of PCPA, i.e., a stable price can be achieved. We provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the win-win solution for both the customers and the supplier, and an upper bound of the gain. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition of that the highest win for both the customers and the supplier can be achieved. Extensive simulations have shown that PCPA can outperform the existing prediction-based pricing algorithms. It shows that the profit gain of the proposed algorithm can up to 100% when the total demand can be fixed to the optimal demand. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Closed-loop control; Demand and supply; Pricing algorithm; Smart grid; Win-win solution,Costs; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Profitability; Sales; Smart power grids; Closed-loop control; Demand and supply; Pricing algorithm; Smart grid; Win-win solutions; Closed loop control systems,Article

"Unger E.A., Ulfarsson G.F., Gardarsson S.M., Matthiasson T.",A long-term analysis studying the effect of changes in the Nordic electricity supply on Danish and Finnish electricity prices,2017,7.0,"The aim of this research was to perform a multinational analysis that estimates the marginal effect of changes in different sources used to generate electricity on wholesale Nordic electricity prices. Three price series were selected: (1) the Nord Pool market clearing price, (2) western Denmark's area spot price (DK1), and (3) Finland's (FI) area spot price. Data were drawn for the 16 years, 2000–2015. Linear regression was used. The results showed that changes in the energy sources used to supply electricity had varying impacts, showing that average annual prices were affected more when there was a decrease in nuclear production levels rather than an increase.

Bennedsen M.,A rough multi-factor model of electricity spot prices,2017,7.0,"We introduce a new continuous-time mathematical model of electricity spot prices which accounts for the most important stylized facts of these time series: seasonality, spikes, stochastic volatility, and mean reversion. Empirical studies have found a possible fifth stylized fact, roughness, and our approach explicitly incorporates this into the model of the prices. Our setup generalizes the popular Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-based multi-factor framework of Benth et al. (2007) and allows us to perform statistical tests to distinguish between an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-based model and a rough model. Further, through the multi-factor approach we account for seasonality and spikes before estimating – and making inference on – the degree of roughness. This is novel in the literature and we present simulation evidence showing that these precautions are crucial for accurate estimation. Lastly, we estimate our model on recent data from six European energy exchanges and find statistical evidence of roughness in five out of six markets. As an application of our model, we show how, in these five markets, a rough component improves short term forecasting of the prices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity prices; Energy markets; Forecasting; Fractals; Mean reversion; Multi-factor modeling; Roughness,Commerce; Continuous time systems; Costs; Estimation; Forecasting; Fractals; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Surface roughness; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Energy markets; European energy exchanges; Mean reversion; Multi factors; Short-term forecasting; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic models; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; fractal analysis; numerical model; price determination; Europe,Article
"Varshney H., Sharma A., Kumar R.",A hybrid approach to price forecasting incorporating exogenous variables for a day ahead electricity Market,2017,7.0,"Predicting Location Based Market Price (LBMP) in real time is an important and complex task that involves a great accuracy to model extreme spikes. Occurrence of spikes in real time LBMP is due to uncertainty in load demand as well as a significant variation in surrounding temperature throughout the day. These fluctuations cause extreme spikes in market clearing price due to transmission outages, shortage of supply and consumption of costly generation reserves. Therefore, the market participants are forced to purchase the electricity at very high price but the regulation set on the price cap by market authorities results into an economic loss to retailers and market participants. Accordingly, accurate forecasting of price is an important exercise to hedge against volatility. This paper proposes a hybrid technique comprising singular spectrum analysis and neural network incorporating temperature and load data for forecasting in day ahead electricity market. The results obtained with this hybrid technique are found to be more accurate when compared to existing methods described in literature. © 2016 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; neural network; real time forecast; singular spectrum analysis,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Intelligent control; Losses; Neural networks; Plasma diagnostics; Power control; Power electronics; Spectrum analysis; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Exogenous variables; Market Clearing Price; Market participants; Real-time forecasts; Singular spectrum analysis; Surrounding temperature; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Wolff G., Feuerriegel S.",Short-term dynamics of day-ahead and intraday electricity prices,2017,7.0,"Purpose: Since the liberalization of electricity markets in the European Union, prices are subject to market dynamics. Hence, understanding the short-term drivers of electricity prices is of major interest to electricity companies and policymakers. Accordingly, this paper aims to study movements of prices in the combined German and Austrian electricity market. Design/methodology/approach: This paper estimates an autoregressive model with exogenous variables (ARX) in a two-step procedure. In the first step, both time series, which inherently feature seasonality, are de-seasonalized, and in the second step, the influence of all model variables on the two dependent variables, i.e. the day-ahead and intraday European Power Energy Exchange prices, is measured. Findings: The results reveal that the short-term market is largely driven by seasonality, consumer demand and short-term feed-ins from renewable energy sources. As a contribution to the existing body of literature, this paper specifically compares the price movements in day-ahead and intraday markets. In intraday markets, the influences of renewable energies are much stronger than in day-ahead markets, i.e. by 24.12 per cent for wind and 116.82 per cent for solar infeeds. Originality/value: Knowledge on the price setting mechanism in the intraday market is particularly scarce. This paper contributes to existing research on this topic by deriving drivers in the intraday market and then contrasting them to the day-ahead market. A more thorough understanding is especially crucial for all stakeholders, who can use this knowledge to optimize their bidding strategies. Furthermore, the findings suggest policy implications for a more stable and efficient electricity market. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Autoregressive; Electricity; External drivers; Modelling; Pricing; Renewable energies; Time series analysis; Weather influence,Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric industry; Electricity; Models; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive model with exogenous variable (ARX); Dependent variables; Design/methodology/approach; Electricity companies; Policy implications; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Power markets,Article
"Zarnikau J., Woo C.-K., Zhu S.",Zonal merit-order effects of wind generation development on day-ahead and real-time electricity market prices in Texas,2016,7.0,"This paper uses a regression-based approach to explore the impact of wind generation development on wholesale electricity prices in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market. We find that wind generation development has a greater effect on real-time market (RTM) prices than day-ahead market (DAM) prices. Higher wind generation forecast errors tend to reduce the RTMprices, chiefly because unanticipated increases in wind generation reduce the real-time net loads to be served by fossil fuel power plants. Improving ERCOT’s load and wind generation forecast accuracy tends to make theDAMand RTMprices converge, thus enhancing ERCOT’s market trading efficiency. Finally, the estimated merit-order effects are greatest in the ERCOT zones where the wind generation capacity locally resides. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.",Day-ahead market; Electric reliability council of texas (ercot); Merit-order effects; Real-time market; Wind generation,,Article
"Dash S.K., Bisoi R., Dash P.K.",A hybrid functional link dynamic neural network and evolutionary unscented Kalman filter for short-term electricity price forecasting,2016,7.0,"Electricity price is an important aspect in a restructured power market. Because of nonlinearity, nonstationary, and volatility of electricity price, it is highly essential to forecast the price on a short-term scale. This paper presents an efficient method based on a hybrid functional link dynamic neural network (DNN) trained by an adaptive robust unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The proposed method forecasts hourly prices for the day-ahead electricity market. The functional block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher-dimensional space through a basis function without using any hidden layer like multilayer perceptron structure. The DNN includes one or more infinite impulse response filters in the forward path providing feedback connections between outputs and inputs. This allows signal flow in both forward and backward directions, giving the network a dynamic memory useful to mimic dynamic systems. Also to improve the accuracy of the forecast, the noise covariance matrices of the UKF are adapted recursively.

"Reddy S.S., Jung C.-M., Seog K.J.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using back propagation neural networks and weighted least square technique,2016,7.0,"This paper proposes the day-ahead electricity price forecasting using the artificial neural networks (ANN) and weighted least square (WLS) technique in the restructured electricity markets. Price forecasting is very important for online trading, e-commerce and power system operation. Forecasting the hourly locational marginal prices (LMP) in the electricity markets is a very important basis for the decision making in order to maximize the profits/benefits. The novel approach proposed in this paper for forecasting the electricity prices uses WLS technique and compares the results with the results obtained by using ANNs. To perform this price forecasting, the market knowledge is utilized to optimize the selection of input data for the electricity price forecasting tool. In this paper, price forecasting for Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection is demonstrated using the ANNs and the proposed WLS technique. The data used for this price forecasting is obtained from the PJM website. The forecasting results obtained by both methods are compared, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting approach. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the accuracy of prediction has increased in both seasons using the proposed WLS technique. Another important advantage of the proposed WLS technique is that it is not an iterative method. © 2016, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",artificial neural networks; day-ahead electricity markets; load forecasting; load serving entities; price forecasting,,Article

The proposed architecture combines the advantages of the easy-to-use and relatively easy-to-tune Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and the approximation power of local learning techniques. The architecture is robust and more accurate than the individual forecasting methodologies on which it is based, since it combines a reliable built-in linear model (ARIMA) with an adaptive dynamic corrector (Lazy Learning algorithm).

"Safarinejadian B., Gharibzadeh M., Rakhshan M.",An optimized model of electricity price forecasting in the electricity market based on fuzzy time series,2014,7.0,"Electricity price forecasting in the electricity market is one of the important purposes for improving the performance of market players and increasing their profits in a competitive electricity market. Since the system load is one of the important factors affecting electricity price changes, a two-factorial model based on fuzzy time series is presented in this paper for electricity price forecasting using the electricity prices of the previous days and the system load. In the proposed method, price and system load time series are fuzzified by fuzzy sets created based on the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. After determining proposed model coefficients by the Teaching–Learning-Based Optimization algorithm, this model is used for forecasting the next day electricity price.

"Feuerriegel S., Riedlinger S., Neumann D.",Predictive analytics for electricity prices using feed-ins from renewables,2014,7.0,"Since the liberalization of European electricity markets, stakeholders can actively participate in the trading of electricity. Successful participation in such markets requires an accurate forecast of future electricity prices. However, as large volumes of energy from renewable sources are fed into the system, electricity prices are highly volatile. While recent approaches put a strong focus on models from time series analysis using merely historic prices, only a few study the influence of exogenous predictors. This paper includes both expected solar power generation and expected wind power generation as exogenous predictors and improves state of the art by assessing their beneficial impact when evaluating our forecasting models with a two-pronged approach.

Kury T.J.,Price effects of independent transmission system operators in the United States electricity market,2013,7.0,"In 1996, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) sought to ""remove impediments to competition in the wholesale bulk power marketplace and to bring more efficient, lower cost power to the Nation's electricity consumers"" through a series of market rules. A product of these rules was the establishment of regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) charged with facilitating equal access to the transmission grid for electricity suppliers. Whether these changes in market structure have succeeded in achieving FERC's goal to provide ""lower cost power to the Nation's electricity consumers"" remains an open question. This paper utilizes a panel data set of the 48 contiguous United States and a treatment effects model in first differences to determine whether there have been changes in delivered electric prices as a result of the establishment of ISOs and RTOs. To avoid the confounding effects of electric restructuring, the model is estimated with the full panel data set, and then again without the states that have restructured their electric markets. This estimation shows that electricity prices fall approximately 4. 8 % in the first 2 years of an ISO's operation and that this result is statistically significant. However, this result is dependent on the presence of states that restructured their electricity markets. When these restructured states are removed from the data set the price effects of RTOs become indistinguishable from zero. The paper concludes that rate agreements are the principal source of the observed decrease in prices and that RTOs have not had the desired effect on electricity prices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Electricity market reform; Electricity market structure; Regional transmission organizations,,Article

"Leevongwat I., Rastgoufard P.",Forecasting locational marginal pricing in deregulated power markets,2009,7.0,"This investigation focuses on development of new methodologies for implementing power systems optimization for forecasting Location Marginal Prices (LMP) in deregulated electricity markets. The proposed approach uses the LMP method [1-3] to show relationships between generator bids, power system constraints, and electricity demand. The proposed approach uses Unit Commitment, Economic Dispatch, and Optimal Power Flow to perform load flow analysis that includes LMP calculation to determine price of electricity. This paper includes the main part of the investigation that addresses integration of locational marginal pricing within the traditional structure of optimization constraints including economic constraints, operational and security constraints including system real power balance, unit operating limits, transmission flow limits, interface limits, and contingency constraints. The integration of LMP and the constraints of optimization outlined in this paper may serve as a foundation for inclusion of environmental constraints, system spinning reserve constraints, and system operating reserve constraints in the future.

"Zhou Q., Tesfatsion L., Liu C.-C.",Scenario generation for price forecasting in restructured wholesale power markets,2009,7.0,"In current restructured wholesale power markets, the short length of time series for prices makes it difficult to use empirical price data to test existing price forecasting tools and to develop new price forecasting tools. This study therefore proposes a two-stage approach for generating simulated price scenarios based on the available price data. The first stage consists of an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model for determining scenarios of cleared demands and scheduled generator outages (D&O), and a moment-matching method for reducing the number of D&O scenarios to a practical scale. In the second stage, polynomials are fitted between D&O and wholesale power prices in order to obtain price scenarios for a specified time frame. Time series data from the Midwest ISO (MISO) are used as a test system to validate the proposed approach. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach is able to generate price scenarios for distinct seasons with empirically realistic characteristics. ©2009 IEEE.",ARMA model; Moment-matching method; Restructured wholesale power markets; Scenario generation; Wholesale power prices,ARMA model; Moment-matching method; Restructured wholesale power markets; Scenario generation; Wholesale power prices; Commerce; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Method of moments; Power transmission; Time series; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper
"Gibescu M., Kling W.L., van Zwet E.W.",Bidding and regulating strategies in a dual imbalance pricing system: Case study for a Dutch wind producer,2008,7.0,"In this work, offshore wind power forecast and realisation data are combined with price information from the day-ahead market operated by the Amsterdam Power Exchange and from the imbalance market operated by the Dutch System Operator. This allows for computing spot-market revenues and imbalance penalties or gains for a wind power producer. Three different cases are evaluated: a perfect forecast, actual forecasting error distribution with median contracting and with 'optimal quantile' contracting. The optimal quantile is determined from the probability distribution of the random average wind power production and depends on price predictions for the spot and imbalance prices. The wind producer can use two down-regulating strategies to avoid being charged for excess energy during times when the surplus price becomes negative. The optimal quantile bidding combined with a strategy of down-regulating to contract level produces a comparable yearly revenue with that of an equivalent deterministic producer.

"Hassan M.Y., Majid M.S., Hussin F., Rahman H.A., Lo K.L.",Certain considerations in pricing unbundled transmission services,2006,7.0,"In deregulated environment, the transmission network is considered to be the key factor of the electricity markets. One of the important issues in this context is how to charge the users for the use of transmission facilities in the fair way and at the same time allowing the transmission utilities to recover their transmission costs. Several methodologies have been developed to recover the cost of transmission services and to estimate the power contributed by single generating unit in lines and loads. Both developed methods attempt to allocate the charge of the use of the transmission system. This paper describes certain aspects to be considered in pricing the unbundled transmission services. These aspects cover the type of transmission services, the costs related to the services and the methods used to calculate the costs of transmission services. This paper also proposes a new approach to allocate the costs of the transmission services among the transmission user utilising the properties of MW-mile based method. A case study based on a 6-bus system is used to highlight the merit of the proposed approach over the existing approaches. The case study results show that the proposed approach provides a better economic signal in allocating the charges to the transmission user. © 2006 IEEE.",Deregulation; MW-mile method; Postage stamp method and locational charges; Transmission services,Deregulation; Electric power transmission; Fees and charges; Finance; Recovery; Transmissions; (PL) properties; 6 bus system; case studies; Deregulated environments; Electricity markets; Generating units; International (CO); Key factors; MW mile; new approaches; transmission costs; Transmission facilities; Transmission network; Transmission services; Transmission systems; Cost benefit analysis,Conference Paper

"Muniain P., Ziel F.",Probabilistic forecasting in day-ahead electricity markets: Simulating peak and off-peak prices,2020,6.0,"In this article we include dependency structures for electricity price forecasting and forecasting evaluation. We work with off-peak and peak time series from the German-Austrian day-ahead price; hence, we analyze bivariate data. We first estimate the mean of the two time series, and then in a second step we estimate the residuals. The mean equation is estimated by ordinary least squares and the elastic net, and the residuals are estimated by maximum likelihood. Our contribution is to include a bivariate jump component in a mean reverting jump diffusion model in the residuals. The models’ forecasts are evaluated with use of four different criteria, including the energy score to measure whether the correlation structure between the time series is properly included. It is observed that the models with bivariate jumps provide better results with the energy score, which means that it is important to consider this structure to properly forecast correlated time series. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters",Bivariate Bernoulli; Dependency structure; Elastic net estimation; Electricity price forecasting; Energy score; Ensemble forecasting; Forecasting evaluation; GARCH; Jump diffusion process; Pinball score,,Article
"Wang J., Yang W., Du P., Niu T.",Outlier-robust hybrid electricity price forecasting model for electricity market management,2020,6.0,"Electricity market management is of great importance for cleaner production in the development of society. However, despite this significance, electricity price forecasting remains a challenging task. Hybrid models are widely employed for forecasting electricity price, which has the characteristics of being non-stationarity, random, and non-linear. Despite their success, current hybrid models require improvement. In particular, data preprocessing, artificial intelligence optimization, feature selection, and basic forecasting engine selection should be considered. In this study, in addition to these issues, we consider the negative influence of outliers on the modeling of electricity price. In particular, a novel outlier-robust hybrid model is developed for forecasting electricity price, which combines a basic forecasting engine called outlier-robust extreme learning machine model and three new algorithms. Specifically, a new optimizer called chaotic sine cosine algorithm is developed to obtain the ideal parameters for phase space reconstruction, and then a novel feature selection method is developed to construct the optimal features in the modeling of electricity price. Moreover, an effective data preprocessing method is proposed for effective forecasting by capturing electricity price features. Subsequently, experiments based on electricity price data from the electricity markets of Australia and Singapore demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to other benchmark models. Further, the model can be a reliable forecasting method not only in electricity market management, but also in modeling time series with complex nonlinear characteristics and outliers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity market; Electricity price; Hybrid model; Multi-step forecasting,Commerce; Electric industry; Engines; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Machine learning; Phase space methods; Pollution control; Statistics; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Extreme learning machine; Feature selection methods; Hybrid model; Multi-step forecasting; Nonlinear characteristics; Phase space reconstruction; Power markets,Article
"Marcjasz G., Uniejewski B., Weron R.",Beating the naïve-combining lasso with naïve intraday electricity price forecasts,2020,6.0,"In the last three decades the vast majority of electricity price forecasting (EPF) research has concerned day-ahead markets. However, the rapid expansion of renewable generation-mostly wind and solar-have shifted the focus to intraday markets, which can be used to balance the deviations between positions taken in the day-ahead market and the actual demand and renewable generation. A recent EPF study claims that the German intraday, continuous-time market for hourly products is weak-form efficient, that is, that the best predictor for the so-called ID3-Price index is the most recent transaction price. Here, we undermine this claim and show that we can beat the naïve forecast by combining it with a prediction of a parameter-rich model estimated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We further argue, that that if augmented with timely predictions of fundamental variables for the coming hours, the LASSO-estimated model itself can significantly outperform the naïve forecast. © 2020 by the authors.",Averaging forecasts; Fundamental variables; ID3-Price index; Intraday electricity market; LASSO; Price forecasting; Variable selection,Continuous time systems; Forecasting; Fundamental variables; LASSO; Price forecasting; Price index; Variable selection; Power markets,Article
Punzi M.T.,The impact of energy price uncertainty on macroeconomic variables,2019,6.0,"This paper evaluates the macroeconomic implications of energy price volatility through the lens of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model in an open economy. The model develops a small open economy in which households consume energy products and firms use energy as productivity inputs, where the country is so small that it needs to import energy, the price of which is determined abroad. Whereas positive energy price shocks cause an economic slowdown due to higher costs for consumers and firms, energy price volatility shocks generate an increase in GDP in the short-run and a reversal in the long-run. These findings are empirically supported by estimates from a Panel VAR model applied to 10 Asian economies, where energy price volatility has a positive impact on GDP in the short-run. Moreover, the paper finds that increasing demand or supply uncertainty also affect energy prices, with amplified fluctuations relative to a model that abstracts from energy. Market volatility leads households to cut consumption for precautionary savings motives, which in turn increases investment. Both energy price and uncertainty fluctuation lead to high macroeconomic volatility in the business cycle. Policy makers should encourage investment in energy security and renewable energy, such that households and firms would become less responding to fluctuations in the non-renewable energy market. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",C32 E21; DSGE model; E22; Energy price; F41; Panel VAR; Q43; Stochastic volatility; Uncertainty,Commerce; Costs; Energy policy; Energy security; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Value engineering; C32 E21; DSGE models; Energy prices; Panel vars; Stochastic volatility; Uncertainty; Investments; alternative energy; business cycle; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; energy market; energy policy; Gross Domestic Product; household energy; investment; macroeconomics; policy making; price dynamics; stochasticity,Article
"Ghayekhloo M., Azimi R., Ghofrani M., Menhaj M.B., Shekari E.",A combination approach based on a novel data clustering method and Bayesian recurrent neural network for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets,2019,6.0,"Electricity price forecasting is an ancillary service that plays a key role for market participants in a deregulated structure. Compared to other commodities, electricity price exhibits higher levels of volatility and uncertainty. This imposes more restrictions on the accuracy of the forecast and leads to significant errors. This paper proposes a hybrid electricity price-forecasting framework with a novel time series data mining method to enhance the feature selection. The proposed method includes clustering, preprocessing and training stages. The proposed data clustering method uses both an enhanced game theoretic approach and neural gas in combination with competitive Hebbian learning to provide a better vector quantization. Six strategies are proposed to enable the non-winning neurons to participate in the learning phase and resolve the shortcomings of the original self-organizing map, where the dead neurons are far from the input patterns without having any chance to compete with the winning neurons. The price-load input data are clustered into a proper number of subsets using the proposed data mining method. A novel cluster selection method based on the persistence approach is applied to select the most appropriate cluster as the input to the BRNN. The selected data set is filtered by the harmonic analysis time series, and is time-series processed to provide the proper inputs for training neural networks. Bayesian approach is used to train a recurrent neural network, and forecast the electricity price. The performance of the proposed clustering algorithm is evaluated using different electricity market data. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed clustering algorithm as compared to K-means, neural gas and self-organizing map clustering methods Our proposed clustering provides 16.7%, 28.6%, and 13% more accurate results than K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map for the NYISO. CAPITL data. For the NYISO. CENTRL data, the developed clustering outperforms the K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map by 21.4%, 21.4%, and 8.3%, respectively.

"Keynia F., Heydari A.",A new short-term energy price forecasting method based on wavelet neural network,2019,6.0,"A wavelet neural network (WNN) is proposed for short-term price forecasting (STPF) in electricity markets. Back propagation algorithm is used for training the wavelet neural network for prediction. Weights in the back propagation algorithm are usually initialised with small random values. If the random initial weights happen to be far from a suitable solution or near a poor local optimum, training may take a long time or get trapped in the local optimum. In this paper, we show that WNN has acceptable prediction properties compared to other forecasting techniques. We investigated proper weight initialisations of WNN, and proved that it attains a superior prediction performance. Finally, we used a two-step correlation analysis algorithm for input selecting. This algorithm selects the best relevant and non-redundant input features for WNN.

"Xiong H., Mamon R.",A higher-order Markov chain-modulated model for electricity spot-price dynamics,2019,6.0,"Over the last three decades, the electricity sector worldwide underwent massive deregulation. Power market participants have encountered a growing number of challenges due to competition and other pertinent factors. For most markets at present, electricity is a non-storable commodity and its price is extremely sensitive to changes in supply and demand. The evolution of electricity prices exhibits pronounced mean reversion and cyclical patterns, possesses extreme volatility and relatively frequently occurring spikes, and manifests presence of memory property. These observed features necessitate the development of models aimed to simultaneously capture such price characteristics for forecasting, risk management, and valuation of electricity-driven derivatives. Majority of current research studies examining electricity spot prices are based on one-state models. Such models though may not accurately capture the stylised behaviours of price evolution, especially during periods of sudden spikes driven by the abrupt changes of market sentiments. This paper tackles the modelling and estimation problems under a new paradigm that integrates the deterministic calendar seasons and stochastic factors governing electricity prices with a regime-switching feature. The de-seasonalised component of our proposed model has both the jump and mean-reverting properties to account for spikes and periodic cycles alternating between lower price returns and compensating periods of higher price returns. The parameters of the de-seasonalised model components are also modulated by a higher-order hidden Markov chain (HOHMC) in discrete time. This provides a mechanism to extract latent information from historical data. The HOHMC's state is interpreted as the “state of the world” resulting from the interaction of various forces impacting the electricity market. Filters are developed to generate optimal estimates of HOHMC-relevant quantities using the observation process, and these provide online estimates of model parameters. Empirical demonstrations using the daily electricity spot prices, compiled by the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO), show that our HOHMM approach has considerable merits in terms of price data fitting and forecasting metrics. Our proposed framework driven by a hidden Markov chain with a state memory-capturing mechanism provides a powerful alternative to support the pricing of contracts in the electricity markets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Change of reference probability measure; Commodity-derivatives valuation; Energy-price modelling; Finance; Poisson process; Statistical estimation,Costs; Electric industry; Finance; Markov chains; Risk management; Signal theory; Stochastic systems; Electricity spot price; Energy prices; Hidden Markov chains; Higher-order Markov chains; Market participants; Poisson process; Reference probability; Statistical estimation; Power markets; demand analysis; electricity; energy market; estimation method; financial system; Markov chain; numerical model; Poisson ratio; price dynamics; probability; statistical analysis; stochasticity; Alberta; Canada,Article
"Ma K., Wang C., Yang J., Hua C., Guan X.",Pricing mechanism with noncooperative game and revenue sharing contract in electricity market,2019,6.0,"In this paper, a pricing mechanism is proposed for the electricity supply chain, which is consisting of one generation company (GC), multiple consumers, and competing utility companies (UCs). The UC participates in electricity supply chain management by a revenue sharing contract (RSC). In the electricity supply chain, the electricity real-time balance has an important role in the stable operation of the power system. Therefore, we introduce the demand response into the electricity supply chain to match supply with demand under forecast errors. Hence, we formulate a noncooperative game to characterize the interactions among the multiple competing UCs, which set the retail prices to maximize their profits. Besides, the UCs select their preferred contractual terms offered by the GC to maximize its profits and coordinate the electricity supply chain simultaneously. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) are examined, and an iterative algorithm is developed to obtain the NE. Furthermore, we analyze the RSC that can coordinate the electricity supply chain and align the NE with the cooperative optimum under the RSC. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model and the influence of market demand disruptions on the profits of the UCs, GC, and supply chain. © 2013 IEEE.",Electricity supply chain; load forecast errors; noncooperative game; pricing mechanism; revenue sharing contract (RSC),Binary alloys; Commerce; Contracts; Costs; Electric load management; Electric power generation; Electric power plant loads; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Game theory; Industry; Iterative methods; Power markets; Profitability; Supply chains; Uranium compounds; Electricity supply; Games; Load forecast; Load forecasting; Noncooperative game; Pricing mechanism; Revenue sharing contracts; Supply chain management,Article

"Osório G.J., Lotfi M., Shafie-khah M., Campos V.M.A., Catalão J.P.S.",Hybrid forecasting model for short-term electricity market prices with renewable integration,2018,6.0,"In recent years, there have been notable commitments and obligations by the electricity sector for more sustainable generation and delivery processes to reduce the environmental footprint. However, there is still a long way to go to achieve necessary sustainability goals while ensuring standards of robustness and the quality of power grids. One of the main challenges hindering this progress are uncertainties and stochasticity associated with the electricity sector and especially renewable generation. In this paradigm shift, forecasting tools are indispensable, and their utilization can significantly improve system operation and minimize costs associated with all related activities. Thus, forecasting tools have an essential key role in all decision-making stages. In this work, a hybrid probabilistic forecasting model (HPFM) was developed for short-term electricity market prices (EMP) combining wavelet transforms (WT), hybrid particle swarm optimization (DEEPSO), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The proposed hybrid probabilistic forecasting model (HPFM) was tested and validated with real data from the Spanish and Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) markets. The proposed model exhibited favorable results and performance in comparison with previously published work considering electricity market prices (EMP) data, which is notable. © 2018 by the authors.",Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Electricity market prices; Forecasting; Monte Carlo simulation; Particle swarm optimization; Probabilistic,decision making; electricity; energy market; environmental impact; forecasting method; fuzzy mathematics; model; Monte Carlo analysis; optimization; probability; simulation; stochasticity; sustainability; uncertainty analysis; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; United States,Article
"Hashmi M.U., Muthirayan D., Bušić A.",Effect of real-Time electricity pricing on ancillary service requirements,2018,6.0,"The objective of this work is to analyze the effect of real time electricity price (RTP) on the amount of ancillary services required for load balancing in presence of responsive users, information asymmetry and forecast errors in demand and renewable energy sources (RES) generation. We consider a RTP that is determined by the forecasted generation and ramping cost. A community choice aggregator manages the load of all the consumers by setting the price. The consumer’s objective is to minimize their overall cost of consumption. Ancillary services are called upon to balance the load in real time. With zero RES in the power network and a high degree of load flexibility, the proposed RTP flattens and the volatility in demand vanishes. However, in presence of RES the volatility in price and demand is reduced up to an extent and ancillary services are required for load balancing. The amount of ancillary services required increases with forecast errors. We also propose a real time algorithm that approximates the optimal consumer behavior under the complete information setting. Extensive numerical simulations are provided using real data from Pecan Street and Elia Belgium. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Ancillary service; Information asymmetry; Real time price design,Consumer behavior; Costs; Forecasting; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Ancillary service; Complete information; Electricity pricing; Information asymmetry; Real time algorithms; Real-time electricity prices; Real-time price; Renewable energy source; Smart power grids,Conference Paper
"Marín J.B., Orozco E.T., Velilla E.","Forecasting electricity price in Colombia: A comparison between neural network, ARMA process and hybrid models",2018,6.0,"This study aims to predict electricity prices in the Colombian electricity market. To achieve this goal, conventional time series econometrics analysis and one alternative technique based on artificial intelligence algorithms have been implemented. We use autoregressive-moving-average models (ARMAX) and non-linear autoregressive neural networks (NARX). After estimating a hybrid model that combines ARMAX and ARNX models, including exogenous inputs, we forecasted an electricity price time series in a horizon of 12 months ahead (May, 2017). Results show that NARX model’s performance is not significantly better than ARMAX’s. After applying a Diebold-Mariano test for forecasting accuracy, the null hypothesis is not rejected. This suggests no significant difference in predictive accuracy between the competing methodologies. © 2018, Econjournals.

"Guo W., Zhao Z.",A novel hybrid BND-FOA-LSSVM model for electricity price forecasting,2017,6.0,"Accurate electricity price forecasting plays an important role in the profits of electricity market participants and the healthy development of electricity market. However, the electricity price time series hold the characteristics of volatility and randomness, which make it quite hard to forecast electricity price accurately. In this paper, a novel hybrid model for electricity price forecasting was proposed combining Beveridge-Nelson decomposition (BND) method, fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) model, namely BND-FOA-LSSVM model. Firstly, the original electricity price time series were decomposed into deterministic term, periodic term, and stochastic term by using BND model. Then, these three decomposed terms were forecasted by employing LSSVM model, respectively. Meanwhile, to improve the forecasting performance, a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm FOA was used to automatically determine the optimal parameters of LSSVM model for deterministic term forecasting, periodic term forecasting, and stochastic term forecasting. Finally, the forecasting result of electricity price can be obtained by multiplying the forecasting values of these three terms. The results show the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the proposed BND-FOA-LSSVM model are respectively 3.48%, 11.18 Yuan/MWh and 9.95 Yuan/MWh, which are much smaller than that of LSSVM, BND-LSSVM, FOA-LSSVM, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-FOA-LSSVM models. The proposed BND-FOA-LSSVM model is effective and practical for electricity price forecasting, which can improve the electricity price forecasting accuracy. © 2017 by the authors.",Beveridge-Nelson decomposition method (BND); Electricity price forecasting; Fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA); Intelligence forecasting; Least square support vectormachine (LSSVM),Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Errors; Forecasting; Fruits; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Optimization; Signal processing; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Time series; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Decomposition methods; Electricity price forecasting; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA); Least square support vector machines; Mean absolute percentage error; Swarm intelligence optimization algorithm; Power markets,Article

"Smolen J., Dudic B.",The role of residual demand in electricity price analysis and forecasting: Case of Czech electricity market,2017,6.0,"Most of scientific papers dealing with power price predictions base their work on various statistical time series models. In this paper we propose a new, purely fundamental, approach to the issues of electricity price analysis and forecasting. While precise replication of real power market processes is very complicated, we show that even relatively simple fundamental model is able to explain large part of price movements on the electricity markets. Analysis presented is based predominantly on the merit order theory and introduces the concept of residual demand as a crucial variable for explaining hourly electricity price movements. While the analysis shown in this paper is applied to the Czech Electricity day-ahead market, it can be well replicated also for the other relevant European power market areas. Tests of fundamental approaches towards power price forecasting have shown very promising results and we believe they deserve more attention from the electricity market researchers. © 2017, Econjournals.

It has many applications such as future maintenance scheduling of the power plants, risk management, plan future contracts, purchasing raw materials and determine the market pricing. To forecast the electricity price, some factors are very important, such as choosing the most useful price features that influence the market price, and choosing the proper prediction model that is able to predict the price variations behavior using the historical data.

"Anamika, Kumar N.",Market Clearing Price prediction using ANN in Indian Electricity Markets,2016,6.0,"The electricity industry is evolving into a distributed and competitive in which market forces drive the price of the electricity and reduce the net cost through increased competition. Forecasting system Market Clearing Volume (MCV) and Market Clearing Price (MCP) has become even more important in order to make optimal bidding and profit maximization. This research work presents Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based forecasting model to estimate future Market Clearing Prices in Indian Electricity Markets. The model is verified by comparing the results of ANN with Regression model. The performance of the ANN and Regression models are evaluated on the data available on Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) site for the period January 2013 to March 2014. This paper forecasts the daily MCPs for the months of January, February and March for the year 2014. It is found that the forecasted MCPs in the Indian Electricity Markets have the less agreement with the ANN model and appropriate agreement with the Regression model. Consequently, it confirms about the unreliability and highly sensitiveness of ANN with respect to regression model. The Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPEs) are evaluated to check the robustness of the two proposed methodologies. © 2016 IEEE.",Artificial Neural Networks; Electricity Markets; forecasting; Market Clearing Price; Market Clearing Volume; Regression model,Competition; Costs; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Electricity industry; Forecasting modeling; Market clearing; Market Clearing Price; Market clearing prices; Market-clearing price prediction; Mean absolute percentage error; Regression model; Commerce,Conference Paper

The unique features of electricity price, such as non-stationary, non-linearity and high volatility make this a very difficult task. For this reason, rather than a simple point forecast, market participants are more interested in a probabilistic forecast that is essential to estimate the uncertainty involved in the price. By focusing on this issue, the aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of external factors in the electricity price and present a methodology for probabilistic forecasting of day-ahead electricity prices from the Iberian electricity market.

"Alonso A.M., Bastos G., García-Martos C.",Electricity price forecasting by averaging dynamic factor models,2016,6.0,"In the context of the liberalization of electricity markets, forecasting prices is essential. With this aim, research has evolved to model the particularities of electricity prices. In particular, dynamic factor models have been quite successful in the task, both in the short and long run. However, specifying a single model for the unobserved factors is difficult, and it cannot be guaranteed that such a model exists. In this paper, model averaging is employed to overcome this difficulty, with the expectation that electricity prices would be better forecast by a combination of models for the factors than by a single model. Although our procedure is applicable in other markets, it is illustrated with an application to forecasting spot prices of the Iberian Market, MIBEL (The Iberian Electricity Market). Three combinations of forecasts are successful in providing improved results for alternative forecasting horizons. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Bayesian model averaging; Dimensionality reduction; Electricity prices; Forecast combination,Bayesian networks; Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Bayesian model averaging; Dimensionality reduction; Dynamic factor models; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecast combinations; Iberian electricity market; Model averaging; Power markets,Article
"Severini M., Squartini S., Fagiani M., Piazza F.",Energy management with the support of dynamic pricing strategies in real micro-grid scenarios,2015,6.0,"Although smart grids are regarded as the technology to overcome the limits of nowadays power distribution grids, the transition will require much time. Dynamic pricing, a straightforward implementation of demand response, may provide the means to manipulate the grid load thus extending the life expectancy of current technology. However, to integrate a dynamic pricing scheme in the crowded pool of technologies, available at demand side, a proper energy manager with the support of a pricing profile forecaster is mandatory. Although energy management and price forecasting are recurrent topics, in literature they have been addressed separately. On the other hand, in this work, the aim is to investigate how well an energy manager is able to perform in presence of data uncertainty originating from the forecasting process. On purpose, an energy and resource manager has been revised and extended in the current manuscript. Finally, it has been complemented with a price forecasting technique, based on the Extreme Learning Machine paradigm. The proposed forecaster has proven to be better performing and more robust, with respect to the most common forecasting approaches. The energy manager, as well, has proven that the energy efficiency of the residential environment can be improved significantly. Nonetheless, to achieve the theoretical optimum, forecasting techniques tailored for that purpose may be required. © 2015 IEEE.",Dynamic Price Forecasting; Energy Management; Extreme Learning Machine; Mixed-Integer Linear Programming; Neural Networks; Smart Micro Grid,Costs; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Forecasting; Houses; Integer programming; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Managers; Neural networks; Power markets; Current technology; Dynamic price; Extreme learning machine; Forecasting techniques; Mixed integer linear programming; Power distribution grids; Residential environment; Smart Micro Grids; Smart power grids,Conference Paper
Kim M.-K.,A new approach to short-term price forecast strategy with an artificial neural network approach: Application to the Nord Pool,2015,6.0,"In new deregulated electricity market, short-term price forecasting is key information for all market players. A better forecast of market-clearing price (MCP) helps market participants to strategically set up their bidding strategies for energy markets in the short-term. This paper presents a new prediction strategy to improve the need for more accurate short-term price forecasting tool at spot market using an artificial neural networks (ANNs). To build the forecasting ANN model, a threelayered feedforward neural network trained by the improved Levenberg-marquardt (LM) algorithm is used to forecast the locational marginal prices (LMPs). To accurately predict LMPs, actual power generation and load are considered as the input sets, and then the difference is used to predict price differences in the spot market. The proposed ANN model generalizes the relationship between the LMP in each area and the unconstrained MCP during the same period of time. The LMP calculation is iterated so that the capacity between the areas is maximized and the mechanism itself helps to relieve grid congestion. The addition of flow between the areas gives the LMPs a new equilibrium point, which is balanced when taking the transfer capacity into account, LMP forecasting is then possible. The proposed forecasting strategy is tested on the spot market of the Nord Pool. The validity, the efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed approach are shown by comparing with time-series models. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.",Artificial neural network; Levenberg-marquardt algorithm; Locational marginal price; Nord pool; Short-term forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Feedforward neural networks; Lakes; Neural networks; Power markets; Artificial neural network approach; Deregulated electricity market; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Locational marginal prices; Nord pool; Short-term forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Three-layered feedforward neural networks; Forecasting,Article

"Shrivastava N.A., Khosravi A., Panigrahi B.K.",Prediction interval estimation for electricity price and demand using support vector machines,2014,6.0,"Uncertainty is known to be a concomitant factor of almost all the real world commodities such as oil prices, stock prices, sales and demand of products. As a consequence, forecasting problems are becoming more and more challenging and ridden with uncertainty. Such uncertainties are generally quantified by statistical tools such as prediction intervals (Pis). Pis quantify the uncertainty related to forecasts by estimating the ranges of the targeted quantities. Pis generated by traditional neural network based approaches are limited by high computational burden and impractical assumptions about the distribution of the data. A novel technique for constructing high quality Pis using support vector machines (SVMs) is being proposed in this paper. The proposed technique directly estimates the upper and lower bounds of the PI in a short time and without any assumptions about the data distribution. The SVM parameters are tuned using particle swarm optimization technique by minimization of a modified Pi-based objective function. Electricity price and demand data of the Ontario electricity market is used to validate the performance of the proposed technique. Several case studies for different months indicate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of high quality PI generation and shorter computational times. © 2014 IEEE.",Deregulation; Particle swarm optimization; Prediction interval; Support vector machines; Uncertainty,Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Statistical mechanics; Uncertainty analysis; Computational burden; Network-based approach; Ontario electricity markets; Particle swarm optimization technique; Prediction interval; Support vector machine (SVMs); Uncertainty; Upper and lower bounds; Support vector machines,Conference Paper

This paper presents the impact of the liberalization process in the Spanish electricity market and the impact of RES-E on household electricity prices.However, as the electricity market liberalization is relatively recent, the related data is limited, and even when trying to estimate the electricity price models through regression procedures a dimensionality problem presents itself. Therefore, in this paper a Maximum Entropy Econometric approach is used that allows for the estimation of models when information is limited.

"Bandyopadhayay A., Roy S., Ghosh D.",Forecasting day-ahead price of electricity - A dynamic regression approach,2013,6.0,"The electricity market is being deregulated all over the world. Deregulation has brought in a variety of trading systems such as day-ahead trading and has also introduced high volatility of electricity prices. The large variability of price increases the risk for the market participants and forces the business houses to look for a forecasting accuracy of about ± 3%. This paper provides a method to predict next-day electricity prices using dynamic regression methodology where the price was regressed on selected demand, as well as supply side variables available in the public domain, and the error has been modelled using ARIMA / SARIMA models. The results were found to be very encouraging with MAPE lying in the range of ± 3.5% in most cases. In order to reduce the complexity associated with developing many models, a clustering methodology was used to group the different hours of the day so as to reduce the number of forecasting models to be fitted. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with single linkage was used and models for representative hours had the required level of accuracy.

"Materassi D., Roozbehani M., Dahleh M.A.",Equilibrium price distributions in energy markets with shiftable demand,2012,6.0,"The paper examines existence of equilibrium price distributions in energy markets with real-time pricing and consumers with time-flexible demands. Previous works have examined consumer optimal policies for shifting time-flexible loads up to a deadline, in response to an exogenous and stochastic price process. It is shown here that under some mild assumptions on the stochastic price process and the information structure in the market, the individual consumer's optimal policy is a threshold policy. The threshold policy indicates that a consumer will consume only when the price falls below a certain threshold which depends on the time left to his deadline and the information on the price process. This behavior by individual consumer leads to an aggregate behavior by a large number of consumers who implement threshold policies in reaction to the price process; although at each instant of time, different consumers may have different thresholds due to different deadlines and different information assumptions. The aggregate response from the consumers determines the state of the wholesale market, and thus, affects the price process. The question that we intend to answer in this paper is that of consistency of assumptions on the price process and the market outcomes. It is assumed that the price at each time interval is determined by the Independent Service Operator (ISO) on the basis of an estimate of the global consumption as a function of price. It is shown that under technical regularity assumptions on the model components, the price distribution has at least one equilibrium point. Thus, there exists at least one price process that is consistent both with the consumption behavior of the aggregate of consumers who individually implement threshold policies, and the marginal cost pricing mechanism of the ISO. © 2012 IEEE.",,Aggregate behavior; Energy markets; Equilibrium point; Equilibrium price; Global consumption; Information structures; Marginal-cost pricing; Market outcomes; Model components; Optimal policies; Price process; Real time pricing; Regularity assumption; Threshold policies; Time interval; Wholesale markets; Aggregates; Commerce; Costs; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Consumer behavior,Conference Paper
"Nikogosian V., Veith T.",The impact of ownership on price-setting in retail-energy markets-The German case,2012,6.0,"This paper analyzes whether public ownership has an impact on providers' price-setting. Under the assumption of more efficient energy provision which benefits customers a large number of former energy monopolists have been privatized in line with the liberalization of energy markets in Germany at the end of the 1990s. However, current re-municipalizations are justified by similar arguments in the public debate. Based on a dataset on the ownership structure of energy providers we find that public property or private property itself is not the decisive factor for lower retail and wholesale prices. Rather, a high ownership concentration leads to low prices, regardless of the type of owner. As public investors often seek total ownership of a provider, households, which are less willing to switch, benefit at least indirectly from public ownership. Tests for robustness of our results applying different owner and concentration measures confirm the results independently from the underlying estimation specification. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Ownership structure; Strategic price-setting; Vertical ownership relation,Concentration measures; Data sets; Energy markets; Germany; In-line; Ownership structure; Price setting; Private property; Public debate; Public investors; Public ownership; Strategic price-setting; Vertical ownership relation; Whole sale prices; Privatization; Sales; Costs; energy efficiency; energy market; liberalization; ownership; price determination; public sector; retailing; Germany,Article

Therefore, prices processes are modelled using ARFIMA-FIGARCH under Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions. Such models are sufficiently flexible to handle the long memory phenomena often encountered in both conditional mean and conditional variance in electricity spot prices. Forecasting is subsequently performed on the basis of adequate models.

"Webber G., Warrington J., Mariéthoz S., Morari M.",Communication limitations in iterative real time pricing for power systems,2011,6.0,"Iterative, or negotiated, pricing mechanisms have been of interest for decades as a systematic means of operating electricity markets, and have more recently been proposed as a way of dealing with the increased diversity of responsive market participants brought about by smart grid technologies and the increasing share of intermittent energy sources. One possibility is for the market coordinator to communicate iteratively with market participants to determine energy prices, on a receding horizon basis. Until now, little work has been carried out on the practicalities of implementing such pricing mechanisms, and yet because a market outcome must be cleared in real time, adequate communication speed and reliability is essential. The authors present a model of lossy and delayed communication over a network for such a negotiated pricing mechanism, derived from practical consideration of message timing, collection strategies and security. The convergence of the algorithm to an optimal dispatch is shown to be quite robust to frequent communication failures and delays. Results are demonstrated for price negotiation over a 20-step time horizon on a densely-populated IEEE 39 bus network. © 2011 IEEE.",communication limits; IEEE 39 bus; iterative pricing; network model; nodal pricing; predictive control; receding horizon; smart grids; TCP/IP,network model; Nodal pricing; Predictive control; Receding horizon; Smart grid; TCP/IP; Commerce; Communication; Costs; Real time systems; Smart power grids,Conference Paper
"Cardell J., Anderson L., Tee C.Y.",The effect of wind and demand uncertainty on electricity prices and system performance,2010,6.0,"The uncertainty in wind power forecasts often results in forecast errors that require system operators to redispatch a power system in real time, once the actual wind generation is known. This paper analyzes the financial impact of this uncertainty in terms of the costs of redispatch. The analysis uses an optimal power flow (OPF) model in a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) framework to estimate these cost impacts as the difference in production cost and system lambda from a base case dispatch. Using a range of wind generation, reserve margins and assumptions for the ramp capability of non-wind generators, the results from the OPF and MCS show that wind power forecast uncertainty combined with load uncertainty can increase the variability in production cost for situations where moderate wind and load are expected, and will increase the variability in system lambda for the situation where low wind output and high load are expected. The results also show that on average there are few voltage violations. © 2010 IEEE.",Electricity markets; Interruptible load; Monte Carlo Simulation; Wind power generation,Cost impact; Demand uncertainty; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Financial impacts; Forecast errors; High load; Interruptible load; Load uncertainty; Monte Carlo Simulation; Optimal power flows; Power systems; Production cost; Real time; Redispatch; System operator; Voltage violation; Wind generation; Wind generators; Wind power forecast; Computer simulation; Cosmic ray detectors; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Monte Carlo methods; Ramp generators; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper

"Mazengia D.H., Tuan L.A.",Forecasting spot electricity market prices using time series models,2008,6.0,This paper addresses the importance of electricity price forecasting in the deregulated electricity market. A simple multiple linear regression approach is proposed to predict next day's electricity prices. The developed models are tested using time-series data of the Nordic electricity market (Nord Pool) and a Canadian electricity market (Ontario) and satisfactory results are achieved. The obtained results of the Nord Pool market are found to be relatively more accurate than those of the Ontario market. This arises from the fact that the market of Ontario is very volatile and its market prices are hardly predictable. The results of the study have shown that the proposed models perform very well with the markets with rather low levels of volatility. ©2008 IEEE.,,Costs; Deregulation; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Energy conservation; Time series; Deregulated electricity markets; Developed models; Electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Low levels; Market prices; Multiple linear regression approaches; Ontario; Pool markets; Spot electricity markets; Time-series datum; Time-series models; Marketing,Conference Paper
"Wang B., Zhang S., Xue Q., Shen P.",Prediction of power system marginal price based on chaos characteristics,2008,6.0,"System marginal price is the unified price of reflecting the short-term supply and demand relation of electric commodity in the electricity market. Confirming the system marginal price is the lever and core content of electricity market. At present, how to predict the system marginal price efficiently is one of the focus problems in the research of electricity market application. In the electricity market, system marginal price is not a parameter that varies according to normal rules. It not only has relations to load curve, available generation capacity, bidding mode, system and unit of the generation companies, but also is in reference to price of commodities, inflation and so on. As we can not use mathematic mode to express the diversity and randomicity of factors which reflects electricity price, it is difficult to predict electricity price accurately. In recent years, as the chaotic theory develops, especially speaking, applying chaotic theory to load forecasting offers a new tool to study the stochastic evolution of electricity price. Furthermore, people reveal the regularity that the evolution of both electricity price time series and load time series indicates the chaotic nature, which hiding in these time series themselves. It offers foundation for predicting electricity price by using phase space reconstruction. This paper analyzes the basic character of the system marginal price time series in greater depth. Then, according to the theory of phase space reconstruction, it makes use of the time series of electricity price data, adopts adding weight one-rank local region method, does not consider the stochastic factor related to electricity price, directly analyzes historical data of the electricity price that contains all factors, and carries on forestation based on acquired objective regularity. We carry on the prediction on the historical data from California electricity market, analyze and draw a detailed comparison with existing forecasting methods such as BP algorithm and LS-VSM algorithm, which shows that mean absolute percentage error reduce 22.6% and 12.8% respectively. Therefore, this method can acquire a better forecasting result. ©2008 IEEE.",Adding weight one-rank local region method; Chaos; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; System marginal price,Backpropagation algorithms; Boolean functions; Chaotic systems; Competition; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Electric power systems; Electricity; Forecasting; Marketing; Phase space methods; Restoration; Stochastic programming; Technology transfer; Time series analysis; Adding weight one-rank local region method; Chaos; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; System marginal price; Electric network analysis,Conference Paper
"Amjady N., Daraeepour A.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using the relief algorithm and neural networks,2008,6.0,"In a competitive electricity market, forecast of energy prices is a key information for the market participants. However, price signal usually has a complex behavior due to its nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variancy. In spite of all performed researches on this area in the recent years, there is still an essential need for more accurate and robust price forecast methods. In this paper, a combination of a feature selection technique and Neural Network (NN) is proposed for this purpose. The feature selection method is a modified version of the Relief algorithm, proposed for the feature selection of price forecasting. Then, by means of the most relevant, explanatory and irredundant features, a Neural Network (NN) predicts the next values of the price signal. The adjustable parameters of the whole method are fine-tuned by a cross-validation technique. The proposed method is examined on PJM electricity market, forecasting day-ahead locational marginal prices (LMPs), and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods especially some other popular and validated feature selection techniques.

"Kim B., Velas J.P., Lee J., Park J., Shin J., Lee K.Y.",Short-term system marginal price forecasting using system-type neural network architecture,2006,6.0,"Neural networks have been applied in various new ways to the problem of short-term load and electricity price forecasting for power systems. Virtually all of these methods are based on using statistical patterns, which are perceived between the yearly load and system marginal price (SMP) histories of the system to predict the forecasted year's power demand and SMP. The SMP forecasting is a very important element in an electricity market for the optimal biddings of market participants as well as for market stabilization of regulatory bodies. The proposed method introduces a system type neural network architecture to perform electricity price forecasting. Specifically, the proposed approach begins with the premise that the electricity price for a given year can be given a structure which can then be related to the structure of the reference year, in such a way that a transformation can be found from the reference year's structure to the forecasting year's structure. The transformation depends upon how parameters, which influenced the SMP but can not be measured, move from the reference year to the forecasting year. © 2006 IEEE.",,Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Market participants; Optimal bidding; Power demands; Regulatory bodies; Statistical pattern; System marginal price; Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Forecasting; Network architecture; Neural networks; Power transmission; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper

"Benaouda D., Murtagh F.",Hybrid wavelet model for electricity pool-price forecasting in a deregulated electricity market,2006,6.0,"Electricity supply industry is in the process of deregulation in many countries including Australia. The purpose of deregulation is to give consumers free choices of their electricity supply. Thus, accurate electricity pool price forecasting can provide a set of vital predicted information that helps generation, transmission and retailer participating companies to bid strategically into a deregulated electricity market in order to maximize their profits. In this article, we propose a wavelet multiscale decomposition based autoregressive approach for the prediction of one-hour ahead and one-day ahead pool price based on historical electricity pool price and predicted electricity load data. This approach is based on a multiple resolution decomposition of the signal using the non-decimated or redundant Haar à trous wavelet transform whose advantage is taking into account the asymmetric nature of the time-varying data. There is an additional computational advantage in that there is no need to re-compute the wavelet transform (wavelet coefficients) of the full signal if the electricity pool price data (time series) is regularly updated. We assess results produced by this multiscale autoregressive (MAR) method, in both linear and non-linear variants, with single resolution autoregressive (AR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. Experimental results are based on the New South Wales (Australia) electricity load and pool price data that is provided by the National Electricity Market Management Company (NEMMCO). © 2006 IEEE.",Autoregression; Multi-layer perceptron; Resolution scale; Time-series; Wavelet transform,Energy policy; Marketing; Multilayer neural networks; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Wavelet transforms; Autoregression; Electricity markets; Hybrid wavelet models; Resolution scales; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper

"Qiaolin D., Jing T., Jianxin L.",Application of new FCMAC neural network in power system marginal price forecasting,2005,6.0,"In the electric power market, power system marginal price forecasting is the basis for power companies to build their optimal bidding strategies. Price forecasting is a new research area, because power market is still in the rudimentary stage in China. Due to its attractive properties of learning convergence and speed, many practical areas have widely put it into use including power system marginal price forecasting area. The method of neural network is good at its learning capability but lack of clear internal knowledge expression. The beginning of study is limited to random initial conditions, which may lead to low convergence speed and even local extremum. Necessary initial experience and knowledge cannot be fully made use of. While fuzzy logic method is good at approximate and qualitative knowledge expression but lack of learning capability. Membership function and fuzzy rules can only be selected by experience and tries. Besides, the study and adjustment of parameters and weigh is rather difficult. Thus, the proper combination of the above methods is a breakthrough in effective system control. This paper establishes a short-term forecasting model of power system marginal price using the method of Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller Neural Network, and applies it to power market in real province for training and examining. FCMAC method is proved to be superior to former methods, for its low need of training samples, its stable outputs, its high forecasted speed and accuracy.

"Mount T., Oh H.",On the first price spike in summer,2004,6.0,"The objective of this paper is to determine why price spikes occur in deregulated wholesale markes for electricity, and how effectively they can be mitigated by different modifications to the market.. The analysis employs a multi-agent system (MAS) to replicate a spot market with six supply firms, represented by adaptive autonomous agents,. These firms submit offers to maximize their own expected profits, and an Independent System Operator (ISO) clears the market for a predetermined load in a uniform price auction. The firms learn about the market and the behavior of their competitors by comparing actual market outcomes with predicted outcomes based on an estimate of their own residual demand curve. This estimated demand curve is updated each period using a Kalman filter. The main results for creating price spikes are 1) uncertainty about the system load is an important determinant of observed behavior (i.e. offer curves shaped like a hockey stick) that is replicated in the MAS, and 2) all firms eventually become speculators, and it is unrealistic to expect firms to behave like price takers in a market with six suppliers. The main results for mitigating high prices are 1) it is impractical to rely on more suppliers, vertically integrated firms, capacity payments or fixed contracts for power to eliminate speculative behavior, and 2) price responsive load is an effective way to mitigate high prices, particularly if some load responds at relatively low prices. Overall, the results show that a MAS can be used to evaluate a wide range of policy options and supplement the results of market tests using human subjects.",,Automatic mitigation procedures (AMP); Electricity markets; Independent system operators (ISO); Litigation; Computer simulation; Costs; Deregulation; Electric loads; Estimation; Industrial economics; Kalman filtering; Multi agent systems,Conference Paper

Considering all the potent factors in determining the electricity prices - some of which have stochastic nature - makes this a cumbersome task. In this article, first, Grey correlation analysis is applied to select the effective parameters in EPF problem and eliminate redundant factors based on low correlation grades. Then, a deep neural network with stacked denoising auto-encoders has been utilized to denoise data sets from different sources individually. After that, to detect the main features of the input data and putting aside the unnecessary features, dimension reduction process is implemented. Finally, the rough structure artificial neural network (ANN) has been executed to forecast the day-ahead electricity price. The proposed method is implemented on the data of Ontario, Canada, and the forecasted results are compared with different structures of ANN, support vector machine, long short-term memory - benchmarking methods in this field - and forecasting data reported by independent electricity system operator (IESO) to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

"Windler T., Busse J., Rieck J.",One month-ahead electricity price forecasting in the context of production planning,2019,5.0,"One month-ahead electricity prices open up a great potential for manufacturing companies that aim at reducing energy costs. On the machine level, an energy cost-oriented scheduling can be realized through determining the least electricity cost-intensive launch times for job processing during a day.

In this paper, we apply a Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN) approach, a TBATS approach, and a Deep Feedforward Neural Network (DFNN) approach to forecast EPEX Spot day-ahead electricity prices of the European Energy Exchange in Germany/Austria, while accounting for a forecast horizon of up to one month. Model performances are compared by means of established error measures as well as by adjusted error measures to better interpret results from a production planner's point of view. For evaluation purposes, 1357 different forecasts were computed for each of the methods, allowing valid conclusions as to their performance.

In this paper, we wish to reassess the chaotic paradigm in the light of two new pieces of information with respect to the literature: the appearance of noise-aware estimation methods for the correlation entropy and the availability of longer time series. Our analysis shows that the literature has heavily underestimated the presence of noise, and that chaotic characteristics coexist with stochastic ones in the time series of prices. Through the recurrence quantification analysis, we have also observed the presence of intermittency, where periods of regular behaviour are replaced by periods of chaotic behaviour, which could explain the emergence of bubbles. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Chaos; Crude oil; Energy commodities; Entropy; Futures; Heating oil; Natural gas,Chaos theory; Costs; Crude oil; Entropy; Natural gas; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Time series; Time series analysis; Chaotic behaviour; Chaotic characteristics; Energy commodity; Estimation methods; Futures; Heating oil; Intermittency; Recurrence quantification analysis; Financial markets; commodity price; crude oil; energy market; entropy; estimation method; future prospect; natural gas; stochasticity; time series analysis,Article

The results confirm the merit order effects detected in the existing literature, both for photovoltaics and wind power, more strongly in market conditions characterised by moderately low price levels and with some implied increase in volatility. The new cable has apparently challenged the ability of power generating companies to extract value through price spikes, has mitigated volatility, and its effects have been complementary with those of renewables. Effects from photovoltaics are more sensitive to robustness checks.

"Ng W.W.Y., Zhang J., Lai C.S., Pedrycz W., Lai L.L., Wang X.",Cost-sensitive weighting and imbalance-reversed bagging for streaming imbalanced and concept drifting in electricity pricing classification,2019,5.0,"In data streaming environments such as a smart grid, it is impossible to restrict each data chunk to have the same number of samples in each class. Hence, in addition to the concept drift, classification problems in streaming data environments are inherently imbalanced. However, streaming imbalanced and concept drifting problems in the power system and smart grid have rarely been studied. Incremental learning aims to learn the correct classification for the future unseen samples from the given streaming data. In this paper, we propose a new incremental ensemble learning method to handle both concept drift and class imbalance issues. The class imbalance issue is tackled by an imbalance-reversed bagging method that improves the true positive rate while maintains a low false positive rate. The adaptation to concept drift is achieved by a dynamic cost-sensitive weighting scheme for component classifiers according to their classification performances and stochastic sensitivities. The proposed method is applied to a case study for the electricity pricing in Australia to predict whether the price of New South Wales will be higher or lower than that of Victorias in a 24-h period. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with statistical significance in comparison to the state-of-the-art incremental learning methods. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity pricing; imbalanced classification; incremental Learning,Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Learning systems; Personnel training; Power markets; Bagging; Electricity pricing; Imbalanced classification; Incremental learning; Sensitivity; Smart grid; Smart power grids,Article
"Quint D., Dahlke S.",The impact of wind generation on wholesale electricity market prices in the midcontinent independent system operator energy market: An empirical investigation,2019,5.0,"The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) is the second largest organized competitive wholesale electricity market in the U.S. Wholesale electricity prices in MISO have decreased over the past several years, as both natural gas prices have fallen, and large amounts of wind generation capacity have been added. Using an empirical econometric approach studying historical hourly real-time electricity prices, load, natural gas prices, and other MISO market data, a series of econometric models are estimated using historical data from 2008 to 2016, to identify the impact of increased wind generation on wholesale electricity prices in MISO. This is the first such empiric study for MISO, the largest wholesale electricity market by geography in the world. Furthermore, this is the first empiric study estimating impacts of wind generation on electricity price that utilizes a comprehensive set of predictor variables to control for many sources of potential bias. The results show a statistically significant impact of wind generation on real-time hourly MISO system prices, ranging from an estimated decrease of $0.14 to $0.34 per mega-watt hour, for each 100 mega-watt hours of additional wind generation. It is observed that the estimated marginal impacts of additional wind generation have declined over time. This is likely attributable to the long-term shifts in the supply and demand dynamics experienced in the MISO energy market, as well as to changes made to the MISO market structure to better accommodate variable generation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Energy economics; Wind energy,Costs; Electric industry; Natural gas; Power markets; Wind power; Electricity prices; Empirical investigation; Energy economics; Independent system operators; Predictor variables; Variable generations; Wholesale electricity; Wholesale electricity markets; Electric power generation; econometrics; electricity; empirical analysis; energy market; historical record; natural gas; power generation; price dynamics; resource economy; wind power; United States,Article
"Afanasyev D.O., Fedorova E.A.",On the impact of outlier filtering on the electricity price forecasting accuracy,2019,5.0,"Increasing the accuracy of short-term electricity price forecasting allows day-ahead power market participants to obtain a positive economic effect by bidding close to the equilibrium price. However the electricity price time-series is generally infested with extreme values due to high price volatility. This paper discusses the impact of outlier filtering on forecasting accuracy based on a recently introduced seasonal component autoregressive model. We consider such methods of outlier detection (with a priori defined cut-off parameter) as threshold, standard deviation, percentage, recursive, and moving filter on prices. It is shown that such data pre-processing often leads to the forecasting accuracy gain while the error decrease (relative to the approach without filtering) in a number of cases may reach 1.8–1.9% of the average weekly price (in absolute values). For an a priori defined cut-off parameter, the simple threshold and standard deviation filter on prices outperform other considered methods, and yield to the accuracy gain in 63% and 67% of cases, correspondingly. At the same time, in case of the out-of-sample filter parameter grid-optimization all of the methods demonstrate comparable prediction power (equal to the marginal performance). But, practically speaking, such optimization is time-consuming and cannot be carried out on unavailable future data. As an competitive alternative, we propose a combined filter on prices based on a committee machine which uses the results of individual non-optimized algorithms and is not time-consuming, but gives accuracy comparable to the best one obtained for each of the studied electricity markets and leads to forecast gain in 63% of the considered cases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Committee machine; Electricity price forecasting; Long-term trend-seasonal component; Model confidence set; Outlier filtering,Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Forecasting; Statistics; Auto regressive models; Committee machines; Day-ahead power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Long-term trend; Optimized algorithms; Standard deviation; Power markets; accuracy assessment; algorithm; economic conditions; electricity; energy market; optimization; price determination,Article
"Serafin T., Uniejewski B., Weron R.",Averaging predictive distributions across calibration windows for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2019,5.0,"The recent developments in combining point forecasts of day-ahead electricity prices across calibration windows have provided an extremely simple, yet a very efficient tool for improving predictive accuracy. Here, we consider two novel extensions of this concept to probabilistic forecasting: one based on Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) applied to a set of point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows, the other on a technique dubbed Quantile Regression Machine (QRM), which first averages these point predictions, then applies quantile regression to the combined forecast. Once computed, we combine the probabilistic forecasts across calibration windows by averaging probabilities of the corresponding predictive distributions. Our results show that QRM is not only computationally more efficient, but also yields significantly more accurate distributional predictions, as measured by the aggregate pinball score and the test of conditional predictive ability. Moreover, combining probabilistic forecasts brings further significant accuracy gains. c 2019 by the authors.",Autoregression; Average probability forecast; Calibration window; Combining forecasts; Conditional predictive ability; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive distribution,Calibration; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Regression analysis; Autoregression; Combining forecasts; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive abilities; Predictive distributions; Probability forecasts; Power markets,Article
"Jiang L., Hu G.",Day-Ahead Price Forecasting for Electricity Market using Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network,2018,5.0,"In this paper, an efficient method for the day-ahead electricity price forecasting (EPF) is proposed based on a long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network model. LSTM network has been widely used in various applications such as natural language processing and time series analysis. It is capable of learning features and long term dependencies of the historical information on the current predictions for sequential data. We propose to use LSTM model to forecast the day-ahead electricity price for Australian market at Victoria (VIC) region and Singapore market. Instead of using only historical prices as inputs to the model, we also consider exogenous variables, such as holidays, day of the week, hour of the day, weather conditions, oil prices and historical price/demand, etc. The output is the electricity price for the next hour. The future 24 hours of prices are forecasted in a recursive manner. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of four weeks for each season in VIC and Singapore markets are examined. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using real market data from both markets. The result shows that the LSTM network outperforms four popular forecasting methods and provides up to 47.3% improvement in the average daily MAPE for the VIC market. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting (EPF); energy market; long-short term memory neural network; multiple steps,Brain; Commerce; Computer vision; Costs; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Robotics; Time series analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Energy markets; Historical information; Long-term dependencies; Mean absolute percentage error; multiple steps; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network model; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Ilseven E., Göl M.",Hydro-Optimization-Based Medium-Term Price Forecasting Considering Demand and Supply Uncertainty,2018,5.0,"This paper proposes an electricity market model of Turkish electricity market for monthly and yearly electricity price forecasting in medium-term by means of supply and demand dynamics formed via a theoretical approach. The electricity market model created within this scope consists of three main components related to electricity demand, supply, and price segments along with hydro optimization submodel, which takes into account the nonlinear relation between supply and price. Electricity price is determined based on the intersection of demand curve and merit order curve that has dynamic behavior for dam-type hydrogeneration, import coal, and natural gas power plants. The paper aims to determine the range of possible electricity prices rather than a single price forecast by creating multiple scenarios based on the uncertainties in main variables affecting the electricity prices. Meanwhile, electricity generation portfolio with respect to market participants and primary energy resources as well as price forecasts can be obtained simultaneously. Ultimately, the model can identify how effective a variable of the market on the electricity price is. The developed method is validated via real data. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Electricity market modeling; electricity price forecasting; optimization,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Optimization; Power generation; Uncertainty analysis; Demand forecasting; Electricity market model; Electricity price forecasting; Predictive models; Uncertainty; Power markets,Article
"Aminu N., Meenagh D., Minford P.",The role of energy prices in the Great Recession — A two-sector model with unfiltered data,2018,5.0,"We investigate the role of energy shocks during the Great Recession. We study the behaviour of the UK energy and non-energy intensive sectors firms in a real business cycle (RBC) model using unfiltered data. The model is econometrically estimated and tested by indirect inference. Output contraction during the Great Recession was largely caused by energy price and sector-specific productivity shocks, all of which are non-stationary and hence tend to dominate the sample variance decomposition. We also found that the channel by which the energy price shock reduces output in the model is via the terms of trade: these fall permanently when world energy prices increase and as substitutes for energy inputs are strictly limited there are few reactions via production channels. Therefore, there is no other way to balance the deteriorating current account than through lower domestic absorption. © 2018",Energy price shock; Great Recession; Output; Productivity shock; RBC; Unfiltered data,Productivity; Energy price shocks; Great Recession; Indirect inference; Output; Production channels; Specific productivity; Terms of trades; Unfiltered data; Costs; business cycle; data set; econometrics; energy market; price determination; productivity; United Kingdom,Article
"Giovanelli C., Sierla S., Ichise R., Vyatkin V.",Exploiting artificial neural networks for the prediction of ancillary energy market prices,2018,5.0,"The increase of distributed energy resources in the smart grid calls for new ways to profitably exploit these resources, which can participate in day-ahead ancillary energy markets by providing flexibility. Higher profits are available for resource owners that are able to anticipate price peaks and hours of low prices or zero prices, as well as to control the resource in such a way that exploits the price fluctuations. Thus, this study presents a solution in which artificial neural networks are exploited to predict the day-ahead ancillary energy market prices. The study employs the frequency containment reserve for the normal operations market as a case study and presents the methodology utilized for the prediction of the case study ancillary market prices. The relevant data sources for predicting the market prices are identified, then the frequency containment reserve market prices are analyzed and compared with the spot market prices. In addition, the methodology describes the choices behind the definition of the model validation method and the performance evaluation coefficient utilized in the study. Moreover, the empirical processes for designing an artificial neural network model are presented. The performance of the artificial neural network model is evaluated in detail by means of several experiments, showing robustness and adaptiveness to the fast-changing price behaviors. Finally, the developed artificial neural network model is shown to have better performance than two state of the art models, support vector regression and ARIMA, respectively. © 2018 by the authors.

"Tee J.E.C., Teo T.T., Logenthiran T., Woo W.L., Abidi K.",Day-ahead forecasting of wholesale electricity pricing using extreme learning machine,2017,5.0,"In a deregulated electricity market where consumers can prepare bidding plans and purchase electricity directly from supplies, consumers can expect the price to fluctuate based on the demand. The consumers can also make economic beneficial decision to use electricity when the price is low. In this context, accurate forecast of the electricity price enable the consumers to plan and make such decisions.

"Bustos-Salvagno J., Fuentes F.H.",Electricity interconnection in Chile: Prices versus costs,2017,5.0,"Having a well-adapted transmission network is key for reaching a sustainable energy system, where generators and consumers participate in an efficient market. The purpose of the present research is to estimate the impact on the final prices of the interconnection of the two largest electrical systems in Chile. To this end, an econometric model is used in which prices, among other variables, are explained by the level of marginal costs in the system (opportunity cost), the degree of concentration in the market (market power), and the variability of marginal costs projected by the agents (risk). The data corresponds to bilateral contracts between generators and major clients, from 2006 to 2014. The basic results indicate that the interconnection would benefit final customers by reducing equilibrium contract prices, as a result of the decreased variability of expected marginal costs and a lower concentration of existing generating companies. This study's main contribution is to focus on the benefits of electricity interconnection under conditions of competition and risk, instead of using the simple estimation of direct costs, as has traditionally been done. © 2017 by the authors.",Chile; Contracts; Electricity; Energy policy; Market power; Risk; Transmission,Commerce; Contracts; Costs; Electricity; Energy policy; Risk perception; Risks; Transmissions; Bilateral contracts; Chile; Econometric model; Electrical systems; Electricity interconnections; Generating companies; Market Power; Sustainable energy systems; Electric power system interconnection,Article
"Alshejari A., Kodogiannis V.S.",Electricity price forecasting using asymmetric fuzzy neural network systems,2017,5.0,"Electricity price forecasting is considered as an important tool for energy-related utilities and power generation industries. The deregulation of power market, as well as the competitive financial environment, which have introduced new market players in this field, makes the electricity price forecasting problem a demanding mission. The main focus of this paper is to investigate the performance of asymmetric neuro-fuzzy network models for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. The proposed model has been developed from existing Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy systems by substituting the IF part of fuzzy rules with an asymmetric Gaussian function. In addition, a clustering method is utilised as a pre-processing scheme to identify the initial set and adequate number of clusters and eventually the number of rules in the proposed model. The results corresponding to the minimum and maximum electricity price have indicated that the proposed forecasting scheme could be considered as an improved tool for the forecasting accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.",Clustering; Electricity price forecasting; Neural networks; Neurofuzzy systems; Prediction,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Clustering; Electricity price forecasting; Financial environments; Forecasting accuracy; Fuzzy neural network systems; Neurofuzzy system; Power generation industries; Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Pereira J.P., Pesquita V., Rodrigues P.M.M.",The effect of hydro and wind generation on the mean and volatility of electricity prices in Spain,2017,5.0,"Many electricity markets are experiencing profound changes due to the large-scale deployment of renewable energy. This paper analyzes the effect of wind and hydro power on wholesale electricity prices. We focus on the Spanish market due to the high penetration of wind and hydro, and also the availability of data on water stored in Spanish dams. We estimate the impact of wind generation and hydro availability on the electricity price level and volatility through an ARX-GARCHX model. The results show that these two different renewables have different impacts on electricity prices: intermittent wind generation increases the price volatility, while dispatchable hydro reduces it. The results are consistent with hydropower plants behaving strategically and, given their zero marginal cost, dampening the otherwise higher price increases due to wind intermittency. Therefore, hydropower complements other intermittent renewables, not only operationally, but also economically. © 2017 IEEE.",,Commerce; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Power markets; Electricity prices; Hydropower plants; Intermittent renewables; Large-scale deployment; Price volatility; Renewable energies; Wholesale electricity; Wind generation; Costs,Conference Paper
"Le Coq C., Orzen H., Schwenen S.",Pricing and capacity provision in electricity markets: an experimental study,2017,5.0,"The creation of adequate investment incentives has been of great concern in the restructuring of the electricity sector. However, to achieve this, regulators have applied different market designs across countries and regions. In this paper we employ laboratory methods to explore the relationship between market design, capacity provision and pricing in electricity markets. Subjects act as firms, choosing their generation capacity and competing in uniform price auction markets. We compare three regulatory designs: (1) a baseline price cap system that restricts scarcity rents, (2) a price spike regime that effectively lifts these restrictions, and (3) a capacity market that directly rewards the provision of capacity. Restricting price spikes leads to underinvestment. In line with the regulatory intention both alternative designs lead to sufficient investment albeit at the cost of higher energy prices during peak periods and substantial capacity payments in the capacity market regime. To some extent these results confirm theoretical expectations. However, we also find lower than predicted spot market prices as sellers compete relatively intensely in capacities and prices, and the capacity markets are less competitive than predicted. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Auctions; Electricity; Price caps; Supply function competition,,Article

"Itaba S., Mori H.",A Fuzzy-Preconditioned GRBFN Model for Electricity Price Forecasting,2017,5.0,"This paper proposes a fuzzy-preconditioned ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model for electricity price forecasting. The deregulated electric power systems have been widely spread to trade electric power through electric power markets. The market players are interested in gaining the inside track to maximize the profits and minimize risks in advance. One of the most important tasks is how to forecast a complicated time series of electricity price that affects transmission network congestion. In practice, it is hard to forecast electricity price with the spikes due to the high nonlinearity. In this paper, GRBFN (General Radial Basis Function Network) of ANN is proposed for electricity price forecasting. It is an extension of RBFN of ANN in a way that the optimal parameters of the Gaussian functions are determined by the learning process in RBFN. To improve the model accuracy of GRBFN, FCE (fuzzy c-Elliptotypes) is introduced into GRBFN as a fuzzy precondition technique. FCE is an extension of FCM (fuzzy c-means) and plays a key role to classify input data into fuzzy clusters. The use of FCE contributes to the improvement of model accuracy for spikes of electricity price that bring about much higher price. This paper makes use of DA clustering to evaluate a better initial solution of the parameters of the Gaussian functions. Also, EPSO of evolutionary computation is used to evaluate better weights between neurons. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of electricity price. © 2017 The Author(s).",artificial neural network; DA clustering; electricity price; EPSO; evolutionary computation; fuzzy c-Elliptotypes; fuzzy clustering; global clustering; GRBFN; power markets; RBFN; spikes; time-series forecasting,Adaptive systems; Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Deregulation; Electric power systems; Embedded systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Function evaluation; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy inference; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Time series; DA clustering; Electricity prices; EPSO; fuzzy c-Elliptotypes; Global clustering; GRBFN; RBFN; spikes; Time series forecasting; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Ghosh D., Dutta S., Chakraborty S.",Multifractal behavior of Electricity Bid Price in Indian Energy Market,2016,5.0,"Abstract The bid price of power generation in a country is of extreme importance due to its obvious impact on the industry although it is difficult to explore correlation among cost of a product in any industry with fluctuations of biding price of power. This is due to the fact that the fluctuations are nonlinear and extremely complex. Recent years have witnessed the study of this type of complex systems with powerful tool involving fractal methodology. This paper reports for the first time in Indian scenario a study on the fluctuation pattern of biding price of power in five different bid areas of India with a robust and rigorous technique based on chaos and fractal behavior. The exhaustive study reveals very interesting patterns of the fluctuation process, namely in all domains, the fluctuations are multifractal in time and degree of multifractality is quite different in different zones. The data is completely new and has serious implications on product cost of industry and ultimately on stock price indices. The paper includes possible future applications including predictability of next day price. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity biding prices; Electricity consumption; Multifractals; Time series analysis,Financial markets; Fractals; Power markets; Time series analysis; Chaos and fractal; Electricity-consumption; Energy markets; Indian scenarios; Multifractal behavior; Multifractality; Multifractals; Possible futures; Costs,Article
"Li L., Mendoza-Arriaga R., Mo Z., Mitchell D.",Modelling electricity prices: a time change approach,2016,5.0,"To capture mean reversion and sharp seasonal spikes observed in electricity prices, this paper develops a new stochastic model for electricity spot prices by time changing the Jump Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (JCIR) process with a random clock that is a composite of a Gamma subordinator and a deterministic clock with seasonal activity rate. The time-changed JCIR process is a time-inhomogeneous Markov semimartingale which can be either a jump-diffusion or a pure-jump process, and it has a mean-reverting jump component that leads to mean reversion in the prices in addition to the smooth mean-reversion force. Furthermore, the characteristics of the time-changed JCIR process are seasonal, allowing spikes to occur in a seasonal pattern. The Laplace transform of the time-changed JCIR process can be efficiently computed by Gauss–Laguerre quadrature. This allows us to recover its transition density through efficient Laplace inversion and to calibrate our model using maximum likelihood estimation. To price electricity derivatives, we introduce a class of measure changes that transforms one time-changed JCIR process into another time-changed JCIR process. We derive a closed-form formula for the futures price and obtain the Laplace transform of futures option price in terms of the Laplace transform of the time-changed JCIR process, which can then be efficiently inverted to yield the option price. By fitting our model to two major electricity markets in the US, we show that it is able to capture both the trajectorial and the statistical properties of electricity prices. Comparison with a popular jump-diffusion model is also provided. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Electricity futures and futures options; Electricity spot prices; Laplace transform; Mean-reversion; Seasonality; Spikes; Stochastic time change,,Article

This article extends the conditional autoregressive geometric process (CARGP) model (Chan et al., 2012) to the CARGP model with thresholds and jumps, which is abbreviated as CARGP-TJ model in this article. We will demonstrate that the proposed CARGP-TJ model not only captures the unique features of the electricity price but also performs better than other existing models. For robustness consideration, a heavy-tailed error distribution is adopted. Model implementation relies on the powerful Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques via WinBUGS software.

"Fanzeres B., Street A., Barroso L.A.",Contracting strategies for generation companies with ambiguity aversion on spot price distribution,2014,5.0,"Energy spot price is characterized by its high volatility and difficult prediction, representing a major risk for energy companies, especially those that rely on renewable generation. The typical approach employed by such companies to address their mid- and long-term optimal contracting strategy is to simulate a large set of paths for the uncertainty factors to characterize the probability distribution of the future income and, then, optimize the company portfolio to maximize its certainty equivalent. In practice, however, spot price modeling and simulation is a big challenge for agents due to its high dependence on parameters that are difficult to predict, e.g., GDP growth, demand variation, entrance of new market players, regulatory changes, just to name a few. Under this framework, decisions are made under ambiguity, which happens whenever the decision maker is aware that a given set of scenarios and probabilities represent only an approximation of the true underlying distribution. In this work, robust optimization is used to account for ambiguity aversion in the optimal contracting strategy of renewable generation companies. A case study with data from the Brazilian system is shown to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.",Ambiguity Aversion; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Forward and Capacity Contracts; Hybrid Robust and Stochastic Optimization; Power System Economics; Price-Quantity Risk; Renewable Generation,Costs; Decision making; Economics; Optimization; Value engineering; Ambiguity aversion; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Power system economics; Renewable generation; Stochastic optimizations; Probability distributions,Conference Paper
"Thatte A.A., Choi D.-H., Xie L.",Analysis of locational marginal prices in look-ahead economic dispatch,2014,5.0,"This paper studies the impact of introducing look-ahead dispatch on locational marginal prices in real-time electricity markets. Due to the high forecast error and inter-temporal variability of renewable resources (e.g., wind and solar), many system operators are in the process of upgrading their market clearing engine from static economic dispatch-based ones to dynamic look-ahead economic dispatch-based ones. Compared with conventional static dispatch that calculates the optimal dispatch for the current operating interval, look-ahead dispatch calculates the optimal dispatch solution over multiple future time intervals. Look-ahead dispatch can obtain cost saving by pre-ramping some of the dispatched generators so that the system can more economically match forecast changes in net load (i.e., system load - renewable power output). In addition to the cost saving benefit, system operators in RTOs claim that look-ahead dispatch results in lower price volatility than static dispatch. In this paper, we attempt to demystify this industry claim and provide counterexamples to this claim. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between price volatility and some key factors such as system-wide ramping capability, the number of time intervals in look-ahead dispatch horizon, load pattern and forecast uncertainty. The simulation results are illustrated with numerical examples in the IEEE 14-bus system. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.",Electricity market; locational marginal price; look-ahead economic dispatch,Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Power markets; Scheduling; Economic Dispatch; Electricity market; Forecast uncertainty; Locational marginal prices; Market clearing engines; Price volatility; Renewable resource; Temporal variability; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper
"Pospiech M., Felden C.",Towards a price forecast model for the German electricity market based on structured and unstructured data,2014,5.0,"As in many power markets, electricity is traded in exchanges or Over-the-counter. Market participants require an accurate price forecast to maximum their profits. Hereby, important events have to be considered instantly since the information value falls quickly. Real time information can be extracted from unstructured news tickers. Nevertheless, current forecast systems utilize exclusively structured attributes such as historical price, coal or gas and neglecting published messages. As an initial step, the paper will investigates if a forecast is possible through text data and if the overall forecast accuracy increases. To address the issue, a price trend classification is executed based on data and text mining techniques. The results are interesting. Unstructured text data enables an adequate forecast. Although, the combination of both data types can exceed the individual models itself.

"Nazer Kakhki I., Taherian H., Aghaebrahimi M.R.",Short-term price forecasting under high penetration of wind generation units in smart grid environment,2013,5.0,"With the emergence of smart grids, customers have become capable of reacting to the fluctuations in electricity price. Therefore, electricity price is a key element in optimum demand side management (DSM) in this environment. Accurate short-term forecasting of electricity price is of great importance for the market participants. However, due to the nonlinear, stochastic and time-variant nature of electricity price, accurate forecasting is extremely difficult. On the other hand, distributed generation resources, especially the wind, have widely penetrated these networks and the real time balancing of the demand and generation of power systems has become extremely complicated due to the variable nature of wind generation. In this paper, considering high penetration levels of wind generation, the short-term forecasting of electricity price is investigated based on the Nord Pool power market data. The main idea is based on presenting a hybrid model which consists of a multi-layer perceptron neural network and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) which uses a data clustering technique based on imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA).

Wavelet transform (WT) is applied to pre-process the data and reconfigure the forecasts. To optimize the parameters of the model in SVM approach, the two-layer Grid Search Method (GSM) is adopted. The proposed method is applied and examined by the information and data of New South Wales (2012)in Australian National Electricity Market. Case study indicates that the hybrid method can better capture the patterns of price data and predict the electricity price more accurately than individual methods. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.",Electricity price forecasting; Grid search method; Hybrid method; Neural network; Support vector machine,,Article
"Panyakaew P., Damrongkulkamjorn P.",Hybrid computational method for step-bidding price optimal power flow,2013,5.0,This paper presents hybrid computational method for step-bidding price optimal power flow where the objective is to minimize total generation cost consisting of several step bidding prices from participated generators. The constraints are power balanced equations and system operating limits. The algorithm assumed a constant forecasted real power demand and no bilateral contracts. The hybrid computational method decomposes the calculations into two parts: the market dispatch part; and the power flow dispatch part. The bidding prices and the amount of power willing to produce are submitted from generators in form of several bidding blocks. The market dispatch part gives the results in terms of allocation of the bids of real power generations at each bus based only on the price offered without considering physical limits of the power systems. The power flow dispatch part minimizes the changes of real power generations resulting from the market dispatch part while satisfying power flow and necessary limits. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 30 bus system. Four interesting case studies have been illustrated with satisfying results. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.,Bidding price; Electricity market; Hybrid computational method; Optimal power flow,,Article
Qiu Z.-W.,Mutivariable mutual information based feature selection for electricity price forecasting,2012,5.0,"In a competitive electricity market, the electricity price forecasting provides a useful information for suppliers to develop bidding strategies or to make investment decisions. Customers can also be benefit by scheduling their electricity consumption according to the electricity price. Selecting proper and useful features plays an essential role in improving the forecasting accuracy. In this paper, multivariable mutual information is applied for feature selection to select the more relation between the output price and the candidate input features.

"Fuglerud M., Vedahl K.E., Fleten S.-E.",Equilibrium simulation of the Nordic electricity spot price,2012,5.0,"We develop a bottom-up, midterm model for the Nord Pool system price. Models for consumption, generation and exchange are combined using a market equilibrium approach. Scenarios for the most influential stochastic factors are created using statistical models. Forecasted price scenarios yield an indication on the expected future system price, and the uncertainty in future prices. Compared to stochastic dynamic programming based models, we use an empirical function to approximate the water value, with a possible benefit in terms of computational effort. In addition to providing a picture of the price distribution, the model can be applied to learn about the impact of fundamental variables. In particular, we study the relative influence of each of the stochastic factors. The performance of the model is evaluated in numerical examples over a two-year forecast period. Overall, we conclude the model provides realistic forecasts of the system price and its distribution. The performance under normal market conditions may deviate from our results, due to the extraordinary drop in fuel prices caused by the financial crisis. © 2012 IEEE.",bootstrapping; electricity prices; fuel uncertainty; heating degree days; partial equilibrium; Power system economics; snow reservoirs; Sobol sequence; unit outage uncertainty; wind uncertainty,bootstrapping; Electricity prices; Heating degree-days; Partial equilibrium; Power system economics; Sobol sequence; unit outage uncertainty; Wind uncertainties; Commerce; Normal distribution; Outages; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Costs,Conference Paper

"Moazzami M., Hooshmand R.A.",Short-term nodal congestion price forecasting in a large-scale power market using ANN with genetic optimization training,2012,5.0,"In a daily power market, price and load forecasting are the most important signals for the market participants. In this paper, an accurate feed-forward neural network model with a genetic optimization Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation training algorithm is employed for short-term nodal congestion price forecasting in different zones of a large-scale power market. The use of genetic algorithms for neural network training optimization has a remarkable effect on the accuracy of price forecasting in a large-scale power market. The necessary data for neural network training are obtained by solving optimal power flow equations that take into account all effective constraints at any hour of the day in a single month. The structure of the neural network has 2 input signals of active and reactive powers for every load busbar in every hour of the programming model. These 2 signals are always available. In this study, an IEEE 118-bus power system is used to test the proposed method authenticity. This system is divided into 3 zones, and a neural network with genetic algorithm training optimization is employed for every zone. Performance of the proposed method is compared with ARIMA and GARCH time series for the same data. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is robust, efficient, and accurate. Therefore, the algorithm produces better results than the ARIMA and GARCH time series for short-term nodal congestion price forecasting. © TÜBİTAK.",Artificial neural network; Genetic algorithm; Nodal congestion price; Price forecasting,Congestion price; Genetic optimization; Input signal; Levenberg-Marquardt; Market participants; Neural network training; Optimal power flows; Power markets; Price and load forecasting; Price forecasting; Programming models; Training algorithms; Commerce; Computer programming; Costs; Forecasting; Neural networks; Optimization; Time series; Genetic algorithms,Article

"Haugom E., Westgaard S., Solibakke P.B., Lien G.",Modelling day ahead nord pool forward price volatility: Realized volatility versus GARCH models,2010,5.0,"Traditionally, and still within electricity futures/forward markets, daily data has been utilized as the unit of analyses when modelling and making predictions of volatility. However, over the recent past it is argued that better volatility estimates can be obtained by using standard time series techniques on non-parametric volatility measures constructed from high-frequency intradaily returns. Liquidity in financial electricity markets has increased rapidly over the recent years, which make it possible to apply these relatively new methods for measuring market volatility. In this paper high-frequency data and the concept of realized volatility is utilized to make day ahead predictions of Nord Pool forward price volatility. Such short term volatility predictions are especially important for operators and other participants in the electricity sector. We compare the results obtained from standard time-series techniques with the more traditional GARCH-framework which utilizes daily returns. Additionally, we examine whether different approaches of decomposing the total variation into a continuous - and jump measure improves the model fit or not. The paper provides new insights to how the financial electricity market at Nord Pool works, and how we efficiently can model and make predictions of the price movements in this market. © 2010 IEEE.",Electricity forward prices; GARCH; High-frequency; Long memory; Nord pool; Realized volatility,Forward price; GARCH; High frequency HF; Long memories; Nord pool; Realized volatility; Costs; Electric industry; Electricity; Forecasting; Lakes; Time series; Commerce,Conference Paper

Long-term prices of electricity, oil, coal, natural gas, emission allowance, imported electricity, and aluminum are modeled with a vector autoregressive model (VAR). For estimation, we use weekly prices of far-maturity forwards relevant for the Nordic electricity market. Although electricity prices experienced a few substantial shocks during the period we analyzed, there is no evidence of a structural break.

"Ofuji K., Kanemoto S.",Price forecasting of Japan electric power exchange using time-varying AR model,2007,5.0,"In this article, we built a state space model to analyze the price time series in Japan Electric Power Exchange(JEPX) spot market. In building the model, we aimed to achieve the following two goals that the model was able to a) forecast prices with reasonable accuracy, and b) understand the underlying market dynamics by decomposing the price time series into a reasonable set of contributing factors. To capture the time-variability of the contributing factors to price, self-AR(autoregressive) process was introduced to allow continuous change in the magnitude of influence from each explanatory variable. To estimate the model, Kalman Filter algorithm was applied for stepwise recursive estimation. After optimizing the model under the maximum likelihood method(MLM) coupled with minimum AIC(Akaike Information Criteria) conditions, the model was able to decompose the 15:00-15:30 JEPX spot electricity strip price into a couple of the most contributing factors with significant time-dependencies.

"Uhlen K., Warland L., Grande O.S.",Model for area price determination and congestion management in joint power markets,2005,5.0,"The Market Splitting principle, used by Nord Pool in the Nordic day-ahead market, is an option also for the creation of a liberalized single market for electricity across the EU. However, improvements in the methodology for area price determination and congestion management are needed to make this model suitable for the more meshed and complex power system in central Europe. Alternative methodologies have been proposed where power flow calculations are included, and the main purpose of this paper is to present a simulation model which can be used to assess alternative methods for congestion management. The paper describes a simulation model where the Flow Based Market Coupling method is implemented and demonstrated. This method can be seen as a compromise between nodal pricing and market splitting (area pricing), where the criterion for congestion management is minimization of the Socio-economic Congestion Cost. The main principles for the proposed model are described, and case studies are performed on a generic system model in order to highlight the main characteristics of the method, and to summarise the main benefits and challenges that remain for a practical implementation of the Flow Based Market Coupling method. The case studies show that the method has the potential to solve the congestion management problem in a way that is optimal from a socio-economic point of view. The total costs of congestions are minimized, and the maximum differences in area prices are normally reduced. As a consequence the transmission system utilization is improved and the market players' risk referred to area prices is reduced. However, a successful implementation of the method depends heavily on the power flow model that is applied. It is of vital importance that this model is sufficiently accurate and continuously updated to predict the actual power flows on the main cross-border transmission corridors. © 2005 IEEE.",Congestion Management; Day ahead Market; Flow Based Market Coupling; Market Splitting; Power Exchange,Computer simulation; Cost effectiveness; Electric power systems; Electricity; Marketing; Optimization; Risk management; Congestion Management; Day ahead Market; Flow Based Market Coupling; Market Splitting; Power Exchange; Electric power distribution,Conference Paper

"Shah I., Lisi F.",Forecasting of electricity price through a functional prediction of sale and purchase curves,2020,4.0,"This work proposes a new approach for the prediction of the electricity price based on forecasting aggregated purchase and sale curves. The basic idea is to model the hourly purchase and the sale curves, to predict them and to find the intersection of the predicted curves in order to obtain the predicted equilibrium market price and volume. Modeling and forecasting of purchase and sale curves is performed by means of functional data analysis methods. More specifically, parametric (FAR) and nonparametric (NPFAR) functional autoregressive models are considered and compared to some benchmarks. An appealing feature of the functional approach is that, unlike other methods, it provides insights into the sale and purchase mechanism connected with the price and demand formation process and can therefore be used for the optimization of bidding strategies.

"Bisoi R., Dash P.K., Das P.P.",Short-term electricity price forecasting and classification in smart grids using optimized multikernel extreme learning machine,2020,4.0,"Short-term electricity price forecasting in deregulated electricity markets has been studied extensively in recent years but without significant reduction in price forecasting errors. Also demand-side management and short-term scheduling operations in smart grids do not require strictly very accurate forecast and can be executed with certain practical price thresholds. This paper, therefore, presents a multikernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) for both short-term electricity price forecasting and classification according to some prespecified price thresholds. The kernel ELM does not require the hidden layer mapping function to be known and produces robust prediction and classification in comparison with the conventional ELM using random weights between the input and hidden layers. Further in the MKELM formulation, the linear combination of the weighted kernels is optimized using vaporization precipitation-based water cycle algorithm (WCA) to produce significantly accurate electricity price prediction and classification. The combination of MKELM and WCA is named as WCA-MKELM in this work. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, three electricity markets, namely PJM, Ontario and New South Wales, are considered for electricity price forecasting and classification producing fairly accurate results. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Electricity price forecasting and classification; Extreme learning machine; Kernel extreme learning machine; Kernel functions; Mutated water cycle algorithm; Price thresholds,Commerce; Deregulation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme learning machine; Kernel function; Price thresholds; Water cycle; Power markets,Article
"Ferdous J., Mollah M.P., Razzaque M.A., Hassan M.M., Alamri A., Fortino G., Zhou M.",Optimal Dynamic Pricing for Trading-Off User Utility and Operator Profit in Smart Grid,2020,4.0,"A conventional power grid is criticized by its poor capability of power usage management, especially in handling dynamically varying power demands over time. The concept of smart grid has been introduced to mitigate this problem by satisfying not only real-time power demands, but also by restricting power usage within the capacity. Its consistent outperformance and new perspective in computer intelligence to control the grid for autonomous power consumption has been gradually replacing the conventional power grid. However, even in smart grid, providing high satisfaction to users often leads smart grid operator (SGO) to loss and vice versa. In this paper, we develop an optimal dynamic pricing mechanism for trading-off (ODPT), for SGOs that tradeoff between user utility and operator profit in smart grid systems. It allows the operator to purchase power from multiple energy producers and to set selling price to users dynamically following the demand-supply theory of economics. It also exploits an artificial neural network model to more accurately predict the power usage. The simulation results, carried out on a commercially available optimization modeling tool using practical power usage data, prove the effectiveness of the proposed ODPT in increasing the operator profit while satisfying user demands. © 2013 IEEE.",Dynamic power pricing; Internet of Things (IoT); operator profit; smart grid; smart grid operator (SGO); user utility,Costs; Data structures; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Green computing; Interactive computer systems; Internet of things; Neural networks; Optimization; Production; Profitability; Real time systems; Dynamic power pricing; Internet of Things (IOT); Power demands; Predictive models; Smart grid; User utility; Smart power grids,Article
"Deng L., Li Z., Sun H., Guo Q., Xu Y., Chen R., Wang J., Guo Y.",Generalized locational marginal pricing in a heat-and-electricity-integrated market,2019,4.0,"In this paper, a new pricing method derived from the heat-and-electricity-integrated market clearing problem, referred to as generalized locational marginal pricing (GLMP), is presented. The market clearing problem is formulated by the independent system operator (ISO) to coordinate the electric power system with the district heating system by considering time-delay effects in the heating transfer process. GLMP is explained as the shadow price related to the nodal electricity balance and nodal heat balance at the optimal solution. Without considering network constraints, a simplified market clearing problem is proposed to illustrate the price linkage between heating and electricity markets through combined heat and power joint costs and feasible regions. Rational generation units will behave exactly as the ISO predicts by maximizing their individual producer surplus. Then, a compact form of the complete market clearing problem is employed to derive the detailed components of GLMP, namely, the extended marginal generation component, marginal loss component, and marginal congestion component. Furthermore, time-delay effects are reflected in the pricing. Numerical results verify the validity of component classification in GLMP and demonstrate that the proposed method can promote efficiency improvements and reduce cross-subsidies. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",combined heat and power; cost allocation; cross-subsidy; integrated energy system; Locational marginal pricing,Commerce; District heating; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Location; Numerical methods; Power generation; Time delay; Combined heat and power; Cost allocation; Cross subsidy; Integrated energy systems; Locational marginal pricing; Costs,Article

The aim of this research is to introduce a short-term electricity price forecasting method that addresses the problems of price volatility, a varying number of input parameters, varying data availability, and a large number of parameters and input data. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used on any market as it targets the characteristics and specifics of each market. The proposed Hybrid Iterative Reactive Adaptive (HIRA) method consists of two phases. In analysis phase, fundamental parameters which affect the electricity price are identified depending on market development. Obtained parameters are used as data inputs for price forecasting using a hybrid method. The HIRA model combines a statistical approach for large data set analysis and a similar day method with neural network tools. Similar days are examined using a statistical method which combines correlation significance, price volatility, and forecasting accuracy of the historical data. Data are collected based on their availability and electricity prices are forecasted in several iterations. All relevant data for price forecasting are collected, categorized, and arranged using simple indicators which makes the HIRA model adaptive and reactive to new market circumstances. The proposed model is validated using the Hungarian Power Exchange (HUPX) electricity price data records. The results show that with HIRA model forecasting, the error is stable and does not depend on price volatility. The HIRA method has proven to be applicable for forecasting electricity prices in real-time market conditions and enables effective hedging of price risk in the production or market portfolio. © 2019 by the authors.",Data mining; Dynamic hybrid model; Electricity market; Electricity price; Neural network; Short-term electricity price forecast; Spot market,Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Electric utilities; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Competitive power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price volatilities; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Hybrid model; Spot market; Power markets,Article

We undertake in-sample and out-of-sample tests using daily electricity prices, and evidence that our model provides accurate forecasts of the underlying distribution and outperforms a set of competing models in their abilities to forecast one-day-ahead conditional quantiles of a portfolio of electricity prices. Our study is conducted in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), which is the most efficient power auction in the world. Electricity prices exhibit highly stylised features such as extreme price spikes, price dependency between regional markets, correlation asymmetry and non-linear dependency. The developed approach can be used as a risk management tool in the electricity retail industry, which plays an integral role in the apparatus of modern energy markets. Electricity retailers are responsible for the efficient distribution of electricity, while being exposed to market risk with extreme magnitudes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Back-testing; Dvine copula; Electricity prices; Nonlinear dependence; SCAR model,Commerce; Costs; Electric power system interconnection; Forecasting; Risk management; Australian electricities; Australian national electricity market (NEM); Conditional quantiles; Dvine copula; Electricity prices; Modelling and forecasting; Nonlinear dependence; Underlying distribution; Power markets; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy market; forecasting method; nonlinearity; price determination; Australia,Article

"Smith M.S., Shively T.S.",Econometric modeling of regional electricity spot prices in the Australian market,2018,4.0,"Wholesale electricity markets are increasingly integrated via high voltage interconnectors, and inter-regional trade in electricity is growing. To model this, we consider a spatial equilibrium model of price formation, where constraints on inter-regional flows result in three distinct equilibria in prices. We use this to motivate an econometric model for the distribution of observed electricity spot prices that captures many of their unique empirical characteristics. The econometric model features supply and inter-regional trade cost functions, which are estimated using Bayesian monotonic regression smoothing methodology. A copula multivariate time series model is employed to capture additional dependence — both cross-sectional and serial — in regional prices. The marginal distributions are nonparametric, with means given by the regression means. The model has the advantage of preserving the heavy right-hand tail in the predictive densities of price. We fit the model to half-hourly spot price data in the five interconnected regions of the Australian national electricity market. The fitted model is then used to measure how both supply and price shocks in one region are transmitted to the distribution of prices in all regions in subsequent periods. Finally, to validate our econometric model, we show that prices forecast using the proposed model compares favorably with those from some benchmark alternatives. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian monotonic function estimation; Copula time series model; Intraday electricity prices,Commerce; Cost functions; Electric power system interconnection; Power markets; Time series; Australian national electricity markets; Electricity prices; Empirical characteristics; Monotonic functions; Multivariate time series models; Spatial equilibrium models; Time series modeling; Wholesale electricity markets; Costs; Bayesian analysis; econometrics; electricity supply; energy market; estimation method; numerical model; price dynamics; time series analysis; Australia,Article

Exploiting the System Generalized Methods of Moments estimation technique for the period spanning 2002–2015, the results indicate that the overall effect of energy prices on economic growth is significantly negative. This effect propagates mainly through government consumption expenditure and investment, albeit its effect through real interest rate is positive. However, its negative effects on government consumption, investment, and exchange rate significantly overwhelm the positive effect from real interest rate. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",economic growth; energy prices; Ghana; System GMM,economic growth; economic relations; energy market; exchange rate; expenditure; interest rate; investment; panel data; price dynamics; regional economy,Article
"Herrero I., Rodilla P., Batlle C.",Enhancing intraday price signals in U.S. ISO markets for a better integration of variable energy resources,2018,4.0,"Efficient operation of power systems increasingly requires accurate forecasting of load and variable energy resources (VER) production, along with flexible resources and markets, capable of adapting to changing conditions in the intraday horizon. It is of utmost importance to reflect these needs in price signals, to align the incentives of market agents with the new challenges. The two‑settlement system used by U.S. ISOs falls short to provide efficient intraday economic signals and a cost reflective allocation of intraday rescheduling costs. This paper advocates for a multi‑settlement system, which entails calculating intraday prices as forecasts are updated and re‑schedules are executed. This approach incorporates more granular prices, as in European intraday markets, while keeping the efficient centralized dispatch logic of the ISO model. A stylized case example illustrates the virtues of a multi‑settlement system, which sends cost reflective signals, and consequently facilitates VER integration. Copyright © 2018 by the IAEE.

Shang D.R.,Pricing of emergency dynamic microgrid power service for distribution resilience enhancement,2017,4.0,"Extreme weather events can cause significant damage to power distribution grids, leading to extended power outages. Intentional islanding enables the use of distributed energy resources (DERs) to power critical loads and accelerate grid restoration. In this study, an innovative dynamic microgrid islanding scheme was investigated as a means of enhancing distribution grid resilience. If customers in a dynamic microgrid request emergency electricity services during an outage, the question of how the distribution system operator should price the DER emergency power service arises. To answer this question, an economic load dispatch model was implemented in a single-bid auction market to forecast the market-clearing price of electricity in the dynamic microgrid island. The results show that the cost of emergency service is impacted by the power supply and demand in the island. When the combined heat and power plant capacity of the dynamic microgrid exceeded the demand, the market-clearing price of electricity in the island could be even less than the on-grid electricity price during normal periods. Thus, the dynamic microgrid scheme provides a low-cost means of supplying end-users with emergency power. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Distributed energy resources; Dynamic microgrid; Economic load dispatch; Electricity pricing; Intentional islanding,Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Costs; Distributed power generation; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Emergency services; Energy policy; Energy resources; Outages; Distributed Energy Resources; Economic load dispatch; Electricity pricing; Intentional islanding; Micro grid; Electric load dispatching; distribution system; electricity supply; energy market; energy resource; pricing policy,Article
"Talari S., Shafie-khah M., Osório G.J., Wang F., Heidari A., Catalão J.P.S.",Price forecasting of electricity markets in the presence of a high penetration of wind power generators,2017,4.0,"Price forecasting plays a vital role in the day-ahead markets. Once sellers and buyers access an accurate price forecasting, managing the economic risk can be conducted appropriately through offering or bidding suitable prices. In networks with high wind power penetration, the electricity price is influenced by wind energy; therefore, price forecasting can be more complicated. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for price forecasting of day-ahead markets, with high penetration of wind generators based on Wavelet transform, bivariate Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN). To this end, a weighted time series for wind dominated power systems is calculated and added to a bivariate ARIMA model along with the price time series. Moreover, RBFN is applied as a tool to correct the estimation error, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the structure and adapt the RBFN to the particular training set. This method is evaluated on the Spanish electricity market, which shows the efficiency of this approach. This method has less error compared with other methods especially when it considers the effects of large-scale wind generators. © 2017 by the authors.",Bivariate ARIMA; Hybrid method; Price forecasting; Wavelet transform; Wind generator,accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; economic analysis; electricity industry; optimization; power generation; price dynamics; wavelet analysis; wind power,Article

The accurate forecasting of price of electric power is a need of every participant in restructured power system scenario. Hence, this paper is an attempt to apply data mining for forecasting the electricity price. The k-mean algorithm is used for classification of data of historical prices of New York Energy Market (NYISO) according to type of day, into three classes. The k-NN algorithm to divide the classified data into two patterns for month of February-March and April to January. Once classification is done, the data is used for developing forecasting model. The historical electricity price data of 2014, along with load is used as input patterns. The accuracy of the developed model is verified by forecasting respective period samples of 2015.

"Rentschler J., Kornejew M.",Energy price variation and competitiveness: Firm level evidence from Indonesia,2017,4.0,"This paper uses firm survey data from the manufacturing and mining sectors in Indonesia, and investigates the extent to which energy prices affect competitiveness (proxied by profitability). Persistent regional price differences due to Indonesia's insular geography enable this study to show that energy prices have a small (but statistically significant) adverse long-run effect on competitiveness – though different energy types matter in different sectors. By estimating cross and own price elasticities and Uzawa-Allen partial elasticities of (inter-fuel) substitution, this study also shows that firms have the ability to respond to higher energy prices by adjusting their energy mix, i.e. substituting certain energy goods for others. Moreover, this study shows that firms also respond to higher energy prices by increasing energy efficiency, and by passing on costs to end-users. Nevertheless, these response measures are not sufficient to fully mitigate the adverse effect of energy prices on firms. Based on these results, policy recommendations are offered which are of immediate relevance for the design of energy pricing reforms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Competitiveness; Energy prices; Firms; Fossil fuel subsidies,Costs; Elasticity; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Adverse effect; Competitiveness; Energy prices; Firms; Own-price elasticities; Policy recommendations; Price difference; Response measures; Competition; competitiveness; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; fossil fuel; policy reform; price dynamics; profitability; subsidy system; Indonesia,Article
"Choi D.-H., Xie L.",Impact of power system network topology errors on real-time locational marginal price,2017,4.0,"This paper examines the impact of power transmission network topology change on locational marginal price (LMP) in real-time power markets. We consider the case where the false status of circuit breakers (CBs) that bypass topology error processing can generate an incorrect power system network topology, subsequently distorting the results of the state estimation and economic dispatch. The main goal of this paper is to assess the economic impact of this misconfigured network topology on real-time LMP in an entire power system with network congestion. To this end, we start with our prior result, a simple and analytical congestion price equation, which can be applied to any single line congestion scenario. This equation can be extended to better understand the degree to which the LMP at any bus changes due to any line status error. Furthermore, it enables a rigorous analysis of the relationship between the change in LMP at any bus with respect to any line error and various physical/economical grid conditions such as the bidding prices for marginal generators and the locations of the congested/erroneous lines. Numerical examples on the impact analysis of this topology error are illustrated in IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems. © 2017, The Author(s).",Economic dispatch; Locational marginal price; Power market; Power system network topology,Commerce; Costs; Electric circuit breakers; Electric power transmission networks; Errors; Location; Numerical methods; Power markets; Scheduling; Topology; Economic Dispatch; Line congestions; Locational marginal prices; Network congestions; Power system networks; Real time power market; Rigorous analysis; Topology error processing; Electric load dispatching,Article
"Li P., Arci F., Reilly J., Curran K., Belatreche A., Shynkevich Y.",Predicting short-term wholesale prices on the Irish single electricity market with artificial neural networks,2017,4.0,"The ability to operate effectively on electricity spot markets relies on the capability to devise appropriate bidding strategies. These in turn can benefit from the inclusion of a reliable forecast of short term system marginal prices (SMPs). In a market with an increasing percentage of renewable generators, reliable forecasts must necessarily consider additional factors such as meteorological forecasts, forecasted demand and constraints imposed by network topology. Traditional time series forecasting algorithms (e.g. based on AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models) can perform reasonably well in this context but rely on assumptions being made on behavior over different temporal windows to yield consistent results. Research studies have demonstrated that an adaptive or self-adaptive approach to forecasting would appear more suited to the task of predicting energy demands in territory such as Ireland. Implementing an in-house self-adaptive model should yield good results in the dynamic uncertain Irish energy market. We have identified the features that such a model demands and outline it here. © 2017 IEEE.",,Commerce; Forecasting; Neural networks; Shape memory effect; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Electricity spot market; Renewable generators; Self adaptive approach; Self-adaptive models; System marginal price; Time series forecasting; Whole sale prices; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Jain A.K., Srivastava S.C.",Price Responsive Demand Management of an Industrial Buyer in Day-ahead Electricity Market,2017,4.0,"An industrial buyer, who can reschedule its production plan, may develop strategic bid by shifting its demand from high price period to low price period. Based on this concept, a new optimization formulation has been proposed to develop bidding strategy of such buyers considering Price Responsive Demand Shifting (PRDS). Since the bidding strategy of the buyer depends upon the market clearing price, which is volatile/uncertain due to various factors like gaming behavior of participants, demand forecasting error, transmission congestion etc, the proposed optimization problem is formulated as a stochastic linear problem, comprising of two sub-problems. The first sub-problem represents the market clearing process by the System Operator, which is formulated to maximize the social welfare of the market participants, while the second sub-problem aims at maximizing the purchase cost saving of the industrial buyer. The optimal bidding strategy has been obtained by solving these two sub-problems considering hourly market clearing for 24-hour scheduling period. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested on a 5-bus system and modified IEEE 30-bus system. Results obtained with the demand shifting based bidding strategy have been compared with those obtained with a Conventional Price Quantity (CPQ) bid strategy. It has been observed that the proposed approach leads to enhancement in the purchase cost saving as compared to the CPQ and meets the energy consumption targets of the industrial buyer. © 2017 by De Gruyter 2017.",electricity market; optimal bidding strategy; price responsive demand shifting; stochastic linear optimization; uniform market clearing price,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Linear programming; Optimization; Production control; Sales; Stochastic systems; Day-ahead electricity market; Linear optimization; Market Clearing Price; Optimal bidding strategy; Optimization formulations; Price responsive demand; Price responsive demand shifting; Transmission congestion; Power markets,Article
"Clements A.E., Hurn A.S., Li Z.",The effect of transmission constraints on electricity prices,2017,4.0,"Electricity prices in an interconnected market are influenced by the occurrence of transmission constraints. Until relatively recently, however, the important effects of transmission constraints on both the trajectory and volatility of electricity prices have not played a large role in empirical models of prices. This paper explores the contribution to price volatility in the Queensland electricity market made by transmission constraints. It is found that robust estimation techniques are necessary to guard against incorrect inference in time series models using electricity price data in which severe price spikes occur. The main empirical lesson is that transmission constraints contribute significantly both to the level and variability of price and consequently the performance of a price forecasting model is likely to be improved by incorporating information on transmission constraints. While the general tenor of this conclusion will come as no surprise, the extent and the importance of these effects found in this paper for forecasting price and for computing summary measures like Value-at-Risk serve as a timely reminder to practitioners. © 2017 by the IAEE.",Price spikes; Regional electricity prices; Transmission constraints,,Article
"Kim J.-H., Kim C.-H.",Smart EVs charging scheme for load leveling considering ToU price and actual data,2017,4.0,"With the current global need for eco-friendly energies, the large scale use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is predicted. However, the need to frequently charge EVs to an electrical power system involves risks such as rapid increase of demand power. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a practical smart EV charging scheme considering a Time-of-Use (ToU) price to prevent the rapid increase of demand power and provide load leveling function. For a more practical analysis, we conduct simulations based on the actual distribution system and driving patterns in the Republic of Korea. Results show that the proposed method provides a proper load leveling function while preventing a rapid increase of demand power of the system. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.",Charging load; Electric vehicle; Load levelling; Smart charging; Time-of-Use price,Costs; Electric power systems; Electric vehicles; Charging loads; Distribution systems; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electrical power system; Load levelling; Smart charging; Time of use price; Time of use prices (TOU); Charging (batteries),Article
"Lebedev D., Rosin A., Kutt L.",Simulation of real time electricity price based Energy Management System,2016,4.0,"The aim of the case study was to determine profitability of Energy Management System (EMS) in the intraday market like Elbas (Nord Pool Spot). To optimize the operation of EMS, a Demand Response (DR) algorithm was used for the calculation of a battery bank charge-discharge schedule (BCDS) taking into account the volatility in the Real-Time price (RTP). The profits are gained from importing and storing more energy at low price periods while decreasing the imported power from the grid at high price periods and dispatching the stored energy for load demands. The forecast procedure analyzes the history of the energy price for a predefined back-time period and optimizes the BCDS to bring the highest profit to the end customer. The results are composed from typical parameters of a household's energy demand applied in EMS. The results obtained were compared with those from laboratory obtained by the Day-Ahead price based control algorithm.

"Ntakou E., Caramanis M.",Enhanced convergence rate of inequality constraint shadow prices in PMP algorithm cleared distribution power markets,2016,4.0,"The extension of Transmission Locational Marginal Cost Prices (LMP) to Distribution node LMPs, or DLMPs, is a prerequisite for efficient demand response that may support significant integration of Renewables. AC load flow and non-linear distribution cost modeling needed to this end, render centralized market clearing Algorithms intractable, with Distributed Proximal Message Passing (PMP) Algorithms offering what appears to be the only scalable and tractable alternative. DLMPs of real and reactive power are associated with equality power balance constraint shadow prices at each distribution node, while, allowable voltage limit inequality constraints are associated with inequality constraint shadow prices. This paper addresses the slower convergence rate of voltage constraint shadow price estimates in PMP algorithms. In particular, we use first order optimality conditions to derive relations that characterize the interaction of equality and inequality shadow prices across the distribution network, and employ them to construct a filter that enhances the estimation accuracy of voltage inequality constraint shadow prices. We show that use of this filter results in a significant speedup of the PMP algorithm's convergence rate for both voltage shadow prices as well as DLMPs. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,,Conference Paper

This paper places itself in price directed power systems, where participants respond with their load demand to incoming price signals. To that end, a two hour-ahead forecasting method using a linear composition of kernel machines for electricity prices is introduced. Initially, two kernel machines, i.e., a Gaussian process (GP) and a relevance vector machine (RVM), are utilized for next-two-hour prediction making. Subsequently, a linear predictor composed of the two kernel machines, which are both equipped with the Gaussian kernel, is built that integrates the individual predictions to provide a single one. The linear coefficients are obtained as the solution of multiobjective problem that is sought by a genetic algorithm utilizing Pareto optimality theory. Method testing is performed on a set of historical data obtained from the New England area. The proposed Pareto optimal kernel machine composition outperforms in terms of accuracy the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) predictor as well as the individual kernel machines in the vast majority of the tested cases. © 2015 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; GP; Pareto optimality; RVM; smart power systems,Forecasting; Gaussian noise (electronic); Genetic algorithms; Global positioning system; Information science; Pareto principle; Power markets; Autoregressive moving average; Electricity price forecasting; Individual prediction; Multi-objective problem; Pareto-optimality; Relevance Vector Machine; Smart power distribution systems; Very short term forecasting; Costs,Conference Paper
"Bigerna S., Bollino C.A.",Optimal price design in the wholesale electricity market,2016,4.0,"In this paper, we construct an optimal price design mechanism to determine the equilibrium in the day-Ahead electricity market, specifically aimed at solving the uncomfortable conflict between conventional thermal sources (CTS) and renewable energy sources (RES). We find that the actual hourly market design is inadequate to achieve an efficient solution in the presence of a large and increasing share of RES. It is not conducive to catalyzing the correct price signal for future investments and does not take into account welfare considerations. Our proposal for a new market design is based on three main pillars. We state pro-competitive incentives to CTS participation in the market. We take into full account the opportunity cost of RES for society and propose correct price signals on the demand side through an optimal Ramsey pricing scheme. We show an empirical application to the Italian electricity market, using empirical measures of LCOE for RES and empirical estimation of heterogeneous buyers' behavior.

"Abdullah M.P., Nazar N.S.M., Hassan M.Y., Hussin F.",Optimizing time of use (ToU) electricity pricing in regulated market,2016,4.0,"Time-of-Use (ToU) electricity price for residential consumers is receiving lots of attention lately with the increment of smart meters usage among residential customers. ToU prices reflect the actual electricity cost and the rate is commonly set base on market price of electricity. Implementing ToU pricing system on a regulated electricity system such as in Malaysia is complicated due to non existence of electricity market. The electrical utility company or the regulator will need to determine the optimum ToU prices that would give the correct price signal so that customers will react accordingly. Many factors need to be considered such as impact on electricity generation cost, load profile, load elasticity and customers’ satisfaction. This paper presents an optimization method to estimate the optimum ToU prices for given electricity demand profile and demand elasticity. The presented method able to reduce the gap between peak and off-peak demand and ensure the estimated ToU prices are fairly proportionate among hours i.e. summation of rate increments (from the fixed price) is equal to the summation of rate decrements. A simple system is used as a case study to demonstrate the application of the optimization method presented. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

"Singh N.K., Singh A.K., Tripathy M.",Short-term load/price forecasting in deregulated electric environment using ELMAN neural network,2015,4.0,"Load forecasting plays a significant role in power system planning. In today's scenario of deregulated electricity market as existing in New South Wales (NSW) Australia, an extremely accurate load/ price forecasting model is required because of several economic and operational advantages. It helps in dealing with the problems of economic load dispatch, unit commitment, protection, etc. Research shows that most of the classical methods are incapable to forecast the load/ price with highest possible precision, as per the expectation of deregulated and complex electricity markets.

"Koban V., Zlatar I., Pantoš M., Omladič M.",A remark on forecasting spikes in electricity prices,2015,4.0,"This paper presents a hybrid model for electricity price forecasting with focus on price spikes predictions. Nowadays, short-term forecasts have become increasingly important since the rise of the competitive spot electricity markets. A two-layered model is introduced for forecasting 7-days ahead hourly electricity price values of electricity spot market. Due to the importance of improved analysis of spikes for risk management, price segmentation into normal range and price spike module is applied. Price spike module consists of two segments: obtaining the probability of price spike occurrence and predicting the value of price spike. To avoid reliance on a single classifier, the compound classifier is proposed in the paper, which combines three individual classification methods: a support vector machine (SVM) classification, decision trees (DT) and probabilistic artificial neural network (PANN). The k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is applied for the price spike value prediction. © 2015 IEEE.",Classification algorithms; Electricity price forecast; Nearest neighbor searches; Price spikes; Wavelet coefficients,Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Forecasting; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Risk assessment; Risk management; Support vector machines; Classification algorithm; Classification methods; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity spot market; Price spike; Spot electricity market; Wavelet coefficients; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Filho J.C.R., Affonso C.M., De Oliveira R.C.L.",Energy price classification in North Brazilian market using decision tree,2015,4.0,"This paper proposes a short-term energy price classification model using decision tree. The proposed model does not predict the exact value of future electricity price, but the class to which it belongs, established with respect to pre-specified threshold. This strategy is proposed since for some applications, the exact value of future prices is not required for the decision-making process. A feature selection technique is applied to identify the relevant attributes to the decision tree. Some decision tree algorithms are investigated such as CART and C5.0. These results are compared with NN, another classification technique commonly used. In addition, ensemble models combining CART, C5.0 and NN two by two are analyzed. The prediction time horizon is 1 week ahead and the system used is the Brazilian market, which adopts a cost-based centralized dispatch with unique characteristics of price behavior. The results show that an ensemble model of C5.0 and CART produced high accuracy of 99.3%, and can be an attractive tool to mitigate risks in purchasing power. © 2015 IEEE.",classification; decision tree; electricity price forecasting; feature selection,Algorithms; Classification (of information); Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Power markets; Classification models; Classification technique; Decision making process; Decision-tree algorithm; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Prediction time horizon; Selection techniques; Data mining,Conference Paper
Nowakowska L.,Dynamic discrete model for electricity price forecasting,2015,4.0,"Price in the wholesale energy markets is established by matching supply (what generators want to sell) and demand (what utilities and customers want to buy). Developing the proper pricing strategies is becoming increasingly relevant to producers and consumers in the new competitive electric power markets. Price-forecasting tools are essential for all market participants for their survival under new deregulated environment. The goal of this paper is to construct a discrete dynamic model which can be used to forecast energy price in this kind of market. This mathematical model consists of four recursive, first-order equations describing current demand, forecasted demand and amount of energy being produced by generators. Based on this model the price for the next period can be calculated. The basic concepts such as changes of supply and demand and their influence on the market are firstly listed and described.

"Lebedev D., Rosin A.",Practical use of the energy management system with day-ahead electricity prices,2015,4.0,"Our goal was to define a possible profit resulting from the use of batteries as an electric energy storage (EES) device in apartment buildings or small houses as typical households. Focus was on the theoretical and practical studies of an energy management system (EMS) and financial analysis of investments return. Use of a battery bank charge-discharge-schedule (BCDS) allows an optimal operation of EES. The benefits lie in importing and storing more energy at low price periods while decreasing the imported power from the grid at high price periods and dispatching the stored energy for load demands. The BCDS is optimized by help of the price and load forecast, at the same time guaranteeing load demand supply. Nord Pool Spot day-ahead market provides all required data for the EMS to evaluate the cost of imported energy in each period of time. The optimization algorithm creates the best BCDS to bring the highest profit to the end customer.

Sapio A.,The impact of renewables on electricity prices and congestion in a regime switching model: Evidence from the italian grid,2015,4.0,"In this paper, the cross-zonal impact of renewable energy (RE) on electricity prices is assessed by means of a time-varying regime switching model, focusing on the highly congested line connecting Sicily with the Italian peninsula. In the base regime, there is no congestion and the price in Sicily (which equals the systemmarginal price) depends on national electricity demand and RE supply. In the congested regime, the Sicilian price depends on the local electricity demand and RE supply, as well as on market power by local generators. The transition between regimes is modeled through a dynamic probit, including, as explanatory variables, the RE supply on both sides of the potentially congested line. The regime switching model is estimated using hourly data from the Italian dayahead electricity market for the year 2012. As shown by results, congestion is determined by the total amount of renewables in mainland Italy, but when the RE supply is disaggregated into different sources, one finds that congestion is mainly due to photovoltaics (from the peninsula) and hydropower (wherever located), whereas wind power has a negative effect on congestion regardless of localization. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,Commerce; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Photovoltaic effects; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Electricity demands; Electricity prices; Explanatory variables; Italian day-ahead electricity markets; Italian peninsula; Regime switching model; Renewable energies; System marginal price; Stochastic models,Conference Paper

Load and Price Forecasting are two such important tools in the electricity market that help in performing essential tasks such as unit commitment of generating capacity, resource planning, cash flow analysis for stakeholders etc. This paper presents a new ANN model for hourly load and price forecasting. Since there are variations in demand throughout the day, a model needs to be devised to predict these variations.

"Wang J., Xiao L., Shi J.",The combination forecasting of electricity price based on price spikes processing: A case study in South Australia,2014,4.0,"Electricity price forecasting holds very important position in the electricity market. Inaccurate price forecasting may cause energy waste and management chaos in the electricity market. However, electricity price forecasting has always been regarded as one of the largest challenges in the electricity market because it shows high volatility, which makes electricity price forecasting difficult. This paper proposes the use of artificial intelligence optimization combination forecasting models based on preprocessing data, called ""chaos particles optimization (CPSO) weight-determined combination models."" These models allow for the weight of the combined model to take values of [-1,1]. In the proposed models, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is used to identify outliers, and the outliers are replaced by a new data-produced linear interpolation function. The proposed CPSO weight-determined combination models are then used to forecast the projected future electricity price. In this case study, the electricity price data of South Australia are simulated. The results indicate that, while the weight of the combined model takes values of [-1,1], the proposed combination model can always provide adaptive, reliable, and comparatively accurate forecast results in comparison to traditional combination models. © 2014 Jianzhou Wang et al.",,,Article
"Yang Y., Dong Y., Chen Y., Li C.","Intelligent optimized combined model based on GARCH and SVM for forecasting electricity price of New South Wales, Australia",2014,4.0,"Daily electricity price forecasting plays an essential role in electrical power system operation and planning. The accuracy of forecasting electricity price can ensure that consumers minimize their electricity costs and make producers maximize their profits and avoid volatility. However, the fluctuation of electricity price depends on other commodities and there is a very complicated randomization in its evolution process. Therefore, in recent years, although large number of forecasting methods have been proposed and researched in this domain, it is very difficult to forecast electricity price with only one traditional model for different behaviors of electricity price. In this paper, we propose an optimized combined forecasting model by ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) based on the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and support vector machine (SVM) to improve the forecasting accuracy. First, both GARCH model and SVM are developed to forecast short-term electricity price of New South Wales in Australia. Then, ACO algorithm is applied to determine the weight coefficients. Finally, the forecasting errors by three models are analyzed and compared. The experiment results demonstrate that the combined model makes accuracy higher than the single models. © 2014 Yi Yang et al.",,,Article

Firstly several single models were built to forecast the electricity price separately. Then the validation errors from every individual model were transformed into two discrete sequences: an emission sequence and a state sequence to build the HMM, obtaining a transmission matrix and an emission matrix, representing the forecasting ability state of the individual models. The combining weights of the individual models were decided by the state transmission matrixes in HMM and the best predict sample ratio of each individual among all the models in the validation set. The individual forecasts were averaged to get the combining forecast with the weights obtained above. The residuals of combining forecast were calibrated by the possible error calculated by the emission matrix of HMM.

The choice of the underlying process is crucial for the simulation outcome. For power plants the core question is the existence of stable long-term cointegration relations. Therefore we investigate the impacts of different ways to model price movements in a portfolio selection model for the German electricity market. Three different approaches of modelling fuel prices are compared: initially, all prices are modelled as correlated random walks. Thereafter the coal price is modelled as random walk. The gas price follows the coal price through a mean-reversion process. Lastly, all prices are modelled as mean reversion processes with correlated residuals. The prices of electricity base and peak futures are simulated using historical correlations with gas and coal prices. Yearly base and peak prices are transformed into an estimated price duration curve followed by the steps power plant dispatch, operational margin and net present value calculation and finally the portfolio selection.

Real-time balancing power is usually provided through various market solutions and thus, the prices on such markets will be affected by the increase in wind power production. Consequently, there exist a need for planning and simulation tools concerning the increased balancing demand. This paper therefore describes an estimation model for real-time balancing prices in systems where significant levels of wind power will be added.

"Gibescu M., Van Zwet E.W., Christie R.D., Kling W.L.",Optimal bidding strategy for mixed-portfolio producers in a dual imbalance pricing system,2008,4.0,"In this work we construct an optimal bidding strategy for an energy producer who owns a mixed portfolio of conventional fossil-fuelled plants and renewable resources of stochastic output such as wind farms. The energy market setup consists of a day-ahead spot, in combination with a dual-pricing imbalance market, as can be found e.g. in the Netherlands. A risk-neutral producer seeks to maximize the expectation of its random profit from conventional and renewable energy sales, under the predictive probability distributions of wind power production, day-ahead spot price and imbalance prices for surplus and deficit production. Our main result is a price-quantity curve, which the producer should submit in the day-ahead bidding process. This work builds upon our previous results on the optimal bidding curve of a wind producer alone. Here we show that pooling wind and conventional resources yields strictly higher expected revenues than separate operation. Essentially, the expensive fossil-fuelled units are used only as backup for wind energy shortages, while bidding from renewable sources becomes more aggressive in the presence of conventional back-up that can insulate from imbalance penalties. We validate this new method by computing and comparing yearly revenues for a mixed portfolio producer typical of the Netherlands, using data from the day-ahead market operated by the Amsterdam Power Exchange and the imbalance market run by the Dutch system operator TenneT.",Energy markets; Forecasting; Imbalance pricing; Optimization under uncertainty; Wind energy,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Day ahead market; Energy markets; Optimal bidding strategy; Optimization under uncertainty; Renewable energy sales; Renewable resource; Renewable sources; Wind power production; Power markets,Conference Paper

Because the transformer have a power efficiency of 92%, knowing the lost part of the power within 10 % needs input and output powers to be acquired within 4 %. Second, to validate the copper losses electrical representation of a smaller transformer, calorimetric measurements have been carried out.

"Thompson H.H., Jr., Wolf H.M.",Assessing the dollar price tag for meeting the nerc 10-minute reserve rule,1989,4.0,"The current operating guideline formulated by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) requires electric utilities to maintain enough online generation reserves to cover their “worst” generation and load contingency. To comply with this rule, most utilities carry enough 10-minute reserves to cover the loss of their largest generating resource (thermal unit, hydro unit, or purchase contract), and/or 5-10 percent uncertainty in their load forecast. With the current widespread emphasis on cost reduction, a question that has been asked by some utility management is: “What is the price tag for utilities to meet this NERC reserve rule?” This paper presents the results of a parametric study, recently performed for the Middle South Control Area, to quantify the cost of carrying short-term generation reserves. © 1989 IEEE",Generation cost; operational planning; reliability; short-term; spinning reserve; ten-minute reserve,Electric Power Generation--Costs; Electric Power Plants--Standby Service; Electric Utilities--Operations Research; Load Contingency; Operational Planning; Power Generation Reliability; Short-Term Power Generation Reserves; Spinning Reserve; Ten-Minute Reserve; Electric Power Systems,Article

Nevertheless, due to its non-linearity and non-stationarity, the trend of the price is usually complicated to predict. On the other hand, the accuracy of short-term electricity price and load forecasting is fundamental for an efficient management of electric systems. An accurate prediction can benefit future plans and economic operations of the power systems’ operators. In this paper, a new and accurate combined model has been proposed for short-term load forecasting and short-term price forecasting in deregulated power markets. It includes variational mode decomposition, mix data modeling, feature selection, generalized regression neural network and gravitational search algorithm. A mixed data model for the price and load forecast has been considered and integrated with the original signal series of price and load and their decomposition. Throughout this model, the candidate input variables are chosen by a distinct hybrid feature selection. Two reliable electricity markets (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland and Spanish electricity markets) have been used to test the proposed forecasting model and the obtained results have been compared with different valid benchmark prediction models.

This paper proposes a self-adaptive, decomposed, heterogeneous, and ensemble learning model for short-term electricity price forecasting one, two, and three-months-ahead in the Brazilian market. Exogenous variables, such as supply, lagged prices and demand are considered as inputs signals of the forecasting model. Firstly, the coyote optimization algorithm is adopted to tune the hyperparameters of complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition in the pre-processing phase. Next, three machine learning models, including extreme learning machine, gradient boosting machine, and support vector regression models, as well as Gaussian process, are designed with the intent of handling the components obtained through the signal decomposition approach with focus on time series forecasting. The individual forecasting models are directly integrated in order to obtain the final forecasting prices one to three-months-ahead. In this case, a grid of forecasting models is obtained. The best forecasting model is the one that has better generalization out-of-sample. The empirical results show the efficiency of the proposed model. Additionally, it can achieve forecasting errors lower than 4.2% in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error. The ranking of importance of the variables, from the smallest to the largest is, lagged prices, demand, and supply.

"Morstyn T., Teytelboym A., Hepburn C., McCulloch M.D.",Integrating P2P Energy Trading with Probabilistic Distribution Locational Marginal Pricing,2020,3.0,"This paper proposes a new local energy market design for distribution systems, which integrates peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and probabilistic locational marginal pricing. Distribution locational marginal pricing and P2P energy trading have each been proposed as potential alternatives to traditional retail pricing, to improve coordination between prosumers with distributed energy resources. Unidirectional locational pricing provides a scalable approach for coordinating demand, considering constraints and losses; while P2P energy trading allows prosumers to negotiate mutually beneficial bilateral energy transactions that increase the utilisation of their flexible energy resources. This paper proposes a market design combining the benefits of these two strategies. First, a new strategy for day-ahead locational marginal pricing is developed, which manages the uncertainty associated with local generation, demand and upstream prices by introducing a spread between the prices charged for energy imports and paid for energy exports. Then, local P2P energy trading platforms are integrated to additionally enable direct prosumer-to-prosumer trading, with transaction fees penalising energy transfers according to probabilistic differential locational marginal prices. Case studies are presented for a multi-phase low voltage distribution network, showing how the design can create value for prosumers, and the system as a whole, by reducing the curtailment of renewable generation. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Distribution locational marginal pricing; distribution system operator; local energy market; peer-to-peer energy trading; point estimate method; transactive energy,Costs; Energy resources; Energy transfer; Location; Peer to peer networks; Probability distributions; Voltage distribution measurement; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution systems; Locational marginal prices; Locational marginal pricing; Locational pricing; Low voltage distribution network; Probabilistic distribution; Renewable generation; Power markets,Article
"Zhang F., Fleyeh H.",Short term electricity spot price forecasting using catboost and bidirectional long short term memory neural network,2019,3.0,"Electricity price forecasting plays a crucial role in liberalized electricity markets. Generally speaking, short term electricity price forecasting is essential for electricity providers to adjust the schedule of production in order to balance consumers' demands and electricity generation. Short term forecasting results are also utilized by market players to decide the timing of purchasing or selling to gain maximized profit. Among existing forecasting approaches, neural networks are regarded as the state of art method. However, deep neural networks are not studied comprehensively in this field, thus the motivation of this study is to fill this research gap. In this paper, a novel hybrid approach is proposed for short term electricity price forecasting. To be more specific, categorical boosting (Catboost) algorithm is used for feature selection and a bidirectional long short term memory neural network (BDLSTM) serves as the main forecasting engine.

"Chen Y., Marron J.S., Zhang J.",Modeling seasonality and serial dependence of electricity price curves with warping functional autoregressive dynamics1,2019,3.0,"Electricity prices are high dimensional, serially dependent and have seasonal variations. We propose a Warping Functional AutoRegressive (WFAR) model that simultaneously accounts for the cross time-dependence and seasonal variations of the large dimensional data. In particular, electricity price curves are obtained by smoothing over the 24 discrete hourly prices on each day. In the functional domain, seasonal phase variations are separated from level amplitude changes in a warping process with the Fisher–Rao distance metric, and the aligned (season-adjusted) electricity price curves are modeled in the functional autoregression framework. In a real application, the WFAR model provides superior out-of-sample forecast accuracy in both a normal functioning market, Nord Pool, and an extreme situation, the California market. The forecast performance as well as the relative accuracy improvement are stable for different markets and different time periods. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2019.",Karcher mean; Seasonal functional time series; Warping function,,Article
"Bento P., Nunes H., Pombo J., do Rosário Calado M., Mariano S.",Daily operation optimization of a hybrid energy system considering a short-term electricity price forecast scheme,2019,3.0,"The scenario where the renewable generation penetration is steadily on the rise in an increasingly atomized system, with much of the installed capacity “sitting” on a distribution level, is in clear contrast with the “old paradigm” of a natural oligopoly formed by vertical structures. Thereby, the fading of the classical producer–consumer division to a broader prosumer “concept” is fostered. This crucial transition will tackle environmental harms associated with conventional energy sources, especially in this age where a greater concern regarding sustainability and environmental protection exists. The “smoothness” of this transition from a reliable conventional generation mix to a more volatile and “parti-colored"" one will be particularly challenging, given escalating electricity demands arising from transportation electrification and proliferation of demand-response mechanisms. In this foreseeable framework, proper Hybrid Energy Systems sizing, and operation strategies will be crucial to dictate the electric power system’s contribution to the “green” agenda.

We extend the Student’s t and the exponential generalised beta distribution of the second kind stochastic location and stochastic seasonal DCS models. We consider the generalised t distribution as an alternative for the error term and also consider dynamic specifications of volatility. We use a unique dataset of spot electricity prices for El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama. We consider two data windows for each country, which are defined with respect to the liberalisation and development process of the energy market in Central America. We study the identification of a wide range of DCS specifications, likelihood-based model performance, time-series components of energy prices, maximum likelihood parameter estimates, the discounting property of conditional score, and out-of-sample forecast performance. Our main results are the following. (i) We determine the most robust models of energy prices, with respect to parameter identification, from a wide range of DCS specifications. (ii) For most of the cases, the in-sample statistical performance of DCS is superior to that of the standard model.

Ten minutes averaged wind data are obtained from LIDAR over the period of twelve months and it is compared with the 38 years' data from weather station with the objective of determining the wind resources at the wind-farm. The performance of one of the wind turbines located in the wind-farm is assessed by comparing the wind power potential of the wind turbine with its actual power production. Our analysis shows that the wind farm under study is rated as 'good' in terms of wind power production and has wind power density of 479 W/m2. The annual wind-farm's income is estimated based on the real-data collected from the wind turbines. The effect of price of electricity and the spot prices of Norwegian-Swedish green certificate on the income will be illustrated by means of a Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) approach.

"Chen Y., Li M., Yang Y., Li C., Li Y., Li L.",A hybrid model for electricity price forecasting based on least square support vector machines with combined kernel,2018,3.0,"With the continuous development of the global electricity market, the electricity market needs the electricity price forecasting result to be accurate, and electricity price forecasting also has more profound practical significance. Accurate price forecasting can not only better reflect the operation of the electricity market but also help to make better decisions about the electricity market. However, the electricity price is affected by a variety of uncertain subjective and objective factors, as well as the constraints of the power system, making it more difficult to obtain accurate electricity price forecasting than electricity load forecasting. The kernel function occupies a very important position in a support vector machine (SVM), which is the key to the mature development of SVM theory. When using SVM for classification and regression, the appropriate kernel function is the basis and precondition for obtaining better classification and approximation effects. In this paper, a new combinatorial kernel function that combines RBF and UKF kernel functions is proposed and is applied to a least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and based on this, a new hybrid model empirical mode (EMD)-Mixed-LSSVM is proposed to forecast electricity price. The hybrid model puts the electricity price data after the noise reduction by the EMD into the LSSVM with the combined kernel function for calculation. In this paper, we forecast the electricity price in Australia and compare the results of EMD-Mixed-LSSVM with other methods. The results show that EMD-Mixed-LSSVM can effectively improve the accuracy of electricity price forecasting. © 2018 Author(s).",,Commerce; Electric industry; Electric machine theory; Forecasting; Noise abatement; Support vector machines; Approximation effects; Combined kernel function; Continuous development; Electricity load forecasting; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Least square support vector machines; Least squares support vector machines; Power markets,Article
"Ugurlu U., Tas O., Kaya A., Oksuz I.",The financial effect of the electricity price forecasts' inaccuracy on a hydro-based generation company,2018,3.0,"Electricity price forecasting has a paramount effect on generation companies (GenCos) due to the scheduling of the electricity generation scheme according to electricity price forecasts. Inaccurate electricity price forecasts could cause important loss of profits to the suppliers. In this paper, the financial effect of inaccurate electricity price forecasts on a hydro-based GenCo is examined. Electricity price forecasts of five individual and four hybrid forecast models and the ex-post actual prices are used to schedule the hydro-based GenCo using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). The financial effect measures of profit loss, Economic Loss Index (ELI) and Price Forecast Disadvantage Index (PFDI), as well as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the models are used for comparison of the data from 24 weeks of the year. According to the results, a hybrid model, 50% Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-50% Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), has the best performance in terms of financial effect. Furthermore, the forecast performance evaluation methods, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), are not necessarily coherent with inaccurate electricity price forecasts' financial effect measures. © 2018 by the authors.",Electricity price forecasting; Hydro-based generation company; Mixed integer linear programming; Profit loss; Self-scheduling,Finance; Forecasting; Integer programming; Long short-term memory; Losses; Profitability; Scheduling; Electricity generation; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast performance; Generation companies; Mean absolute error; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming (MILP); Self-scheduling; Power markets,Article
"Escribano A., Sucarrat G.",Equation-by-equation estimation of multivariate periodic electricity price volatility,2018,3.0,"Electricity prices are characterised by strong autoregressive persistence, periodicity (e.g. intraday, day-of-the week and month-of-the-year effects), large spikes or jumps, GARCH and – as evidenced by recent findings – periodic volatility. We propose a multivariate model of volatility that decomposes volatility multiplicatively into a non-stationary (e.g. periodic) part and a stationary part with log-GARCH dynamics. Since the model belongs to the log-GARCH class, the model is robust to spikes or jumps, allows for a rich variety of volatility dynamics without restrictive positivity constraints, can be estimated equation-by-equation by means of standard methods even in the presence of feedback, and allows for Dynamic Conditional Correlations (DCCs) that can – optionally – be estimated subsequent to the volatilities. We use the model to study the hourly day-ahead system prices at Nord Pool, and find extensive evidence of periodic volatility and volatility feedback. We also find that volatility is characterised by (positive) leverage in one third of the hours, and that a DCC model provides a better fit of the conditional correlations than a Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",ARCH; Dynamic conditional correlations; Electricity prices; Exponential GARCH; Financial return; Leverage; Log-GARCH; Multivariate GARCH; Nord Pool; Volatility,Arches; Economics; Energy resources; Dynamic conditional correlations; Electricity prices; Exponential GARCH; Financial returns; Leverage; Log-GARCH; Multivariate GARCH; Nord Pool; Volatility; Costs; correlation; electricity; estimation method; multivariate analysis; numerical model; price dynamics; regression analysis,Article
"Cross J., Nguyen B.H.",Time varying macroeconomic effects of energy price shocks: A new measure for China,2018,3.0,"In this paper, we examine the effects of world energy price shocks on China's macroeconomy over the past two decades. We begin by showing that the use of oil prices as a proxy for more general energy price dynamics is not appropriate for the case of China. Having established this fact, we propose a new energy price index which accurately reflects the structure of China's energy expenditure shares, and intertemporal fluctuations in international energy prices. We then employ a sufficiently rich set of time varying VARs, identified through a new set of agnostic sign restrictions, to estimate the effects of energy price shocks on China's macroeconomy. Our main result is that positive energy price shocks generate statistically significant reductions in real GDP growth and increases in inflation. Interestingly, both the sets of responses have consistently declined over the sample period. Next, the interest rate responses are found to be consistently positive over the sample period. Given the aforementioned stagflation result, this suggests that the PBOC is more focused on inflation stabilization as compared to facilitating output growth. All presented results are shown to be robust under both official national data and those developed by Chang et al. (2015), thus strengthening our conclusion that energy price shocks have significant time varying effects on China's macroeconomy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",China; Energy prices; Sign restrictions; Stochastic volatility; Time varying parameters,Economic analysis; Stochastic systems; China; Energy prices; Sign restrictions; Stochastic volatility; Time varying parameter; Costs; energy market; expenditure; Gross Domestic Product; inflation; interest rate; macroeconomics; oil supply; parameterization; price dynamics; stochasticity; China,Article
"Vendries Algarin J., Hawkins T.R., Marriott J., Khanna V.",Effects of Using Heterogeneous Prices on the Allocation of Impacts from Electricity Use: A Mixed-Unit Input-Output Approach,2017,3.0,"Economic input-output life cycle assessment (IO-LCA) models allow for quick estimation of economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with goods and services. IO-LCA models are usually built using economic accounts and differ from most process-based models in their use of economic transactions, rather than physical flows, as the drivers of supply-chain GHG emissions. GHG emissions estimates associated with input supply chains are influenced by the price paid by consumers when the relative prices between individual consumers are different. We investigate the significance of the allocation of GHG emissions based on monetary versus physical units by carrying out a case study of the U.S. electricity sector. We create parallel monetary and mixed-unit IO-LCA models using the 2007 Benchmark Accounts of the U.S. economy and sector specific prices for different end users of electricity. This approach is well suited for electricity generation because electricity consumption contributes a significant share of emissions for most processes, and the range of prices paid by electricity consumers allows us to explore the effects of price on allocation of emissions. We find that, in general, monetary input-output models assign fewer emissions per kilowatt to electricity used by industrial sectors than to electricity used by households and service sectors, attributable to the relatively higher prices paid by households and service sectors. This fact introduces a challenging question of what is the best basis for allocating the emissions from electricity generation given the different uses of electricity by consumers and the wide variability of electricity pricing. © 2016 by Yale University",energy accounting; environmental input-output analysis; industrial ecology; input-output life cycle assessment (IO-LCA); mixed-unit input-output model; physical input-output tables (PIOT),Costs; Economics; Electric power utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Supply chains; Energy accounting; Environmental input-output analysis; Industrial ecology; Input output model; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Physical input output table; Electric power generation; commodity price; electricity; electricity generation; emission inventory; energy market; energy use; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; input-output analysis; model; United States,Article
"Nowakowska L., Lis K.",Electricity price forecasting as optimization problem using discrete dynamic model,2017,3.0,"Deregulation of wholesale energy markets has brought many challenges and one of them is the accuracy of price forecasting methods. In the environment where price is set not only by matching supply (generation side) and demand (utilities and customer side) but is also influenced by various factors such as capacity, ancillary services and transmission congestion, the most popular forecasting tools are performing poorly. Developing the proper pricing strategies is becoming increasingly important to all market participants in the competitive electric power markets. The goal of this paper is to present a price - forecasting method which uses optimized set of parameters to predict the price for the next hour. The model consists of an objective function describing the minimum difference between real price for current hour and forecasted price for the same hour. It is constrained by four equations describing current demand, supply, price and also its forecasted values. The whole system comprised of dynamic discrete model of which fundamentals are described by the author in the previous paper. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated with real data from the Californian ISO day-ahead energy market. The proposed method provides significant innovation in area of price - forecasting tools and is characterized as new approach compared to most popular techniques applied to energy markets. © 2017 IEEE.",Day-ahead electricity market; Dynamic discrete model; Optimization; Price forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Optimization; Day-ahead electricity market; Day-ahead energy markets; Discrete dynamic models; Discrete modeling; Electricity price forecasting; Price forecasting; Transmission congestion; Wholesale energy market; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Filho J.C.R., Tiwari A., Dwivedi C.",Understanding the Drivers of Negative Electricity Price Using Decision Tree,2017,3.0,"This paper proposes a hybrid approach, integrating Decision Trees (DT) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for energy price classification in deregulated electricity market. The proposed model does not aim to predict future values of energy prices, but classify and explain the negative Locational Marginal Price (LMP) that are observed in the grid. The negative LMPs are grouped by the K-means technique and then taken as a target. Starting from a large set of potential variables that influence the price of energy, a feature selection technique is applied to identify the most relevant attributes in pricing. The C5.0 and ANN algorithms are used for classification. The California ISO market is used as a test system to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results show that an ensemble model of C5.0 and ANN produced high accuracy, and can be an interesting tool to explain the occurrence of negative prices. © 2017 IEEE.",Classification; Decision tree; Electricity price; Feature selection; LMP; Multilayer perceptron,Classification (of information); Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Deregulation; Feature extraction; Multilayer neural networks; Neural networks; California ISO; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity prices; Ensemble modeling; Hybrid approach; K-means technique; Locational marginal prices; Selection techniques; Data mining,Conference Paper

"Yan X., Song Y., Chowdhury N.A.",Performance evaluation of single SVM and LSSVM based forecasting models using price zones analysis,2016,3.0,"According to the current electricity price forecasting studies, it was very difficult to conclude whether support vector machine (SVM) or least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is more suitable in solving highly non-linear regression problems with very large time horizon such as mid-term electricity market clearing price (MCP) forecasting. In this paper, a detailed evaluation process using price zones analysis technique is applied in evaluating single SVM and single LSSVM based mid-term electricity MCP forecasting models. Based on much more detailed performance evaluation results and consideration of requirements for machine learning techniques utilizing in longer time horizon and highly nonlinear questions, the proposed paper concluded that SVM is more suitable than LSSVM in mid-term electricity MCP forecasting.

"Ergemen Y.E., Haldrup N., Rodríguez-Caballero C.V.",Common long-range dependence in a panel of hourly Nord Pool electricity prices and loads,2016,3.0,"Equilibrium electricity spot prices and loads are often determined simultaneously in a day-ahead auction market for each hour of the subsequent day. Hence daily observations of hourly prices take the form of a periodic panel rather than a time series of hourly observations. We consider novel panel data approaches to analyse the time series and the cross-sectional dependence of hourly Nord Pool electricity spot prices and loads for the period 2000–2013. Hourly electricity prices and load data are characterized by strong serial long-range dependence in the time series dimension in addition to strong seasonal periodicity, and along the cross-sectional dimension, i.e. the hours of the day, there is a strong dependence which necessarily has to be accounted for in order to avoid spurious inference when focusing on the time series dependence alone. The long-range dependence is modelled in terms of a fractionally integrated panel data model and it is shown that both prices and loads consist of common factors with long memory and with loadings that vary considerably during the day. Due to the competitiveness of the Nordic power market the aggregate supply curve approximates well the marginal costs of the underlying production technology and because the demand is more volatile than the supply, equilibrium prices and loads are argued to identify the periodic power supply curve. The estimated supply elasticities are estimated from fractionally co-integrated relations and range between 0.5 and 1.17 with the largest elasticities being estimated during morning and evening peak hours. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity prices and loads; Fractional integration; Long memory; Panel data models,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Elasticity; Electric power systems; Stochastic systems; Time series; Cross sectional dependence; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Fractional integration; Long memory; Long range dependence; Panel data models; Production technology; Power markets; competitiveness; electricity industry; electricity supply; energy market; panel data; price dynamics,Article
"Schneider I., Roozbehani M.",Endogenous error pricing for energy imbalance settlements,2016,3.0,"This paper models the bidding behavior of energy market participants under an endogenous imbalance pricing mechanism. Wind producers are increasingly required to settle their day-ahead electricity bids based on their actual production in real-time, which impacts their bidding behavior and curtailment decisions. The real-time price that players pay or receive in order to settle their deviations is based on the realized forecast errors in wind and demand, so it is affected by the strategies of all wind producers in the market. We formulate a two-stage game where players place ex-ante bids for energy production and then may curtail their realized output in real-time. Then, we find the subgame perfect equilibrium strategy for producer bidding and curtailment. Profit-maximizing bids are equal to the expected value of players' post-curtailment production values. The results show that the endogenous pricing mechanism leads to better tradeoffs of system efficiency and risk compared to the case where penalties are exogenous. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,,Conference Paper
Hreinsson E.B.,Optimal long term hydro scheduling linked to average electricity market prices,2016,3.0,"Traditionally, the Icelandic, island, hydro-based power system has been scheduled and planned based on local, isolated demand of two types: General Demand (GD) and the flat, now dominating Energy Intensive Industry (EII) demand. Thus a local load profile determines the scheduled operation, perhaps causing underutilization of resources, and water spillage. This limited flexibility is built into an isolated system, but interruptible EII contracts have served to increase the utilization to better meet the variable resource inflow (Water, geothermal steam). However, an access to a larger market would mitigate and change radically this limitation. Therefore a model based estimate of possible benefits is all important, when considering a UK-Iceland HVDC submarine link. © 2016 IEEE.",,Commerce; Geothermal water resources; Water resources; Energy intensive industries; Geothermal steam; Hydro scheduling; Icelandics; Icelands; Isolated systems; Local loads; Model-based OPC; Power markets,Conference Paper
"He D., Chen W.-P.",A real-time electricity price forecasting based on the spike clustering analysis,2016,3.0,"This paper mainly focuses on the 5-minute resolution real-time price forecasting in New York electricity market. An accurate forecasting is regarded as a key to win the bidding in today's highly competitive electricity market. We propose a combination of support-vector machine (SVM) with self-organized map (SOM) to forecast the instance and magnitude of price spikes. The SVM is used for detecting the existence of the spike and the SOM is used to clustering the spike. To provide a price probability distribution for the spike values, the bagging mechanism is introduced to the SOM algorithm. A summer case study is presented to evaluate the proposed model. The result shows greatly potential of the proposed solution in the real applications. © 2016 IEEE.",electricity market; electricity price; NYISO; SOM; SVM,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Support vector machines; Clustering analysis; Competitive electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; NYISO; Real applications; Real-time price; Self-organized map; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Aghaebrahimi M.R., Taherian H.",Short-term price forecasting considering distributed generation in the price-sensitive environment of smart grids,2016,3.0,"In smart grids environment, all participants, including different load types, are able to utilize the network. Advances in measurement tools in these networks make it easy to move towards dynamic pricing and non-fixed electricity tariffs. In this environment, the forecasted electricity price is declared to wholesale and retail consumers via Advanced Measurement Instruments (AMI). Therefore, motivated by different factors such as optimizing the economic/environmental issues or increasing the reliability, the customers are able to react to prices and manage their consumption. This pattern of reaction brings about extensive changes in the load and price curves of the network. On the other hand, environmental concerns resulting from the use of fossil fuels have increased the exploitation of renewable energies. But, as the penetration of renewable energy sources increases, serious improvements and modifications for the existing electric grid are needed to accommodate and integrate these intermittent sources. In this paper, a hybrid model is presented for simultaneous short term forecasting of electricity prices considering Distributed Generation (DG) in the price-sensitive environment of smart grids. The proposed model combines the Support Vector Regression (SVR) network with an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) network, and it is capable of tracking customers' reaction to declared prices. This model is applied on the data of power markets of Nordpool regrion, Denmark, where the smart grids are very active. The results of short term price forecasting for a target day (1/1/2016) shows the accuracy of the model. © 2016 IEEE.",Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system; Distributed generation; Price-sensitive; Short-term price forecasting; Smart grids,Costs; Distributed power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS); Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Measurement instruments; Price sensitive; Renewable energy source; Short-term price forecasting; Smart grid; Support vector regression (SVR); Smart power grids,Conference Paper
"Luo C., Huang Y.-F., Gupta V.",Dynamic pricing and energy management strategy for EV charging stations under uncertainties,2016,3.0,"This paper presents a dynamic pricing and energy management framework for electric vehicle (EV) charging service providers. To set the charging prices, the service providers faces three uncertainties: the volatility of wholesale electricity price, intermittent renewable energy generation, and spatial-temporal EV charging demand. The main objective of our work here is to help charging service providers to improve their total profits while enhancing customer satisfaction and maintaining power grid stability, taking into account those uncertainties. We employ a linear regression model to estimate the EV charging demand at each charging station, and introduce a quantitative measure for customer satisfaction. Both the greedy algorithm and the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm are employed to derive the optimal charging prices and determine how much electricity to be purchased from the wholesale market in each planning horizon. Simulation results show that DP algorithm achieves an increased profit (up to 9%) compared to the greedy algorithm (the benchmark algorithm) under certain scenarios. Additionally, we observe that the integration of a low-cost energy storage into the system can not only improve the profit, but also smooth out the charging price fluctuation, protecting the end customers from the volatile wholesale market. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Sahay K.B.,One hour ahead price forecast of Ontario electricity market by using ANN,2015,3.0,"In restructured electricity markets, forecasting electricity parameters are most essential tasks & basis for any decision making. Forecasting price in competitive electricity markets is difficult for consumers and producers in order to plan their operations and to manage their price risk, and it also plays a key role in the economic optimization of the deregulated power industry. Accurate, short-term price forecasting is an essential instrument which provides crucial information for power producers and consumers to develop accurate bidding strategies in order to maximize their profit. In this paper artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in short-term price forecasting that is, the one hour ahead price forecast of the electricity market. A new artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to compute the forecasted price in Ontario electricity market using MATLAB R13b.

"Grossi L., Nan F.",Robust smooth transition threshold autoregressive models for electricity prices,2015,3.0,"In this paper we suggest the use of robust STAR (Smooth Transition AutoRegressive) processes to model and forecast electricity prices observed on deregulated markets. The robustness of the model is achieved by extending to time series the M-type estimator based on the polynomial weighting function first introduced for independent multivariate data. The robust M-STAR estimator can be considered as a generalization of the robust SETAR estimator [1], because in STAR processes the change from one regime to another is ruled by a smooth function rather than by a fixed threshold. The main advantage of estimating robust STAR models is the possibility to capture two very well-known stylized facts of electricity prices: nonlinearity produced by changes of regimes and the presence of sudden spikes due to inelasticity of demand. The forecasting performance of the model is assessed through an application to the Italian electricity market (IPEX). By means of prediction performance indexes and tests, robust and non-robust STAR models for electricity prices are compared. © 2015 IEEE.",Electricity prices; Extreme values; M-estimator; Nonlinear models; Smooth Transition AutoRegressive processes,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Estimation; Forecasting; Power markets; Auto regressive process; Electricity prices; Extreme value; M-estimators; Non-linear model; Power quality,Conference Paper

Kim M.-K.,A new approach to short-term price forecast strategy with an artificial neural network approach: Application to the nord pool,2015,3.0,"In new deregulated electricity market, short-term price forecasting is key information for all market players. A better forecast of market-clearing price (MCP) helps market participants to strategically set up their bidding strategies for energy markets in the short-term. This paper presents a new prediction strategy to improve the need for more accurate short-term price forecasting tool at spot market using an artificial neural networks (ANNs). To build the forecasting ANN model, a threelayered feedforward neural network trained by the improved Levenberg-marquardt (LM) algorithm is used to forecast the locational marginal prices (LMPs). To accurately predict LMPs, actual power generation and load are considered as the input sets, and then the difference is used to predict price differences in the spot market. The proposed ANN model generalizes the relationship between the LMP in each area and the unconstrained MCP during the same period of time. The LMP calculation is iterated so that the capacity between the areas is maximized and the mechanism itself helps to relieve grid congestion. The addition of flow between the areas gives the LMPs a new equilibrium point, which is balanced when taking the transfer capacity into account, LMP forecasting is then possible. The proposed forecasting strategy is tested on the spot market of the Nord Pool. The validity, the efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed approach are shown by comparing with time-series models. © 2015 The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.",Artificial neural network; Levenbergmarquardt algorithm; Locational marginal price; Nord pool; Short-term forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Feedforward neural networks; Lakes; Neural networks; Power markets; Artificial neural network approach; Deregulated electricity market; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Locational marginal prices; Nord pool; Short-term forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Three-layered feedforward neural networks; Forecasting,Article
"Kovacevic R.M., Wozabal D.",A semiparametric model for electricity spot prices,2014,3.0,"This article proposes a semiparametric single-index model for short-term forecasting day-ahead electricity prices. The approach captures the dependency of electricity prices on covariates, such as demand for electricity, amount of energy produced by intermittent sources, and weather-dependent variables. To obtain parsimonious models, principal component analysis is used for dimension reduction. The approach is tested on two data sets from different markets and its performance is analyzed in terms of fit, forecast quality, and computational efficiency. The results are encouraging, in that the proposed method leads to a good in-sample fit and performs well out-of-sample compared with four benchmark models, including a SARIMA model as well as a functional nonparametric regression approach recently proposed in the literature. © 2014 IIE.",Electricity markets; generalized linear models; price forecasting; single index models; statistical modeling,Electricity market; Generalized linear model; Price forecasting; Single index models; Statistical modeling; Costs; Forecasting; Principal component analysis; Electricity,Article
"Osório G.J.O., Matias J.C.O., Catalão J.P.S.",Hybrid evolutionary-adaptive approach to predict electricity prices and wind power in the short-term,2014,3.0,"Nowadays, with the new paradigm shift in the energy sector and the advent of the smart grid, or even with the mandatory imposition for a gradual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the renewable producers, namely the wind power producers are faced with the competitiveness and deregulated structure that characterizes the liberalized electricity market. In a liberalized electricity market, the most important signal for all market players corresponds to the electricity prices. In this sense, accurate approaches for short-term electricity prices prediction are needed, and also for short-term wind power prediction due to the increasing share of wind generation. Hence, this paper presents a new hybrid evolutionary-adaptive approach for wind power and electricity market prices prediction, in the short-term, based on mutual information, wavelet transform, evolutionary particle swarm optimization and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, tested on real case studies, proving its superiority in a comprehensive comparison with other approaches previously published in the scientific literature. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.",Evolutionary particle swarm optimization; Forecasting; Market prices; Neuro-fuzzy system; Wind power,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Wavelet transforms; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Comprehensive comparisons; Evolutionary particle swarm optimizations; Liberalized electricity market; Market price; Neurofuzzy system; Scientific literature; Short-Term wind power predictions; Smart power grids,Conference Paper
"Filho J.C.R., Affonso C.M., Oliveira R.C.L.",Energy price forecasting in the North Brazilian market using NN-ARIMA model and explanatory variables,2014,3.0,"This paper proposes a new hybrid approach for short-term energy price prediction. This approach combines ARIMA and NN models in a cascaded structure and uses explanatory variables. A two step procedure is applied. In the first step, the explanatory variables are predicted. In the second one, the energy prices are forecasted by using the explanatory variables prediction. The prediction time horizon is 12 weeks-ahead and is applied to the North Brazilian submarket, which adopts a cost-based model with unique characteristics of price behavior. The proposed strategy is compared with traditional techniques like ARIMA and NN and the results show satisfactory accuracy and good ability to predict spikes.

"Mori H., Nakano K.",Application of Gaussian process to locational marginal pricing forecasting,2014,3.0,"In this paper, a new method is proposed for Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) forecasting in Smart Grid. The marginal cost is required to supply electricity to incremental loads in case where a certain node increases power demands in a balanced power system. LMP plays an important role to maintain economic efficiency in power markets in a way that electricity flows from a low-cost area to high-cost one and the transmission network congestion is alleviated. The power market players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their desire is reflected. This paper presents the Gaussian Process (GP) technique that comes from the extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in a way that hierarchical Bayesian estimation is introduced to express the model parameter as the stochastic variables. The advantage is that the model accuracy of GP is better than others. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of ISONE(Independent System Operator New England) in USA. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Gaussian process; Hierarchical bayes model; Locational marginal price; Mahalanobis kernel; MAP estimation; Time series,Bayesian networks; Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Location; Power markets; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Time series; Adaptive systems; Gaussian Processes; Hierarchical Bayes models; Locational marginal prices; Mahalanobis; MAP estimation; Electric power transmission networks,Conference Paper
"Umamaheswari K., Somasundaram P.L.",Pricing framework for reactive power as ancillary service,2014,3.0,In restructured power market several ancillary services are developed for maintaining the secure operation of power system. The voltage stability is one of the major criteria for preserving system security. Structure of Competitive market for reactive power estimation is rising in recent trends. The reactive power is very essential for maintaining the voltage profile in transmission line. Thus the reactive power pricing and its estimation importance is focused in this paper. Here the cost function of reactive power is developed and calculated most accurately based on generator as reactive power source. This cost function for the generator is modified in some prescribed manner and it is implemented using optimal power flow in MATLAB. The proposed method is realized in IEEE 9 bus and IEEE 30-bus system. Thus it provides good support for the generator bidders and consumers for the accurate well deserved contracts with the use of calibrated reactive power pricing. © 2014 IEEE.,Optimal power flow (OPF); Reactive power pricing; Restructured power market,Acoustic generators; Commerce; Cost functions; Costs; Electric lines; Electric load flow; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Stability criteria; Ancillary service; Competitive markets; Operation of power system; Optimal power flows; Power estimations; Reactive power pricing; Restructured power markets; Voltage profile; Reactive power,Conference Paper
"Shcherbakova A., Kleit A., Blumsack S., Cho J., Lee W.",Effect of increased wind penetration on system prices in Korea's electricity markets,2014,3.0,"In this paper, we examine the effect of increased wind penetration on system marginal prices (SMPs) in South Korea's electricity market. Korea's renewable portfolio standard (RPS) went into effect in 2012, with a goal of increasing the share of renewable generation to 10% of the total load by 2022. We examine the output of wind installations across the Korean peninsula and simulate an increase in wind penetration consistent with Korea's RPS targets. Under a variety of assumptions on demand elasticity, we find that higher shares of wind generation in total supply reduce both the average SMP and its variation. In particular, we find that wind energy output on the Korean peninsula is more correlated with peak electricity demand than has been reported for other regions. The per-unit value of wind energy to owners of wind assets is thus higher for South Korea than would be the case for European or North American locations with a similar mix of fuels other than wind.

"Dekker G.W., Frunt J., De Boer W.W., Duvoort M.R.",Case studies and results of the E-Price approach in power systems,2013,3.0,"This paper presents the simulation results of a model for the validation of market designs and algorithms for power balancing. The simulations were performed as one of the final deliverables of the E-Price project. The market design under simulation includes the introduction of double sided markets for ancillary services for power balancing, in which balance responsible parties have the possibility to hedge their position in terms of energy balance. The model, which includes both day-ahead and real-time decisions, has been exposed to imbalances of three categories. These imbalances are power plant trips, wind power forecasting errors and wind power fluctuations. As such it is evaluated how the proposed power balancing mechanisms perform. The simulations show that the proposed double sided market for ancillary services gives proper incentives to balance responsible parties to minimize their imbalance as well as to provide available resources to the balancing systems in place. © 2013 IEEE.",Automatic Generation Control; Economic Dispatch; Power Markets; Unit Commitment,Ancillary service; Automatic generation control; Economic Dispatch; Power fluctuations; Power markets; Real-time decisions; Unit Commitment; Wind power forecasting; Scheduling; Wind power; Commerce,Conference Paper
"Nowotarski J., Tomczyk J., Weron R.",Modeling and forecasting of the long-term seasonal component of the EEX and Nord Pool spot prices,2013,3.0,"We present the results of a study on modeling and forecasting of the long-term seasonal component (LTSC) of electricity spot prices. We consider a vast array of models including linear regressions, monthly dummies, sinusoidal decompositions and wavelet smoothers. We find that in terms of forecasting EEX and Nord Pool spot prices up to a year ahead, wavelet-based models significantly outperform all considered piecewise constant and sine-based models. This result challenges the traditional approach to deseasonalize spot electricity prices by fitting monthly dummies or sinusoidal functions. We also find that extending the calibration window up to four years does not improve the results; two- and especially three-year windows lead to better spot price forecasts. © 2013 IEEE.",Electricity spot price; Forecasting; Monthly dummies; Seasonality; Sinusoidal decomposition; Wavelets,Electricity spot price; Modeling and forecasting; Piece-wise constants; Seasonality; Sinusoidal functions; Spot electricity prices; Traditional approaches; Wavelets; Commerce; Decomposition; Electricity; Forecasting; Lakes; Costs,Conference Paper
"Mody S., Steffen T.",Optimal charging of EVs in a real time pricing electricity market,2013,3.0,"The idea of grid friendly charging is to use electricity from the grid to charge batteries when electricity is available in surplus and cheap. There are several ways of achieving this, for example using droop control, using night time electricity tariffs, or using smart metering. The goal is twofold: to avoid putting additional load on the electricity grid and power generation, and to reduce the cost to the consumer. This paper looks at the saving potential when charging an electric car using real time tariffs provided by a smart meter, using the Ameren tariffs in Illinois as an example. If prices are known in advance (day-ahead pricing), the optimization only requires picking the cheapest time slots for charging the battery. Further savings can be made by using real time prices that are not known in advance, but the optimization problem then depends on price prediction models, and it becomes much more difficult to solve. This paper presents a simple suboptimal approach, and it quantifies the potential improvements that could be made using more sophisticated price predictions. The result is that cost savings in the order of about 50 USD (1/3 of the electricity costs) are feasible if a fast charger is used using real time pricing. The scale of the savings is such that complex optimization strategies are not worthwhile, and for the foreseeable future simple solutions are expected to be more cost effective.

Currently, there are many techniques available for short-term electricity market clearing price (MCP) forecasting, but very little has been done in the area of mid-term electricity MCP forecasting. Mid-term electricity MCP forecasting has become essential for resources reallocation, maintenance scheduling, bilateral contracting, budgeting and planning purposes.

"Hodge T., Dahl C.A.",Power marketer pricing behavior in the California Power Exchange,2012,3.0,"Various studies have examined whether market power abuses by independent electricity generators contributed to the demise of the California Power Exchange (PX). However, the behavior of wholesale power marketers has generally been overlooked. To fill this gap, our paper focuses on the pricing behavior of five major power marketers in the California PX during 2000: Duke Energy Trading & Marketing, Reliant Energy Services, Dynegy Power Marketing, Enron Power Marketing, and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading. Our unique data set, collected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during an investigation of energy market pricing manipulation, allows us to assess the level of market power using the conduct parameter pricing model. The estimated conduct parameter allows us to determine power marketer pricing behavior is competitive, Cournot, or collusive. Our results indicate that Duke Energy and Reliant were exercising market power when pricing the wholesale electricity they sold in the California PX during 2000. No statistical evidence was uncovered to show that the smaller marketers - Dynegy, Williams and, Enron - were setting prices at a level higher than those consistent with a competitive market. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity; Marketer; Power; Pricing; Wholesale,California; Competitive markets; Cournot; Data sets; Duke energies; Electricity generators; Energy markets; Energy services; Federal energy regulatory commissions; Market Power; Marketer; Power; Power exchange; Power marketing; Pricing models; Statistical evidence; Wholesale; Wholesale electricity; Williams; Williams energies; Commerce; Electric generators; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Electricity; Marketing; Costs; commodity price; electrical power; electricity generation; energy market; statistical analysis; California; United States,Article
"Mori H., Itagaki T.",An electricity price zone forecasting method with fuzzy inference net,2012,3.0,"This paper proposes a Fuzzy Inference Net (FIN) method for electricity price zone forecasting. Under smart grid environment, it is important for players to maximize profits and minimize risks though power markets while introducing renewable energy into grids. The time series of electricity price becomes more complicated due to the nonlinearity and uncertainties. To capture the behavior of the time series appropriately, more sophisticated methods are required to overcome them as a prediction tool. In this paper, a new method is proposed for price zone forecasting. The proposed method makes use of FIN that evaluates the association probability of unknown data to predetermined clusters with fuzzy inference and self-organization. The selection of input variables is determined by the variable importance of the CART algorithm of data mining. The association probability is used determine which zone the one-step ahead electricity price belong to.

"Gómez-Quiles C., Gil H.A.",Inference of electricity price depletion by wind power in Spain,2011,3.0,"Wind power is usually given priority in electricity markets by assigning a zero price to its expected output during the settlement process. The more wind power is to be incorporated into the market, the less number of conventional units of output will be required to supply the demand, resulting in an expected drop in electricity prices. Lower electricity prices are good in the long-term for all entities that buy electricity from the market and sell it back to consumers. When the prices drop to minimum levels, however, (a situation called here as price depletion) the profitability of some conventional generators necessary for the supply adequacy of the system in times of low wind power production may get compromised. This work uses a probabilistic model to estimate the role that wind power is playing in the price depletion situations sometimes observed in Spain. Evidence shows that it is a balanced combination of factors what leads to this circumstance. © 2011 IEEE.",Electricity Markets; Prices; Wind Power,Electricity market; Electricity prices; Prices; Probabilistic models; Supply adequacy; Wind power production; Commerce; Drops; Electric utilities; Electricity; Profitability; Wind power; Costs,Conference Paper
"Mohapatra A., Mallick M.K., Panigrahi B.K., Cui Z., Hong S.",A hybrid approach for short term electricity price and load forecasting,2011,3.0,"In a deregulated power industry, accurate short term load forecasting (STLF) and price forecasting (STPF) is a key issue in daily power market. The load forecasting helps in unit commitment as well as in economic scheduling of the generators. The price forecasting helps an electric utility to make important decisions like generation of electric power, bidding for generation, price switching and infrastructure development. Price forecasting is very much useful for energy suppliers, ISOs and other participants in electric generation, transmission and distribution. This paper presents a hybrid approach for the STLF and STPF. The time series data pertaining to load / price is decomposed into various decomposition levels by the use of Wavelet Transform (WT) and each level obtained by this process is predicted using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

"Menniti D., Scordino N., Sorrentino N.",Forecasting next-day electricity prices by a neural network approach,2011,3.0,"Forecasting short-term electricity market prices has been the focus of several studies in recent years. Although various approaches have been examined, achieving sufficiently low forecasting errors has not been always possible. However, certain applications, such as demand-side management, do not require exact values for future prices but utilize averages values as the basis for making short-term scheduling decisions. With the aim of enhancing the accuracy of the next-day electricity price forecasting, this paper proposes an approach to forecast the day-ahead electricity prices by means of n Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), based on the estimation of the mean prices of n blocks of hours, with n identified according to the values of correlation factors computed on the basis of field records of the Italian electricity market. Simulation results show that forecasting next-day prices on an hourly basis induces to an error which results worse than the one made when average prices are forecasted according to groups of hours. © 2011 IEEE.",,Correlation factors; Demand side managements; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Field record; Forecasting error; Short-term scheduling; Simulation result; Commerce; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Electric utilities; Electricity; Forecasting; Neural networks; Scheduling; Costs,Conference Paper

"Sun Y., Bansal R.C., Bhardwaj A.K., Srivastava A.K.",Electricity market price forecasting using support vector machines,2011,3.0,"Due to the electricity market deregulation, the techniques used for load forecasting have gradually improved over the years. Deregulation in the power system industry has caused rising requirement in planning, operating and controlling electric energy systems, which brings electricity load forecasting to a crucial level. Therefore, adequate techniques are desired for accurately predicting the load and hence assisting power companies in generating capacity scheduling, maintenance, energy planning and procurement, etc. An accurate forecast can greatly help power distribution companies to improve their electricity marketing strategies and avoid over or under unitisation of generating capacity and therefore optimises energy prices. But, to predict the load demand in real time requires a considerable amount of efforts. This paper presents a design methodology for a short term load forecasting useful for distribution companies, which are capable of interacting with users, gathering historical load data, performing a statistical analysis on the historical data and plotting graphs of the predicted load using the support vector machine (SVM). SVM is the chosen forecasting technique because many studies have concluded that SVMs produce the optimum accuracy as compared to other methods such as Naive Bayesian, but SVM has not been optimised for the domain. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",deregulation; load forecasting; short term load forecasting; STLF; support vector machine; SVM,,Article

The current researches on the electricity price forecasting focus on the analysis of unstable economic time series. However, due to the difference of the allocation of power resource and consumption in different regions, the time series of electricity consumption and sales price in a single region cannot contain all information in different regions. In view of the disadvantages of the time series, the panel data is introduced to investigate the long-term equilibrium relationship and the short-term adjustment relationship between electricity consumption and sales price in the paper. The fundamental and novel contribution of the paper is to apply the PC to forecast accurately in day-ahead energy market price.

"Montero J.-M., Fernández-Avilés G., García M.-C.",Estimation of Asymmetric Stochastic Volatility Models: Application to Daily Average Prices of Energy Products,2010,3.0,"Energy supply and demand, and as a consequence energy prices, are likely to represent one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century. Commodity markets exhibit increased volatility when there is little or no underutilized supply capability to meet natural fluctuations in demand. In the case of energy markets, the large capital requirements and significant lead times associated with energy production and delivery make them more susceptible to the imbalances in supply capability and demand. Energy price volatility has destructive impact on market agents, and this impact is intensified when the prices exhibit asymmetric volatility. This article pursues two aspects of the issue. First we consider general aspects, especially the asymmetric pattern of volatility of daily returns of different types of energy products. Then, we analyze the behaviour of daily returns by using traditional models of volatility that include AGARCH, TGARCH, EGARCH, and ARSV strategies, as well as a threshold asymmetric autoregressive stochastic volatility (TA-ARSV) model that we propose. The energy products considered in this analysis are probably the most relevant energy products for the economic activity of the nations and the economic relations between countries: Crude Oil (OPEC reference basket and London Brent index), Gasoline, Natural Gas, Butane, and Propane.

"Areekul P., Senju T., Toyama H., Chakraborty S., Yona A., Urasaki N., Mandal P., Saber A.Y.",A new method for next-day price forecasting for PJM electricity market,2010,3.0,"In the framework of the competitive electricity markets, electricity price forecasting is important for market participants in a deregulated electricity market. Rather than forecasting the value, market participants are sometimes more interested interval of the peak electricity price forecasting. Forecasting the peak price is essential for estimating the uncertainty involved in the price and thus is highly useful for making generation bidding strategies and investment decisions. The choice of the forecasting model becomes the important influence factor how to improve price forecasting accuracy. This paper proposes new approach to reduce the prediction error at occurrence time of the peak electricity price, and aims to enhance the accuracy of the next day electricity price forecasting. In the proposed method, the weekly variation data is used for input factors of the ANN at occurrence time of the peak electricity price in order to catch the price variation. Moreover, learning data for the ANN is selected by rough sets theory at occurrence time of the peak electricity price. This method is examined by using the data of the PJM electricity market. From the simulation results, it is observed that the proposed method provides a more accurate and effective forecasting, which helpful for suitable bidding strategy and risk management tool for market participants in a deregulated electricity market.

When grey GM (1, 1) model is used in forecast, the forecast error exceeded the permitted precision. This is because GM (1, 1) model is invalidated only if the price series did not follow the rule of exponential growth. In this case, grey model with period residual modification is proposed, which inherits the advantages of grey model and makes the forecasting price curve fluctuated. Meanwhile, a series of technology is used, such as smooth processing to original data, improvement of initial condition and period residual modification. Thus the fitting curve is closer to original data and the forecasting precision is improved.

The similar days parameters, i.e., time framework of similar days (d = 45 days) and number of selected similar price days (N = 5) are kept constant for all the simulated cases. Forecasting performance is carried out by choosing a day from each season of the year 2006 randomly, and for which, the NN parameters for the base case are considered as BP-set = 500, η = 0.8, α = 0.1 and dNN = 45 days. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the value of BP-set (500, 1000, 1500); η (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2), α (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and dNN (15, 30, 45 and 60 days). During the sensitivity analysis, the most favorable value of BP-set is first identified followed by that of η and α, and based on which the best value of dNN is determined. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the best value of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained when BP-set = 500, η = 0.8, α = 0.1 and dNN = 60 days for winter season, whereas for spring, summer and autumn, these values are 500, 0.6, 0.1 and 45 days, respectively. Results and discussions from real-world case study based on the PJM electricity market are presented. ©2009 IEEE.",Electricity market; Neural network parameters; Price forecasting; Sensitivity analysis; Similar days,Backpropagation learning; Best value; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Euclidean norm; Extended versions; Forecasting performance; Improving performance; Learning rates; Mean absolute percentage error; Neural network parameters; Price forecasting; Real-world; Similar day; Similar days; Weighted factors; Winter seasons; Backpropagation; Commerce; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission networks; Electricity; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Power transmission; Sensitivity analysis,Conference Paper
"Nguyen H.T., Nabney I.T.",Energy forward price prediction with a hybrid adaptive model,2009,3.0,"This paper presents a forecasting technique for forward electricity/gas prices, one day ahead. This technique combines a Kalman filter (KF) and a generalised autoregressive conditional heteroschedasticity (GARCH) model (often used in financial forecasting). The GARCH model is used to compute next value of a time series. The KF updates parameters of the GARCH model when the new observation is available. This technique is applied to real data from the UK energy markets to evaluate its performance. The results show that the forecasting accuracy is improved significantly by using this hybrid model. The methodology can be also applied to forecasting market clearing prices and electricity/gas loads. © 2009 IEEE.",,Adaptive models; Auto-regressive; Financial forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting techniques; Forward price; GARCH models; Hybrid model; Market Clearing Price; UK energy market; Artificial intelligence; Control theory; Technological forecasting; Time series; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper
"Mandal P., Srivastava A.K., Negnevitsky M., Park J.-W.",An effort to optimize similar days parameters for ANN based electricity price forecasting,2008,3.0,"This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of similar days (SD) parameters to increase the accuracy of artificial neural network (ANN) and SD based short-term price forecasting. Presented work is an extended version of previous works done by authors to integrate ANN and similar days method for predicting electricity price. Focus here is on sensitivity analysis of similar days parameters while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the PJM (regional transmission organization in north-east America) electricity market. Several cases are simulated by choosing: (a) two; (b) three; (c) four; and (d) five similar days parameters to calculate the norm. Additionally, sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing time framework of similar days (d=15, 30, 45, 60) and number of selected similar price days (N=5, 10). From sensitivity analysis, it is identified that the optimized mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained using case-c with d=30 and N=10. MAPE of reasonably small value along with forecast mean square error (FMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of around 2$/MWh and 1$/MWh are obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. Numerical results show that forecasts generated by developed ANN model based on the optimized case are accurate and efficient. © 2008 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Electricity market; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Price forecasting; Sensitivity analysis; Similar days parameters,Backpropagation; Correlation methods; Costs; Diffusers (optical); Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Artificial neural network; Electricity market; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Price forecasting; Similar days parameters; Sensitivity analysis,Conference Paper
"Li H.-D., Zhang J., Xiao L., Li H.-P., Feng Y.",Application of DS evidence theory in combined price forecasting,2008,3.0,"The method of combined forecasting establishes multiple forecasting models, and calculates the final results by summing up the weighted results of every model. However, it is hard to determine the weights of the combination. The weights of the combination are determined by the history predicted errors in the traditional method of combination. Since it does not take into account of the external environmental influencing factors in forecasting a point price, the historical predicted errors have impact on the forecasting result. Actually, the forecasting precision of different methods is influenced by the environmental factors directly. This paper discusses how to apply DS evidence theory into combined price forecasting with multiple models. The main framework of research is as follow: firstly, modeling data is used to train multiple models, which produces the model and training errors applied in price forecasting; secondly, training errors are converted into credibility of each model in predicting the point. Then, as an output value the credibility is outputted, while the environmental factors of this moment are input variables. As a result, credibility training and forecasting model is built up; thirdly, the environmental factors are regarded as objected input, and the built credibility forecasting model is used to forecast the credibility; fourthly, several models are used to forecast the price respectively; fifthly, DS evidential reasoning method is used to synthetically calculate conformity the credibility of each model, and the combined weight of each model is obtained; sixthly, the forecasted price of multiple models is combined with the predicted weight and the final price is obtained. Finally, a study case serves to analyze and compare combined price forecasting based on DS evidence theory with equally weighted average combined forecasting and variance-covariance optimized combined forecasting and the results illustrate that this model is valid. © 2008 DRPT.",Combined forecasting; Evidence theory; Power market; Price forecasting,Deregulation; Dielectric relaxation; Electric load forecasting; Errors; Industrial economics; Technology; Combined forecasting; D-S evidence theory; Environmental factors; Evidence theory; Evidential reasoning; External-; Forecasting models; Forecasting precision; Influencing factors; Input variables; International conferences; Modeling data; Multiple modeling; Power market; Power technologies; Price forecasting; Training errors; Weighted averaging; Forecasting,Conference Paper
"Hong L., Hao X., Weiguo L., Yi S., Guoyi X.",A power price forecasting method based on nonparametric GARCH model,2008,3.0,"Based on nonparametric conditional heteroscedasticity estimation theory, an improved power price forecasting method is proposed in this paper. In this method, according to the practical power price curve, conditional variance function is built and the model is determined by nonparametric estimation method. Besides, in the nonparametric estimation process, the iterative estimation algorithm is introduced to deal with the problem where conditional standard deviation is unpredictable. And the estimation credence of conditional variance function is improved by continually modifying the estimation value of conditional standard deviation as input variance. On the research of day-ahead time series fluctuation characteristics of power price in California in 2000, the time series of Humb node is modeled and forecasted.

"Kang C., Guo L., Bai L., Xu R., He J., Xu K.",Joint analysis of power system reliability and market price considering the uncertainties of load forecasts,2007,3.0,"Reliability evaluation plays an important role in power system planning and operation. In electricity market, the uncertainties of market price and load forecasting will also greatly affect system reliability. This paper presents a novel model and algorithm for joint analysis of power system reliability and market price considering the uncertainties of load forecasts. After a process of reliability evaluation and market simulation, the results include system reliability indices and the probability distribution function of price can be achieved. If the forecasting load is a certain value, the probability distribution of the market price, as well as Expected Value and Standard Deviation, can be obtained directly. Furthermore, a stochastic load model is established to describe the uncertainty of future system load. Taking the uncertainty of load forecasting into consideration, we can suppose the forecasting load to be a random variable. Under different load levels, the market price has different probability distributions. So, the full distribution is the weighted sum of each distribution. In this algorithm, units' uncertain bids and output are incorporated together as well as the probability of forecasting load. In order to show the efficiency of the proposed models and algorithms, two numerical samples are studied in details in this paper. A simple system which contains 4 units is analyzed firstly. The calculations of system reliability indices considering uncertain load forecasting are demonstrated within this example. Consequently, IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) composed of 32 units is utilized to simulate the real electricity market. The probability distribution of market price under different load levels are calculated and then depicted by figures. Through the study, the expectant unit output and its income are also analyzed and some instructive conclusions are yielded which are useful for the participants of the market. Based on these results, it is also possible to evaluate the risk involved by generating units when system load forecasting is uncertain. The sample studies indicate that the model established is efficient. © 2006 IEEE.",Electricity market; Electricity price; Power system; Probability distribution; Reliability evaluation; Uncertainty,Electricity market; Electricity price; Reliability evaluation; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Probability distributions; Reliability analysis; Stochastic models; Uncertainty analysis; Electric power systems,Conference Paper
"Wang Q., Dong Z., Li X., Zhao J., Wong K.P.",An effective approach to predicting electricity market price spikes,2007,3.0,"Electricity market price prediction is important for market participants. The most of the predicting techniques are designed for normal price predictions other than price spikes predictions. The aim of this paper is to analyse electricity market data including demand, price, and capacity reserve, to find out their causes to the occurrence of price spikes. The challenge of spike prediction is the accuracy of the prediction that is on how a classifier can capture all spikes that would happen. Particularly precision/recall is used in the evaluation of the spike prediction. It has shown that ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) algorithm has a superior performance in prediction of price spikes compared with other existing classification algorithms such as SVM (Support Vector Machine).

"Yoshikazu I., Shozo T.",Analysis of price changes in artificial double auction markets consisting of multi-agents using Genetic Programming for learning and its applications,2007,3.0,"In this paper, we show the analysis of price changes in artificial double auction markets consisting of multi-agents who learn from past experiences based on the Genetic Programming (GP) and its applications. For simplicity, we focus on the double auction in an electricity market. Agents in the market are allowed to buy or sell items (electricity) depending on the prediction of situations. Each agent has a pool of individuals (decision functions) represented in tree structures to decide bid price by using the past result of auctions. A fitness of each individual is defined by using successful bids and a capacity utilization rate of production units for a production of items, and agents improve their individuals based on the GP to get higher return in coming auctions. In simulation studies, changes of bid prices and returns of bidders are discussed depending on demand curves of customers and the weight between an average profit obtained by successful bids and the capacity utilization rate of production units. The validation of simulation studies is examined by comparing results with classical models and price changes in real double auction markets. Since bid prices bear relatively large changes, we apply an approximate method for a control by forcing agents stabilize the changes in bid prices. As a result, we see the stabilization scheme of bid prices in double auction markets is not realistic, then it is concluded that the market contains substantial instability.

"Karsaz A., Khaloozadeh H.",Medium term horizon market clearing price and load forecasting with an improved dual unscented Kalman filter,2007,3.0,"The deregulation of electric power supply industries has raised many challenging problems. One of the most important ones is forecasting the Market Clearing Price (MCP) of electricity. Decisions on various issues, such as to buy or sell electricity and to offer a transaction to the market, require accurate knowledge of the MCP. Another problem, which has also been an important issue of the traditional power systems, is load forecasting for both short and long terms. The extended kalman filter has been widely adopted for state estimation of nonlinear systems, machine learning applications and neural network training. In the EKF, the state distribution is approximated by the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. Therefore this can introduce large errors in the load and price forecasting as two Chaotic, nonstationary and nonlinear time-series. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF), in contrast, achieves third-order accuracy, by using a minimal set of MCP and load sigma points. In this paper an improved dual unscented Kalman filter (DUKF), which estimate state and parameter simultaneously has been applied to the real New England power market. The numerical stability and more accurate predictions of our method is comparable to the EKF, and traditional neural network training methods. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the DUKF is the same order as that of the EKE. The obtained results show significant improvement in both price and load forecasting. © 2007 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Deregulation; Electric power market; Load forecasting; Price prediction; Unscented filtering,Cost accounting; Deregulation; Electric power distribution; Marketing; Electric power market; Load forecasting; Price prediction; Neural networks,Conference Paper
"Benaouda D., Murtagh F.",Neuro-wavelet approach to time-series signals prediction: An example of electricity load and pool-price data,2007,3.0,"Accurate electricity load and pool-price forecasting can provide a set of vital predicted information that helps generation, transmission and retailer participating companies to bid strategically into a deregulated electricity market in order to maximize their profits and increase returns to their stakeholders. Although a number of forecasting methods have been proposed to solve the shortterm and long-term electricity load forecast, pool-price forecasting is a relatively new research area. In this article, we propose an autoregressive approach, based on a wavelet multiscale decomposition, for the prediction of one-hour ahead load and pool price based respectively on historical electricity load, and pool-price data. This approach is based on a multiple resolution decomposition of the signal using the redundant Haar à trous wavelet transform whose advantage is taking into account the asymmetric nature of the time-varying data. There is an additional computational advantage in that there is no need to re-compute the wavelet transform (wavelet coefficients) of the full signal if the electricity and pool price data (time series) is regularly updated. We assess results produced by this multiscale autoregressive method, in both linear and nonlinear variants, with single resolution autoregressive, multilayer perceptron, Elman recurrent neural network and the general regression neural network models. The input data consists of historical load and pool price data, which is collected over a period of 3 years (1999-2001), used for training, and 1 year (2002) used for testing. Experimental results are based on the New South Wales (Australia) electricity load and pool price data that is provided by the National Electricity Market Management Company.

The basis of Spot Rate Forecasts method is to assume that the market expectations implied by the current spot rate curve will be fulfilled, and heuristic representativeness characteristics are followed; this method has the capability to predict the following cycle of energy price under uncertainties (similar method in logically predicting future spot rate curve). The methodology of determining a rational redundancy level of power system equipment based on coordination among the total transfer capability (TTC) in the transmission system and the estimation of random equipment failures remain the same.

The European Electricity Market Matching Algorithm (EMMA) is currently based on Euphemia (Price Coupling of Regions), though there are several differences among countries across Europe. The new algorithm proposed uses market orders, which include aggregate hourly orders such as aggregate supply and demand curves. These orders are simple orders and the marginal price is affected by complex orders, especially by the minimum income condition (MIC) used in the Iberian Electricity Market and considered in our proposed algorithm.

"Yudantaka K., Kim J.-S., Song H.",Dual deep learning networks based load forecasting with partial real-time information and its application to system marginal price prediction,2019,2.0,"Load power forecast is one of most important tasks in power systems operation and maintenance. Enhancing its accuracy can be helpful to power systems scheduling. This paper presents how to use partial real-time temperature information in forecasting load power, which is usually done using past load power and temperature data. The partial real-time temperature information means temperature information for only part of the entire prediction time interval. To this end, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is trained using past temperature and load power data in order to forecast load power, where forecasted load power depends on the temperature prediction implicitly. Then, in order to deal with the case where nontrivial temperature prediction errors happen, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network is trained using the past data describing the relation between temperature variation and load power variation. Then, the temperature is measured at the beginning of the prediction time-interval and compensated load forecast is computed by adding the output of the LSTM and that of the MLP whose input is the temperature prediction error. It is shown that the proposed compensation using the real-time temperature information indeed improves performance of load power forecast. This improved load forecast is used to predict system marginal price (SMP). The proposed method is validated using the real temperature and load power data of South Korea. © 2019 by the authors.",Load forecast; LSTM (long short-term memory); MLP (multi-layer perceptron); SMP (system marginal price) forecast,Brain; Deep learning; Electric power plant loads; Information use; Long short-term memory; Load forecast; LSTM (long short-term memory); MLP (multilayer perceptron); Multi layer perceptron; Power systems operation; System marginal price; Temperature information; Temperature prediction; Forecasting,Article

Considering that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are suitable for processing time series data, in this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based forecasting model, BRIM, which splits the state neurons of a regular RNN into two parts: the forward states (using the historical electricity price information) are designed for processing the data in positive time direction and backward states (using the future price information available at inter-connected markets) for the data in negative time direction. Moreover, due to the fact that inter-connected power exchange markets show a common trend for other neighboring markets and can provide signaling information for each other, it is sensible to incorporate and exploit the impact of the neighboring markets on forecasting accuracy of electricity price. Specifically, future electricity prices of the interconnected market are utilized both as input features for forward LSTM and backward LSTM. By testing on day-ahead electricity prices in the European Power Exchange (EPEX), the experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method BRIM in enhancing predictive accuracy in comparison with the various benchmarks, and moreover Diebold-Mariano (DM) shows that the forecast accuracy of BRIM is not equal to other forecasting models, and thus indirectly demonstrates that BRIM statistically significantly outperforms other schemes. © 2019 by the authors.",Bidirectional recurrent neural network; Deep learning; Electricity price forecasting; Market integration,Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Deep learning; Forecasting; Information use; Long short-term memory; System stability; Bidirectional recurrent neural networks; Competitive environment; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Market integration; Power system stability; Power-exchange market; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Power markets,Article

However, comparative insights on consumer responses to both these prices have not received attention. This paper attempts to fill this void by developing a system-wide demand response model to better understand price elasticities under DAM and RTM pricing. These insights may also assist grid operators to develop improved short-term forecasts of electricity demand.

"Kaplun V., Osypenko V.",About Using Electricity Pricing for Smart Grid Dynamic Management with Renewable Sources,2019,2.0,"A new approach to the design subsets (clusters) of 'objects' for optimal pricing in local systems of Smart Grid (SG) of the combined type has been proposed. In our case, under term 'objects' we understand the day-time (more precisely, twenty-four hours) periods, in which the necessary measurements of informative, from the standpoint of the task, values (the energy generated by the components of the system, its current cost for each type of generator, etc.) were performed. We assume that systems Smart Grid are based on renewable generation sources such as solar radiation and wind energy in combination with such system components as high-power storage batteries and power generators based on autonomous power station. The obtained statistical information formed the basis of constructing models that describe certain optimal in terms of developed criteria of a subset of 'objects' using bi-clustering algorithms. The authors of this innovative approach have in mind the further application of the model output (optimal clustering) for the dynamic estimation of the total cost of energy generated by its own components, taking into account the cost of the network involved in the subsequent periods of the day. In research the half-hourly sampling time within one day was used. Simulation on the basis of collected statistical data, the results of which can be applied in processes (algorithms) of electricity pricing for smart grid dynamic management with renewable sources has been performed. © 2019 IEEE.",dynamic energy management; electricity pricing; renewable sources; Smart Grid,Clustering algorithms; Costs; Digital storage; Electric generators; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission networks; Power markets; Statistics; Wind power; Constructing models; Dynamic energy managements; Electricity pricing; Innovative approaches; Renewable generation; Renewable sources; Smart grid; Statistical information; Smart power grids,Conference Paper
"Baek M., Ashuri B.",Analysis of the Variability of Submitted Unit Price Bids for Asphalt Line Items in Highway Projects,2019,2.0,"Highway construction costs are subject to significant variations from project to project and over time. Variations in construction cost disrupt transportation agencies in making right investment decisions and estimating accurate construction costs for projects. A wide range of variables has been proposed in different studies to explain variations in construction cost. There is value in conducting a research study that attempts to consider a comprehensive list of variables with potentials to explain the variations. The study needs to simultaneously take into account all possible explanatory variables to examine their relations with construction costs. The objective of this research is to assess the relations of several potential variables to explain variations in submitted unit price bids for major asphalt line items in highway projects. The primary contribution of this paper to the body of knowledge is the creation of a random parameters model to explain variations in submitted unit price bids for asphalt line items in highway projects. The identified variables used to build the random parameters model were classified into two major tiers. Tier 1 represents project-specific categories, including project characteristics, major supply sources for critical materials, and price adjustment clauses. Tier 2 represents global and external categories, consisting of the level of activities in local highway construction market, construction market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, and energy market conditions. It is expected that the findings of this paper will contribute to the current practice of cost estimation and investment decision making by helping transportation agencies develop more accurate budgets and contractors prepare more accurate bids for highway projects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Asphalt; Budget control; Commerce; Decision making; Highway planning; Investments; Road construction; Construction markets; Explanatory variables; Highway construction; Highway construction costs; Investment decision making; Investment decisions; Project characteristics; Transportation agencies; Cost estimating,Article
"Jufri F.H., Oh S., Jung J.",Day-Ahead System Marginal Price Forecasting Using Artificial Neural Network and Similar-Days Information,2019,2.0,"Day-ahead system marginal price (SMP) forecasting constitutes essential information in the competitive energy market. Hence, this paper presents the development of a day-ahead SMP forecasting model via implementing an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The accuracy of the ANN-based model is improved by including long-term historical data in addition to short-term historical data and by applying the k-fold cross-validation optimization algorithm. The selection of the short-term type input variable applies the Pearson correlation coefficient. Whereas the long-term type input variable is selected by applying the discrete Fréchet distance in conjunction with the information related to the season and type of the day to find the Similar-Days Index. In order to verify the model, the forecasted load and actual SMP for 15 years of historical data are used. The results indicate that the proposed model can forecast SMP with higher accuracy than the conventional forecasting model. © 2019, The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.",Artificial neural network (ANN); Day-ahead SMP forecasting; Similar days; SMP forecasting; System marginal price (SMP),Correlation methods; Forecasting; Neural networks; Day-ahead; Forecasting modeling; Historical data; Input variables; K fold cross validations; Pearson correlation coefficients; Similar day; System marginal price; Power markets,Article
"Aineto D., Iranzo-Sánchez J., Lemus-Zúñiga L.G., Onaindia E., Urchueguía J.F.",On the influence of renewable energy sources in electricity price forecasting in the Iberian market,2019,2.0,"The mainstream of EU policies is heading towards the conversion of the nowadays electricity consumer into the future electricity prosumer (producer and consumer) in markets in which the production of electricity will be more local, renewable and economically efficient. One key component of a local short-term and medium-term planning tool to enable actors to efficiently interact in the electric pool markets is the ability to predict and decide on forecast prices. Given the progressively more important role of renewable production in local markets, we analyze the influence of renewable energy production on the electricity price in the Iberian market through historical records. The dependencies discovered in this analysis will serve to identify the forecasts to use as explanatory variables for an electricity price forecasting model based on recurrent neural networks.

"Kim J.-H., Kim H.-J., Yoo S.-H.",Willingness to pay price premium for smartphones produced using renewable energy,2019,2.0,"Due to air pollution and greenhouse gases issues associated with the use of fossil fuels and nuclear safety issues after the Fukushima accident, consumers are increasingly in favor of commodities produced using electricity generated from relatively expensive renewable energy (RE) rather than cheap fossil fuels or nuclear energy. This is usually called 'RE100'. The objective of this study is to examine South Korean consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) price premium for a RE100 commodity using the specific case of smartphones. We accomplished the purpose by conducting a contingent valuation survey of 1000 individuals in August 2018 and analyzing the data gathered from the survey. In addition, the spike model was applied to dealing with the zero WTP responses. Based on the analysis results, an average price premium was statistically significantly estimated to be KRW 11,699 (USD 10.5) for all respondents. This is worth 1.6% of the price for a conventional non-RE100 smartphone (KRW 750,000 or USD 673.9) and is higher than the cost increase (0.97%) when producing RE100 smartphones. Therefore, it can be seen that South Korean consumers have sufficient acceptance for RE100 smartphones. © 2019 by the authors.",Consumer preference; Contingent valuation; Price premium; Renewable energy; Smartphone,alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; consumption behavior; contingent valuation; electricity generation; energy market; greenhouse gas; mobile phone; nuclear accident; preference behavior; willingness to pay; South Korea,Article

"Li Y., Liang R., Li Z., Gao J., Wang Y., Wu T.",Research on electricity price forecasting method based on genetic algorithm and neural network in power market,2018,2.0,"With the development of electric power industry marketization, the importance of electricity price forecasting has been gradually highlighted. Because of the randomness of electricity price and the good generalization ability of neural network to deal with various non-linear problems, the Back Propagation (BP) neural network algorithm is widely used to predict electricity price. However, BP neural network has some disadvantages such as slow convergence rate and easy to fall into local optimum, so this paper improves the BP neural network prediction algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA). The traditional BP neural network is easy to get the error signal into local minima, and the genetic algorithm can solve the problem by optimizing the weights and thresholds of BP neural network. This paper chooses the electricity price of electricity market in Australia as an example, uses the genetic algorithm and BP neural network model to solve the actual operation, realizes the cause of the final error, and verifies the superiority of BP neural network based on genetic algorithm compared with the traditional BP neural network. © 2018 IEEE.",BP Networks; Electricity Market; Electricity Price Forecasting; Error Analysis; Genetic Algorithms,Backpropagation algorithms; Commerce; Electric industry; Error analysis; Errors; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks; Back propagation neural networks; BP networks; BP neural network model; BP neural networks; Electric power industries; Electricity price forecasting; Generalization ability; Nonlinear problems; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Arci F., Reilly J., Li P., Curran K., Belatreche A.",Forecasting short-term wholesale prices on the irish single electricity market,2018,2.0,"Electricity markets are different from other markets as electricity generation cannot be easily stored in substantial amounts and to avoid blackouts, the generation of electricity must be balanced with customer demand for it on a second-by-second basis. Customers tend to rely on electricity for day-to-day living and cannot replace it easily so when electricity prices increase, customer demand generally does not reduce significantly in the short-term. As electricity generation and customer demand must be matched perfectly second-by-second, and because generation cannot be stored to a considerable extent, cost bids from generators must be balanced with demand estimates in advance of real-time. This paper outlines a a forecasting algorithm built on artificial neural networks to predict short-term wholesale prices on the Irish Single Electricity Market so that market participants can make more informed trading decisions. Research studies have demonstrated that an adaptive or self-adaptive approach to forecasting would appear more suited to the task of predicting energy demands in territory such as Ireland.

"Huang S.-C., Wu C.-F.",Energy commodity price forecasting with deep multiple kernel learning,2018,2.0,"Oil is an important energy commodity. The difficulties of forecasting oil prices stem from the nonlinearity and non-stationarity of their dynamics. However, the oil prices are closely correlated with global financial markets and economic conditions, which provides us with sufficient information to predict them. Traditional models are linear and parametric, and are not very effective in predicting oil prices. To address these problems, this study developed a new strategy. Deep (or hierarchical) multiple kernel learning (DMKL) was used to predict the oil price time series. Traditional methods from statistics and machine learning usually involve shallow models; however, they are unable to fully represent complex, compositional, and hierarchical data features. This explains why traditional methods fail to track oil price dynamics. This study aimed to solve this problem by combining deep learning and multiple kernel machines using information from oil, gold, and currency markets. DMKL is good at exploiting multiple information sources. It can effectively identify the relevant information and simultaneously select an apposite data representation. The kernels of DMKL were embedded in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is a deep model and efficient at representing complex and compositional data features. This provided a solid foundation for extracting the key features of oil price dynamics. By using real data for empirical testing, our new system robustly outperformed traditional models and significantly reduced the forecasting errors. © 2018 by the authors.

The models under consideration belong to the class of factor models while our full model features a two-factor price process and a two-component stochastic volatility process. The first factor in the price process captures the normal variations; the second accounts for spikes. The two-component volatility allows for a flexible autocorrelation structure. Instead of using various filtering techniques for splitting the factors, as often found in the literature, we estimate the model in one step using the particle MCMC method. We fit the models to both the spot market and the forward market for UK natural gas. We find that the inclusion of stochastic volatility is crucial for the statistical fit of spot prices whereas the spikes are important for explaining forward prices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Energy prices; Forward prices; Multi-factor model; Spikes; Stochastic volatility,Commerce; Costs; Stochastic systems; Energy prices; Forward price; Multi factors; Spikes; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic models; autocorrelation; energy market; natural gas; numerical model; price determination; stochasticity; United Kingdom,Article

Automated negotiation plays a crucial role in the decision support for energy transactions due to the constant need for players to engage in bilateral negotiations. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate bilateral contract prices, which is essential to support market players in their decisions, enabling adequate risk management of the negotiation process. The proposed approach uses an adaptation of the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm to choose the best from a set of possible contract prices forecasts that are determined using several methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), among others. The learning process assesses the probability of success of each forecasting method, by comparing the expected negotiation price with the historic data contracts of competitor players. The negotiation scenario identified as the most probable scenario that the player will face during the negotiation process is the one that presents the higher expected utility value. This approach allows the supported player to be prepared for the negotiation scenario that is the most likely to represent a reliable approximation of the actual negotiation environment. © 2017 IEEE.",bilateral contracts; decision support; electricity market; learning algorithm; negotiation process,Commerce; Costs; Decision support systems; Neural networks; Power markets; Reinforcement learning; Risk management; Risk perception; Support vector machines; Automated negotiations; Bilateral contracts; Bilateral negotiations; Decision supports; Forecasting methods; Negotiation process; Probability of success; Restructuring process; Learning algorithms,Conference Paper
"Zhao Z., Wang C., Nokleby M., Miller C.J.",Improving short-term electricity price forecasting using day-ahead LMP with ARIMA models,2018,2.0,"Short-term electricity price forecasting has become important for demand side management and power generation scheduling. Especially as the electricity market is becomes more competitive, a more accurate price prediction than the day-ahead locational marginal price (DALMP) published by the independent system operator (ISO) will benefit participants in the market by increasing profit or improving load demand scheduling. Hence, the main idea of this paper is to use autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to obtain a better LMP prediction than the DALMP by utilizing the published DALMP, historical real-time LMP (RTLMP) and other useful information. First, a set of seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models utilizing the DALMP and historical RTLMP are developed and compared with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models that use the differences between DALMP and RTLMP on their forecasting capability. A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is implemented to further improve the forecasting by accounting for the price volatility. The models are trained and evaluated using real market data in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region. The evaluation results indicate that the ARMAX-GARCH model, where an exogenous time series indicates weekend days, improves the short-term electricity price prediction accuracy and outperforms the other proposed ARIMA models. © 2017 IEEE.",ARIMA models; Electricity market; Locational marginal price; Price prediction,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Scheduling; ARIMA models; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Autoregressive moving average model; Electricity price forecasting; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Independent system operators; Locational marginal prices; Price prediction; Power markets,Conference Paper

In this paper we try to incorporate this uncertainty in the electricity price forecasting model by applying interval numbers to express the price of electricity, with no intention of exploring influencing factors. This paper represents a hybrid model based on fuzzy C-mean clustering and the interval-valued autoregressive process for forecasting the short-term electricity price. A fuzzy C-mean algorithm was used to create interval time series to be forecasted by the interval autoregressive process. In this way, the efficiency of forecasting is improved because we predict the interval, not the crisp value where the price will be. This approach increases the flexibility of the forecasting model. © 2018 by the authors.

A novel clustering method is proposed that uses a modified game theoretic self-organizing map (GTSOM) and neural gas (NG) along with competitive Hebbian Learning (CHL) to provide a better vector quantization (VQ). To resolve the deficiency of the original SOM, five strategies are proposed to enable the non-winning neurons to participate in the learning phase. Using GTSOM, the price-load input data are clustered into proper number of subsets. A novel cluster-selection method is proposed to select the most appropriate subset whose time-series data is processed to provide the inputs for the neural networks. Finally, Bayesian method is used to train the networks and forecast the electricity price. Market price data from an independent system operator is used to evaluate the algorithm performance.

"Minhas D.M., Khalid R.R., Frey G.",Activation of electrical loads under electricity price uncertainty,2017,2.0,"The electricity price is an uncertain and changeable entity, mostly depends on power generating source and consumer's power demands behavior. The problem arises when all the consumers try to avail specific low price time slot to activate their power demands. It ends up with energy congestion or system destabilization. A better strategy is, to forecast a day ahead price and update it instantly, whenever a new consumer purchases an amount of energy for its next day demands. Therefore, every time a new price is applicable for the upcoming purchasers on day-ahead basis. This strategy may be adopted by an aggregator. An aggregator, which is equipped with renewable energy resources (RES), also imports electricity from the grid. It forecasts and updates a day-ahead fluctuating electricity price for its consumers. So that, all the consumers can avail relatively low price electricity slots based on their energy purchasing decisions. In this paper, a regression base statistical model is adopted to investigate two major problems: 1) accurate forecasting of day-ahead electricity price by an aggregator; 2) activate load demands by the consumers at lower electricity prices. In our proposed solution, linear regression is used to forecast the electricity price, exploiting intermittent nature of the renewables. Whereas, load activation strategy is proposed by introducing electrical loads with different levels of delay tolerance. Applying boundary condition values using logistic regression, a consumer can activate its loads on different electricity prices. The simulation results have established an effectively forecasted value of electricity price and an accurate activation of consumer's load demands. © 2017 IEEE.",demand response; load management; price forecasting; regression models,Chemical activation; Consumer behavior; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Electric load management; Electric power utilization; Energy resources; Forecasting; Purchasing; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Demand response; Electricity prices; Logistic regressions; Price forecasting; Purchasing decisions; Regression model; Renewable energy resource (RES); Statistical modeling; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Ding M., Wang X., Wang J., Yang Z., Zhong H., Yang J.",A dynamic period partition method for time-of-use pricing with high-penetration renewable energy,2017,2.0,"Time-of-use (TOU) pricing has become an effective measure to incentivize demand response (DR) resources to interact with power grids and facilitate the accommodation of renewable energy. In this paper, a TOU pricing method is proposed considering dynamic time period partition. Distinguished from the conventional TOU prices fixed for a long term, the proposed time period partition is updated every day due to the volatility of high-penetration renewable energy, and determined based on the day-ahead system net load forecast. For practical implementation with minimal policy adjustment, the levels of TOU prices remain unchanged, and the daily time periods are categorized into three clusters using the Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm, i.e., peak, intermediate and valley periods. Then a day-ahead economic dispatch model considering DR is formulated to evaluate the impacts of the proposed TOU prices on the accommodation of renewable energy. Case studies based on a provincial power grid illustrates that the proposed method can determine the time period partition of TOU prices according to the system net load forecast, and effectively encourage DR resources to interact with power grids and improve renewable energy accommodation. © 2017 IEEE.",clustering; demand response; renewable energy; time period partition; time-of-use pricing,Clustering algorithms; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Fuzzy clustering; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; clustering; Demand response; Renewable energies; Time period partitions; Time-of-use pricing; Electric load dispatching,Conference Paper
"Gupta S., Chitkara P.",Day ahead price forecasting models in thin electricity market,2017,2.0,"Day Ahead Electricity Markets (DAMs) in India are thin but growing. Consistent price forecasts are important for their utilization in portfolio optimization models. Univariate or multivariate models with standard exogenous variables such as special day effects etc. are not always useful. Drivers of demand and supply include weather variations over large geographic areas, outages of power system elements and sudden changes in contracts which lead the players to access power exchanges. These needs to be considered in forecasting models. Such models are observed to considerably reduce forecasting errors by outperforming other models under conditions, which are neither infrequent nor recur at defined intervals. This paper develops models for India and tests the utility of these models using Model Confidence Set (MCS) approach which picks up the 'best' models. The approach has been developed for a power utility in India over a period of two years in live business environment. © 2017 IEEE.",Day ahead price forecasting; Electricity market; IEX; MCS; thin electricity market,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Optimization; Business environments; Day-ahead electricity market; Day-ahead prices; Exogenous variables; Forecasting error; Forecasting models; Multivariate models; Portfolio optimization models; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Tobaru S., Muarapaz C.C., Conteh F., Senjyu T., Howlader A.M., Danish M.S.S.",Design of hybrid renewable energy systems considering optimal real-time pricing,2017,2.0,"In remote islands in Japan, there is a need to introduce renewable energy to meet the demand, because the power system in these areas are basically composed of internal combustion generators from which the generated energy is expensive and it is not friendly to the environment nowadays. However, the uncertainty of renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind generator (WG), makes it difficult to predict the output power of these resources. Hence, battery energy storage system (BESS) is being introduced. BESS is very effective equipment because it is possible to prevent the power output variation of renewable energy facilities through the charging and discharging of the BESS. Furthermore, demand response (DR) program is attracting attention as an effective instrument for energy management method. It can be divided into two main categories: time-based program and incentive-based program. This paper addresses real-time pricing (RTP) under the time-based program. It enables power supplier to control the load demand based on electricity prices. This paper presents the optimization method to determine the capacity of PV, WG, and BESS in 100% renewable energy small power systems and also indicates the effectiveness of optimal RTP. © 2016 IEEE.",,Costs; Electric energy storage; Real time systems; Battery energy storage systems; Demand response programs; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Incentive-based programs; Internal combustion; Renewable energy source; Small power systems; Wind generator systems; Renewable energy resources,Conference Paper

These forecasting tools are developed based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). A series of historical price data of the TEM are utilized to model and optimize the ANN structure and to develop the ANN-based price forecasting tool. The methodology used to select the optimum ANN architecture provides the minimum daily mean absolute percentage error for both day-ahead market prices in the TEM. Performances of the proposed ANN model and the multiple linear regression model in forecasting the day-ahead hourly market clearing price are compared.

"Vijayalakshmi S., Girish G.P., Singhania K., Vincent E.N.",Is Indian Spot Electricity Price Series Stationary?,2017,2.0,"Day-ahead spot electricity market of Indian energy exchange operates all 24 hours, 365 days a year. Many studies in literature have explored modeling spot electricity prices particularly in the context of NordPool, CalPx and PJM markets but very few studies in literature have explored modeling spot electricity prices in Indian context. Is Indian Spot Electricity Price Series Stationary? Answering this fundamental question paves way for application of techniques inspired from time series econometric modeling and forecasting literature which makes an inherent assumption that the underlying price-series is stationary. In this study we empirically investigate whether Spot Electricity Price Series is Stationary by using 17,520 hourly spot prices for each of the five regions of Indian electricity market and applying Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test, Phillips Peron Test, Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin Test and Narayan and Popp Test allowing for structural breaks.

"Abate G.D., Haldrup N.",Space-time modeling of electricity spot prices,2017,2.0,"Using data for the Nord Pool power grid, we derive a space-time Durbin model for electricity spot prices with both temporal and spatial lags. Joint modeling of temporal and spatial adjustment effects is necessarily important when prices and loads are determined in a network grid. By using different spatial weight matrices, statistical tests show significant spatial dependence in the spot price dynamics across areas. In fact, estimation of the model shows that the spatial dependence is as important as the temporal dependence in describing the spot price dynamics. We decompose price impacts into direct and indirect effects and demonstrate how price effects transmit to neighboring markets and decline with distance. A forecasting comparison with a non-spatial model shows that the space-time model improves forecasting performance for 7 and 30 days ahead forecasts. A model with time-varying parameters is estimated for an expanded sample period and it is found that the spatial correlation within the power grid has increased over time. We interpret this to indicate an increasing degree of market integration within the sample period. © 2017 by the IAEE.

"Asan G., Tasaltin K.",Market efficiency assessment under dual pricing rule for the Turkish wholesale electricity market,2017,2.0,"This study analyses the price dynamics of day-ahead and real-time electricity prices following the implementation of dual-pricing legislation in Turkey, to understand the legislation's impact on arbitrage opportunities and market efficiency. The convergence of prices between the day-ahead forward and the real-time markets analysed in order to determine whether persistent price differences between the two markets exist. Arbitrage opportunities exist if there is a persistent difference between prices in the day-ahead forward and real-time market. Markets are considered to be efficient if it is not possible for market participants to earn an excess profit through exploitation of price differences. Furthermore, we examined how the ex-post risk premium changes over time using rolling estimations and find that after the implementation of dual pricing, the risk premium increased significantly for day and peak hours where the demand is relatively higher compared to night hours. As market participants have more experience regarding the dynamics of the market, the difference between real-time and day-ahead forward prices converges to zero since the dual-pricing regime enforce market participants to forecast accurately by punishing the forecast error. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity; Market efficiency; Market structure,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Efficiency; Electricity; Risk perception; Arbitrage opportunity; Convergence of prices; Electricity prices; Market efficiency; Market participants; Market structures; Rolling estimations; Wholesale electricity markets; Power markets; efficiency measurement; electricity supply; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; policy implementation; pricing policy; real time; Turkey,Article
"Burnett J.W., Zhao X.",Spatially Explicit Prediction of Wholesale Electricity Prices,2017,2.0,"Transmission constraints often limit the flow of electricity in a regional transmission network leading to strong interaction effects across different geographically distributed points within the system. In modern wholesale electricity markets, these transmission constraints lead to spatial patterns within the nodal electricity spot prices. This study exploits these spatial patterns to better predict spot prices within a wholesale electricity market. More specifically, we use the latest spatial panel data econometric models to compare within-sample and out-of-sample forecasts against nonspatial panel data models. The spatial panel data approach is explained by demonstrating a simple network optimization model. We find that a dynamic, spatial panel data model provides the best predictions within a forecasting error context. Our results may suggest that the spatial autocorrelation between node prices extends beyond the current market-defined zonal boundaries, which calls into question whether the zonal boundaries accurately reflect the congestion boundaries within the system. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",electricity prices; forecasting; locational marginal pricing; spatial panel data econometrics,autocorrelation; econometrics; electricity supply; error analysis; forecasting method; optimization; panel data; price dynamics; spatial data,Article

"De Marcos R.A., Reneses J., Bello A.",Long-term Spanish electricity market price forecasting with cointegration and VEC models,2016,2.0,"Commodity and electricity price models are motivated by the several unexpected evolutions that commodity prices have shown over the previous decades. Several models are based on the classic Black-Scholes model, which was one of the first to simulate the stochastic behaviour of commodity prices. However, as of today, these forecasting models show poor performance when tested in long-term horizons, especially when applied to electricity market prices. This work attempts to determine a way to provide a decent accuracy in long-term (one year or more) forecasts of the Spanish electricity market price using cointegration and vector error correction (VEC) models, alongside other variables, such as fuel spot prices and futures prices.

"Li P., Arci F., Reilly J., Curran K., Belatreche A.",Using artificial neural networks to predict short-term wholesale prices on the Irish Single Electricity Market,2016,2.0,"Electricity markets are different from other markets as electricity generation cannot be easily stored in large amounts and in order to avoid blackouts, the generation of electricity must be balanced with customer demand for it on a second-by-second basis. Customers tend to rely on electricity for day-to-day living and cannot replace it easily so when electricity prices increase, customer demand generally does not reduce significantly in the short-term. As electricity generation and customer demand must be matched perfectly second-by-second, and because generation cannot be stored to a large extent, cost bids from generators must be balanced with demand estimates in advance of real-time. This paper outlines a a forecasting algorithm built on artificial neural networks in order to predict short-term (72 hours ahead) wholesale prices on the Irish Single Electricity Market so that market participants can make more informed trading decisions. Research studies have demonstrated that an adaptive or self-adaptive approach to forecasting would appear more suited to the task of predicting energy demands in territory such as Ireland. Implementing an in-house self-adaptive model should yield good results in the dynamic uncertain Irish energy market. We have identified the features that such a model demands and outline it here. © 2016 IEEE.",,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Sales; Electricity generation; Electricity prices; Forecasting algorithm; Market participants; Research studies; Self adaptive approach; Self-adaptive models; Whole sale prices; Electric power generation,Conference Paper

"Lahouar A., Ben Hadj Slama J.",Comparative study of learning machine predictors for half-hour and day-ahead electricity price forecast in deregulated markets,2016,2.0,"The electricity markets all over the world have received several changes since the arrival of smart meters, real time pricing and deregulation waves. In such conditions, electricity price is a key index that reflects competition between generators, percentage of renewable generation and load behavior. An accurate forecast of the future price allows both producers and customers to plan their strategies, increase their profits and avoid contingencies. For this purpose, this paper proposes two predictors that perform half-hour-ahead and dayahead price forecast, respectively. Both predictors are based on three learning machines, namely artificial neural network, support vector regression and random forest, in addition to persistence model which is used as reference. The built models are tested through real historical time series from New South Wales in Australia, which include half-hourly price and load. The profiles are analyzed with the aim of defining correlations and choosing adequate inputs. Then, the performance of each machine is assessed using the mean absolute percentage error, in order to determine the most suitable prediction machine according to the case. Furthermore, the best forecast situations are plotted to evaluate the ability of predicting sudden and sharp price peaks. © 2016 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Day-ahead market; Deregulation; Short term price forecasting,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Deregulation; Electric power measurement; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Comparative studies; Day ahead market; Day-ahead price forecasts; Deregulated markets; Mean absolute percentage error; Renewable generation; Short-term price forecasting; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets,Conference Paper

"Khoussi S., Bilil H., Aniba G.",Optimal time of use of renewable electricity pricing: Three-player games model,2016,2.0,"Currently, the electricity demand is exponentially increasing due to the population growth. Therefore, the demand side management (DSM) is becoming unavoidable especially with the increasing use of renewable energy sources. One of the most known tactics of DSM is the use pricing strategies to threaten users to schedule their loads by controlling their own appliances. In this paper, a new model of electricity market operators is proposed based on three actors: The utility grid (G) with renewable energy (RE) generation, the electricity consumer (U) and a storage company (S). This approach aims to develop the adequate hourly prices which optimize the utility function of each operator. Then, in order to deal with this objective, two related games are defined. The first one is based on the satisfaction function of U and the G and aims to give the hourly prices of consumers' electricity bills. While the second one is based on the satisfaction function of G and S in order to optimize the hourly prices of G's electricity bills. Finally, a case study based on a given RE production and consumers load forecasts has been considered. Simulation results show that the obtained hourly prices allows the consumer load curve to follow the RE curve generation while achieving the main objective of the proposed approach. © 2015 IEEE.",game theory three players; optimization; outsourced storage; Renewable Energy based generation,Costs; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Game theory; Optimization; Population statistics; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Electricity consumers; Electricity demands; Model of electricity market; Population growth; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Satisfaction functions; Use of renewable energies; Electric power transmission networks,Conference Paper

"Garciá-Martos C., Caro E., Jesús Sánchez M.",Electricity price forecasting accounting for renewable energies: Optimal combined forecasts,2015,2.0,"Electricity price forecasting is an interesting problem for all the agents involved in electricity market operation. For instance, every profit maximisation strategy is based on the computation of accurate one-day-ahead forecasts, which is why electricity price forecasting has been a growing field of research in recent years. In addition, the increasing concern about environmental issues has led to a high penetration of renewable energies, particularly wind. In some European countries such as Spain, Germany and Denmark, renewable energy is having a deep impact on the local power markets. In this paper, we propose an optimal model from the perspective of forecasting accuracy, and it consists of a combination of several univariate and multivariate time series methods that account for the amount of energy produced with clean energies, particularly wind and hydro, which are the most relevant renewable energy sources in the Iberian Market. This market is used to illustrate the proposed methodology, as it is one of those markets in which wind power production is more relevant in terms of its percentage of the total demand, but of course our method can be applied to any other liberalised power market. As far as our contribution is concerned, first, the methodology proposed by Garciá-Martos et al (2007 and 2012) is generalised twofold: we allow the incorporation of wind power production and hydro reservoirs, and we do not impose the restriction of using the same model for 24 h. A computational experiment and a Design of Experiments (DOE) are performed for this purpose. Then, for those hours in which there are two or more models without statistically significant differences in terms of their forecasting accuracy, a combination of forecasts is proposed by weighting the best models (according to the DOE) and minimising the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAPE is the most popular accuracy metric for comparing electricity price forecasting models. We construct the combination of forecasts by solving several nonlinear optimisation problems that allow computation of the optimal weights for building the combination of forecasts. The results are obtained by a large computational experiment that entails calculating out-of-sample forecasts for every hour in every day in the period from January 2007 to December 2009. In addition, to reinforce the value of our methodology, we compare our results with those that appear in recent published works in the field. This comparison shows the superiority of our methodology in terms of forecasting accuracy. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.

"He J., Zhao C., Cai L., Cheng P., Shi L.",Supply and demand in smart grid: A closed-loop pricing strategy,2015,2.0,"How to design a dynamic pricing strategy in smart grid is an important but challenging problem due to the uncertainty of customers' demand and their reaction to the price. Most of the existing pricing strategies depend on the prediction of customers' demand and their reaction to the price, thus are not robust enough due to the prediction which may cause a high cost to the supplier. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop pricing algorithm (CPA), which can largely decrease the cost and result in both costing savings for customers and higher profit for the supplier, and thus achieves a win-win solution. We provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the win-win solution for customers and the supplier. We also prove that CPA can obtain a stable price. Extensive simulations confirm with our analysis and show that the combined cost saving and profit gain of both customers and the supplier can be 76% by the proposed algorithm compared with the prediction-based pricing algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.",Algorithm design and analysis; Heuristic algorithms; Power system dynamics; Prediction algorithms; Pricing; Schedules; Smart grids,Cost benefit analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Heuristic algorithms; Profitability; Sales; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Algorithm design and analysis; Extensive simulations; Power system dynamics; Prediction algorithms; Pricing algorithm; Smart grid; Supply and demand; Win-win solutions; Costs,Conference Paper
Carpio L.G.T.,Cointegration to estimate long-term electricity prices in periods of rationing: The case of the Brazilian hydrothermal system,2015,2.0,"The objective of this paper is to present a methodology to estimate the price curve of electricity during periods of energy deficit. This study is based on long-term cointegration relationships between the gross domestic product and the consumption of electricity in Brazil. The methodology estimates the price for each percentage unit deficit, thereby giving a curve with levels of deficit that can vary from 1% to 100%, in contrast to the current curve of prices in deficit, which is restricted to four levels. Prices in deficit are important parameters exogenous to the chain of models for planning the operation of electric power in Brazil, so the application of this methodology should have a positive impact on the calculation of marginal costs of operation and expansion, as well as on the calculation of the spot price. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Short Term Load/Price Forecasting (STL/PF) is performed for an electricity market that offers Demand Response (DR) Programs. The change in the forecasting errors, of both electricity price and demand, over years of inactive and active DR is monitored. Commonly used prediction methods, namely; Least Squares-Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM), and Random Forests (RF), are used for forecasting, to ensure the generality of the results. The Australian National Electricity Market (ANEM), specifically Victoria region, is used as a subject case study. It was concluded that adding DR programs decreases the volatility of electricity price, with no validated effect on demand. © 2015 IEEE.",Demand Response; Electricity Market; Forecasting; Power Demand; Smart Grid,Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Power markets; Support vector machines; Demand response; Demand response programs; Electricity prices; Least squares support vector machines; National electricity markets; Power demands; Prediction methods; Smart grid; Smart power grids,Conference Paper

"Gharesifard B., Basar T., Domínguez-García A.D.",Designing pricing strategies for coordination of networked distributed energy resources,2014,2.0,"We study the problem of aggregator's mechanism design for controlling the amount of active, or reactive, power provided, or consumed, by a group of distributed energy resources (DERs). The aggregator interacts with the wholesale electricity market and through some market-clearing mechanism is incentivized to provide (or consume) a certain amount of active (or reactive) power over some period of time, for which it will be compensated. The objective is for the aggregator to design a pricing strategy for incentivizing DERs to modify their active (or reactive) power consumptions (or productions) so that they collectively provide the amount that the aggregator has agreed to provide. The aggregator and DERs' strategic decision-making process can be cast as a Stackelberg game, in which aggregator acts as the leader and the DERs are the followers. In previous work [Gharesifard et al., 2013b, a], we have introduced a framework in which each DER uses the pricing information provided by the aggregator and some estimate of the average energy that neighboring DERs can provide to compute a Nash equilibrium solution in a distributed manner. Here, we focus on the interplay between the aggregator's decision-making process and the DERs' decision-making process. In particular, we propose a simple feedback-based privacy-preserving pricing control strategy that allows the aggregator to coordinate the DERs so that they collectively provide the amount of active (or reactive) power agreed upon, provided that there is enough capacity available among the DERs. We provide a formal analysis of the stability of the resulting closed-loop system. We also discuss the shortcomings of the proposed pricing strategy, and propose some avenues of future work. We illustrate the proposed strategy via numerical simulations. © IFAC.",Distributed control; Distributed energy resources; Energy market; Game theory; Power systems,Automation; Closed loop systems; Commerce; Costs; Data privacy; Distributed parameter control systems; Energy resources; Game theory; Machine design; Power markets; Standby power systems; Decision making process; Distributed control; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy markets; Market clearing mechanisms; Privacy preserving; Strategic decision making; Wholesale electricity markets; Decision making,Conference Paper
"Sandoval-Moreno J., Besancon G., Martinez J.J.",Lagrange Multipliers based price driven coordination with constraints consideration for multisource power generation systems,2014,2.0,"In the context of distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC), which has been attracting more and more attention in the recent years, the present paper proposes a price-driven coordination approach that allows explicit and decentralized computation of a model predictive controller for large scale systems (in the spirit of [1]), but also handling constraints. Based indeed in the relaxation and separation of a performance cost function, the coordinator computes a price vector (Lagrange Multiplier) that coordinates the global system while respecting its constraints. This vector is transmitted to the subsystems that use this information for adjusting the control policies according to the global objectives, but without total dependence on the coordinator. In particular, if this information is lost, the system can still be operative because the subsystems control strategies are computed locally. In this frame, a distributed power system is considered as an example, in which it is shown that the proposed technique indeed maintains the system in a stable operation, with the same characteristics as the case of a centralized control solution, as well as robustness under loss of information from the coordinator. © 2014 EUCA.",Decentralized Control; Model Predictive Control for Linear Systems; Power Plants,Costs; Decentralized control; Distributed computer systems; Linear systems; Model predictive control; Power plants; Predictive control systems; Centralized control; Control strategies; Distributed Model predictive Control; Distributed power systems; Handling constraints; Model predictive controllers; Power generation systems; Price-driven coordination; Lagrange multipliers,Conference Paper

"Egger P.H., Kesina M., Nigai S.",Contagious Energy Prices,2013,2.0,"We develop an empirical model of the determinants of end-use energy prices in 28 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. For this, we construct a unique panel data-set and formulate a spatial panel econometric model with fixed country effects for the period of 1980-2009. A special feature of the proposed empirical model is that cross-country interdependence in energy prices surfaces through two channels, a metric of similarity towards energy policy and a metric of trade in energy goods. We estimate the parameters of that model and conduct several comparative static experiments. We find that higher income per capita and lower efficiency in energy distribution tend to raise energy prices whereas higher net imports of energy and more abundant energy resource endowments reduce them. We also find that bilateral trade in energy goods is an important channel of transmission of shocks in energy prices across countries. The estimation results suggest that countries that use the same types of resources to generate energy are likely to transmit energy price shocks to each other through competition effects. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,competition (economics); data set; econometrics; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; energy resource; import; numerical model; OECD; panel data; price dynamics,Article

"Azadeh A., Tabrizi B.H., Ebrahimipour V.",A comparative study for optimum short-term forecasting of electricity price with uncertainty,2012,2.0,"This paper presents an integrated algorithm consisting of artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy linear regression (FLR) and conventional linear regression (CLR) for optimum short-term electricity price forecasting. Eight ANN models and seven well-known FLR models as well as CLR model are considered simultaneously to provide a robust framework for electricity price forecasting. Thus, it can be easily applied to uncertain and complex environments due to its flexibility. The input data are divided into train and test parts to test the results for further times. Data sets are compared with ANN, fuzzy regression (FR) and conventional regression (CR) techniques in a comprehensive empirical process, with respect to mean absolute percent error measure. It is shown that ANN leads to the most efficient outputs, although, sometimes FR models could yield suitable results. Then, the procedure is repeated for normalised data, and recent results are obtained again, which puts a validation on what was concluded before. At last, the research has been practiced in Iran and proved to be efficient, as the circumstances dominating the society do not follow a steady trend.

"Papler D., Bojnec Š.",Determinants of costs and prices for electricity supply in Slovenia,2012,2.0,"This paper analyzes determinants of costs and real prices for retail electricity supply in Slovenia. We estimate cost and price functions in a retail electricity distribution enterprise in Slovenia by ordinary least square regressions on time series data. We confirm the hypotheses that real costs for electricity supply are positively and significantly associated with the costs for purchases of electric energy from electricity producers/wholesalers and with remuneration costs in electricity distribution enterprises. We did not confirm a negative association between the real costs for retail electricity supply and the proxy variable for electricity market liberalization. Market deregulation and price liberalization with increased competition have caused an initial decline in real consumer prices of electric energy. We found that the real consumer price of electric energy is positively associated with producer/wholesaler prices of electric energy, real wages in electricity distribution enterprises, and real tax expenses in the distribution enterprise, but negatively associated with the variable for electricity market liberalization. The results confirm the crucial role of the transmission of producer/wholesaler prices of electric energy and costs within the distribution enterprises, including labor costs, on the consumer prices of electric energy. © 2012 M.E.

"Zareipour H., Janjani A., Leung H., Motamedi A., Schellenberg A.",Electricity price thresholding and classification,2011,2.0,"With the advent of smart grids, electricity consumers are expected to be enabled to respond to electricity price fluctuations. Thus, forecasting short-term future electricity prices is a key component of optimal demand-side management in an enabled competitive environment. While several price forecasting approaches are available, achieving low forecasting errors is not always possible, especially for markets with high price volatility. On the other hand, for demand-side management applications the exact value of future prices is not primarily required, rather, whether prices hit certain thresholds is the basis of making planning decisions. In this paper, classification of future electricity market prices with respect to pre-specified price thresholds is investigated. Two alternative models based on support vector machines are proposed in a multi-class, multi-step-ahead price classification context.

Gutiérrez-Alcaraz G.,Dynamic pricing and area-time specific marginal capacity cost for distribution investment deferment,2011,2.0,"Electricity deregulation makes it more feasible to apply differential rates across customers. Dynamic prices can be used to reflect the changes in marginal energy costs of a power system. Some dynamic pricing pilot projects reveal that dynamic prices can actually reduce or shift electricity usage. However, system-load peaks and local-area load peaks could occur at different times. When both peaks are coincident, two objectives can be achieved simultaneously by applying dynamic pricing: total system demand and local demand reduction. However, when these peaks are non-coincident, local demand requires investment. We propose and extended dynamic pricing scheme by taking area- and time-specific marginal distribution capacity costs into account for addressing locational investment deferral. Elasticity model which uses actual test data from pilot projects is adopted to estimate load reduction due to dynamic pricing. © 2011 IEEE.",Demand response; demand side management; distributed generation; dynamic pricing; investment deferral,Capacity costs; Demand reduction; Demand response; Demand side managements; Dynamic price; dynamic pricing; Elasticity model; Electricity deregulation; Electricity usage; Energy cost; Extended dynamics; Load reduction; Marginal distribution; Pilot projects; Test data; Distributed power generation; Economics; Elasticity; Electric utilities; Investments; Costs,Conference Paper

"Pany P.K., Ghosal S.P.",Intelligent systems for dynamic price forecasting in a competitive electricity market,2010,2.0,"The electric power industry in many countries all around the world is evolving into an era of market economy with deregulation and free competition. The understanding of electric power supply as a public service is being replaced by the notion that a competitive market is a more appropriate mechanism to supply energy to consumers with high reliability and low cost [1]. A key element of the electricity sector restructuring is the establishment of a market-driven price for electricity. The pricing system of electricity plays an important role in a competitive market. In the power market, the electricity price depends on the evolution of balance between the demand for electricity and the available supply. At the same time, many other market factors also influence the electricity price, such as economic growth, weather, the power-plant mix, the prices of fuels and the strategic behavior of large players (usually on the generation side). An active, fully competitive and liquid spot market for wholesale electricity will translate the physical risk of inadequate capacity into a financial risk of high prices and place higher requirements on price forecasting. Producers and consumers rely on price-forecasting information to propose their corresponding bidding strategies. If a producer has an accurate forecast of the prices, it can develop a bidding strategy to maximize its profit. On the other hand, a consumer can make a plan to minimize his own electricity cost if an accurate price forecast is available. © 2010 IEEE.",Autoregressive moving average; Conventional wavelet neural network; Dilation and translation; Lolac linear wavelet neural network,Autoregressive moving average; Bidding strategy; Competitive electricity markets; Competitive markets; Conventional wavelet neural network; Dilation and translation; Dynamic price; Economic growths; Electric power industries; Electric power supply; Electricity costs; Electricity prices; Electricity sector restructuring; Financial risks; High price; High reliability; Key elements; Lolac linear wavelet neural network; Low costs; Market economies; Market factors; Physical risks; Power markets; Price forecasting; Price forecasts; Pricing systems; Public services; Spot market; Strategic Behavior; Wholesale electricity; Commerce; Competition; Deregulation; Economics; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Electricity; Industrial electronics; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Power quality; Profitability; Robotics; Weather forecasting; Costs,Conference Paper

"Daneshi H., Srivastava A.K., Daneshi A.",Application of fuzzy logic to priced-based unit commitment under price uncertainty,2010,2.0,This paper proposes a new formulation for the price based unit commitment (PBUC) of electric power generators under a deregulated electricity market. The methodology is developed from the viewpoint of a generating company (GENCO) wishing to maximize its own profit and to hedge its risk as a participant in the market. The problem is expressed as a mixed integer programming (MIP) optimization model in which the expected profit is maximized while the uncertainty of forecasted market price is modeled as a fuzzy variable. The volatility of market price is identified by certain fuzzy definitions pertaining to market volatility. The proposed model can be solved using a standard mixed integer-programming (MIP) solver.

Vassilopoulos P.,"Price signals in ""Energy-only"" wholesale electricity markets: An empirical analysis of the price signal in France",2010,2.0,"This paper analyzes the price signals of the French wholesale electricity market. We build a model of electricity prices that takes into account several key features of the French electricity market in order to assess the capacity of the price signal to guide investments. Wholesale prices should reflect the imbalances in the generation mix but the signal can be distorted if monopoly rents and/or ""missing money"" are present. We simulate over the 2003-2005 period theoretical perfectly competitive prices with the installed capacity and with the optimal mix to estimate the capacity imbalances and scarcity rents. We then compare the investment signal sent by observed electricity prices and the theoretical prices with the installed capacity. Although there are signs of market conte stability for the mid-merit load, through market integration with the other continental markets, observed prices are too high for the baseload and too low for the peakload, as a result distorting the signal.

"Lei M., Feng Z.",A novel grey model to short-term electricity price forecasting for NordPool power market,2009,2.0,"In order to improve the forecasting precision of traditional grey model for Short-term price in competitive electricity market, a novel grey model is presented in this paper based on period-decoupled price sequence. According to the interval time of market cleaning, the historical price data are divided into 24 sequences or 48 sequences. In the proposed grey model, two kinds of price sequences, called the main sequence (MS) and the reference sequence (RS), are defined. The correlation coefficient between price sequences of adjacent time intervals is analyzed, which is more than 0.9522 obtained from the Nordpool data in 2007. Therefore, it is determined that the MS is composed of prediction-period price data, and the RS is composed of hour-before-period price data. Furthermore, considering the limitation of the least square method (LSM) used in the traditional grey model for identification the developing coefficient a and the grey input b, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is adopted instead of LSM. Thus the PSOGM (1,2) forecasting model to short-term price is founded. The historical data from the Nordpool power market is used for computing, and the numerical results demonstrate that the MAPE of PSOGM (1,2) model for short-term price rolling prediction is 5.0626% and 7.5491% for continuous forecasting, raising 3%~20% compared with traditional grey model. ©2009 IEEE.",Electrcity price forecasting; Grey model; Particle swarm optimization; Power market,Competitive electricity markets; Correlation coefficient; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting models; Forecasting precision; Grey Model; Historical data; Interval time; Least square methods; Numerical results; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Power markets; Price forecasting; Time interval; Commerce; Costs; Cybernetics; Electric load forecasting; Least squares approximations; Rapid solidification; Particle swarm optimization (PSO),Conference Paper
"Askarpour M., Zeinadini V.",Security-constrained unit commitment reaction to load and price forecasting errors,2009,2.0,"In daily power markets, forecasting electricity prices and loads is the most essential task and basis for security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) and risk management. An approach to predict the market behavior is to use the historical prices, loads and other required information to forecast the future prices and loads. This paper forecasts the loads and prices with artificial neural networks (ANN) and does the unit commitment for the IEEE 30 bus test system using the ANN results. Price and load forecasting done with multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF). Forecasted load and price of MLP and RBF have been applied to IEEE 30 bus test system separately.

When the error is low (lower than 2 percent) unit commitment acts properly and if the error become high then there are two reactions, the first one is instability of the bus test system network and the second is extra cost for network.

"Maghool E., Naghavi A., Ghaderi S.F.",Estimating cost function in power markets under pay-as-bid pricing rules using observed bid data,2008,2.0,"Estimating cost function of firms is very important in competitive electricity market. Complete information on the factors which can be used for estimating cost function is not definite and also is not accessible. The importance of cost function estimation is appeared when the Independent System Operator (ISO) decide to measure the market power which can be exerted by a market participant. In this paper a new method is applied for estimating cost function using observed bid information, weighted average prices and quantities in pay as bid auction in which each firm submit its prices and quantities. Wolak's cost function estimation model which is in uniform pricing auction, is applied to Iran's Electricity Market (IEM), where each genset submit its prices in ten increments which can be changed hourly, and quantities for producing in each load period. In this market, firm's cost function is recovered by optimizing behavior for each firm. After defining the profit of the firm and using the first order conditions for expected profit maximization, the generalized method of moment (GMM) is used for estimating cost function. In estimation procedure, the firm's cost function is obtained by using the weighted average prices, for computing the total revenue of each firm and the maximum accepted price, instead of market clearing price. © 2008 IEEE.",Cost function estimation; Electricity markets; Pay-as-bib auction; Weighted average price,Commerce; Cost functions; Economics; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric utilities; Marketing; Maximum likelihood estimation; Method of moments; Competitive electricity markets; Complete informations; Cost function estimation; Electricity markets; Estimation procedures; Expected profits; First-order conditions; Generalized method of moments; Independent system operators; Market clearing prices; Market participants; Market power; Pay as bids; Pay-as-bib auction; Pay-as-bid auctions; Power markets; Pricing rules; Total revenues; Uniform pricing; Weighted average price; Costs,Conference Paper

"Lin Z., Gao L., Zhang D.",Predictions of system marginal price of electricity using recurrent neural network,2006,2.0,"The accuracy of system marginal price (SMP) is important for bidding of generation companies. Based on analyzing characteristic of SMP, electrical load, historical value of SMP corresponding time and tendency of current SMP are regarded as three main influencing factors in estimating the next numeric value of SMP. A recurrent neural network is also introduced to forecast the SMP, because it has an ability of mapping dynamic system and SMP is regarded as a result of dynamic power market run. Aiming at the difficulty of determining neural network's structure and weights, the GA optimization algorithm is used to get them by previously combining binary encoding and real encoding.

"Lu X., Sugianto L.F., Lee V.",Test of asymmetry effect of demand on spot price using MCMC methods,2006,2.0,"Analysing and forecasting spot price has become a task that cannot be overlooked since the deregulation of the electricity market in Australia. There are many factors that affect electricity spot prices. Demand, especially, as one of the fundamental drivers, plays an important role as prices are decided according to the balance of the supply and demand. Financial economists have studied the temporal relationship between price and the trading volume in most commodity markets. The relationship implies the validity of a number of hypotheses, including sequential information arrival hypothesis and the market inefficiency, in the sense that volume can be used to predict future price changes. Such research finding can be used to design trading strategy for market players. Previous studies were either mainly concentrated on price itself or the direct relationship between demand and price, if they incorporate demand into spot price forecasting. In this paper, we attempt to find out whether or not positive and negative changes in demand have the same effect on spot price. As electricity spot prices possess the characteristics of mean-reversion, stochastic volatility and occasional Jumps, we considered a mean-reverting asset pricing model that allows the conditional variance to incorporate log-stochastic volatility and a Poisson-directed jump process. Due to the complexity of the model, conventional estimation methods, such as Ordinary Least Squares, Maximum Likelihood and Quasi Maximum Likelihood, do not suit anymore. To accommodate this, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, combined with Bayesian inference, is chosen to estimate the chosen model. MCMC methods have been reported to outperform the conventional estimation methods especially in estimating asset pricing models with stochastic volatility. The data we used in this study is the peak 30-minute spot price and demand from 2001-2005 in the Victoria region, Australia. The findings should help predict future electricity spot prices and strengthen any trading strategy based on price-demand relationship. © 2006 IEEE.",Asymmetry effect; Bayesian inference; MCMC methods; Price-demand relationship; Stochastic processes; Trading strategy,Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Poisson distribution; Random processes; Asymmetry effects; Bayesian inference; Price-demand relationship; Trading strategies; Costs,Conference Paper
"Ristanovic P., Waight J.",Locational marginal prices in practice: A vendor's perspective,2006,2.0,"Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) has been widely accepted as a suitable method for managing network congestion in energy markets. This presentation reviews the main ideas behind LMPs, and reviews the techniques used to implement LMP calculations in two energy markets in the US. The first case illustrates the case of ex-ante LMPs in the Day Ahead timeframe and in the Real-Time timeframe. In this case the calculations are based on the results of the day ahead market clearing and the real time market clearing. The second case illustrates the case of ex-post LMPs, in which the calculations are based on the results of the solved State Estimator. The practical problems encountered and solved as part of the implementation of these two systems, are reviewed. Key concerns are the quality of the network model, redundancy of data, and modeling of the market rules which identifying special cases and which identify the marginal units which are allowed to set the LMPs.

"Warland G., Fosso O.B., Wangensteen I., Wolfgang O.",Efficient transmission pricing in power systems with considerable time-dependency,2005,2.0,"In decentralized electricity markets agents typically have to pay a tariff for each unit feed into or taken out from the electrical grid. The tariff provides short- and long term signals to market participants (generators and consumers). Since the value of water normally will be prized close to the market price, and differences in water values between different reservoirs usually are small, these tariffs can have large influence on scheduling decisions in hydro dominated power systems. The paper address the problem of forecasting tariffs in fundamental optimization models for the electricity market in power system with a considerable share of hydropower. We discuss advantages/disadvantages with alternative optimization techniques for such models.

"Ruiz Monroy J.J., Kita H., Tanaka E., Hasegawa J.",Price forecasting in the day-ahead electricity market,2004,2.0,"Electricity markets are becoming more sophisticated and price forecasting is gaining importance for market participants to adjust their bids in the day ahead electricity market. Compared with load, the price of electricity is volatile, but it is not regarded as random; therefore it is possible to identify patterns based on historical data and load forecast. Market participants only have access to the public information provided by the Independent System Operator (ISO); this limits the ability of the market participants to produce accurate price forecast. An accurate estimation of the electricity price helps the market participants to determine their bidding strategy; making necessary the development of accurate price forecasting methods. In this paper the authors propose a statistical method for price forecasting considering the historical price and loads of the California power market; matching the load and price profiles of the forecasting day with historical data of previous similar days. Simulation results show that the forecasted price is closely related with the price historical data and the load of the forecasting day. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by comparing the actual price with the forecasted price and calculating the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The simulation results show the accuracy of the method and its practical application.

"Deng S.-J., Jiang W.",An inverse-quantile function approach for modeling electricity price,2002,2.0,"We propose a class of alternative stochastic volatility models for electricity prices using the quantile function modeling approach. Specifically, we fit marginal distributions of power prices to two special classes of distributions by matching the quantile of an empirical distribution to that of a theoretical distribution. The distributions from the first class have closed form formulas for probability densities, probability distribution functions, and quantile functions, while the distributions from the second class may have extremely unbalanced tails. Having rich tail behaviors, both classes allow realistic modeling of the power price dynamics. The appealing features of this approach are that it can effectively model the heavy tail behavior of electricity prices caused by jumps and stochastic volatility and that the resulting distributions are easy to simulate. This latter feature enables us to perform both parameter estimation and derivative pricing tasks based on price data directly observed from real markets. © 2002 IEEE.",Electricity supply industry; Energy management; ISO; Mathematical model; Power markets; Power system management; Pricing; Probability distribution; Risk management; Stochastic processes,Commerce; Costs; Distribution functions; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric utilities; Energy management; Inverse problems; Mathematical models; Power markets; Probability; Random processes; Risk management; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Empirical distributions; ISO; Marginal distribution; Power system management; Probability densities; Quantile functions; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic Volatility Model; Probability distributions,Conference Paper
"Muchayi M., El-Hawary M.E.",Method for optimal pricing of electric supply including transmission system considerations,1999,2.0,"Determining real-time electricity rate structures is currently receiving a great deal of attention. In this paper, a strategy for pricing electricity supply is formulated and evaluated. Unlike other methods which use only the variation of fuel cost for generation to estimate the rate structures, the proposed pricing algorithm incorporates the optimal allocation of transmission system operating costs based on time-of-use pricing. The transmission costs are obtained by assigning a price k to each unit of power flow in the network. The assignment does not discriminate between participants located at differing parts of the network. The real-time pricing reflects the instantaneous cost of production and functions as a load management tool because this interacts with consumer behavior. The demand for power flows and transmission on an electricity supply system, like the demand for any bundle of economic goods depends upon the assigned transmission prices, together with the economic benefit to the consumer. It is assumed that there are no privately owned generating plants and that all plants and transmission lines are operated by the utility. The modeling scheme is applied to the IEEE standard 5, 14, 30 and 57 bus power systems and involves solving a modified optimal power flow problem (OPF) iteratively using the MINOS package. It is concluded that the method has a wide potential application in electricity supply pricing.",,Algorithms; Costs; Electric load flow; Electric load management; Electric power transmission; Electric power utilization; Electric rates; Fuels; Electric supply; Fuel costs; Modified optimal power flow problem; Optimal pricing; Transmission system operating costs; Transmission systems considerations; Electric power systems,Article

The existence of a single price for power, result of the interaction of supply and demand, ensures that during each period, the forecasted generation output balances with the expected load. Transmission prices, considered as coordinate variables within a two level optimization scheme, can perform this task and ensure that the system remains together in the short-run and operates at minimum cost.

The issue of long-term planning in the electric utility industry as it relates to the adoption of socially optimal spot pricing is considered. Optimal investment conditions are derived and an algorithm is developed which allows integration of these conditions into long-term planning. The proposed algorithm is an extension of Booth-Baleriaux probabilistic production costing and thus exhibits high computational efficiency. It provides the building block for incorporating spot pricing into mathematical programming methodologies used in generation expansion planning. The algorithm's usefulness to produce optimal spot price forecasts that may induce socially efficient investments in non-utility-owned generation and to facilitate empirical studies on the income distributional impact of spot price implementation is discussed.,,ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS - Planning; COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY; ELECTRICITY SPOT PRICING; INVESTMENT DECISIONS; LONG-TERM PLANNING; OPTIMAL SPOT PRICING; PRODUCTION COSTING; ELECTRIC UTILITIES,Conference Paper
"Halužan M., Verbič M., Zorić J.",Performance of alternative electricity price forecasting methods: Findings from the Greek and Hungarian power exchanges,2020,1.0,"This paper evaluates the performance of alternative algorithms for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. Forecasting performance is assessed based on evidence from the Greek and Hungarian Power Market simulation. The electricity price formation process is simulated on a long time series spanning from January 2015 to September 2018. The EPF models are structured upon the explanatory variables that are available to the market participants before the exchange gate closure, through the publicly available ENTSO-E transparency platform. Relationships between the electricity spot price and explanatory variables are estimated by the selected econometric, data mining, and machine learning algorithms. The econometric autoregressive model with exogeneous explanatory variables is a benchmark model, as the other alternative approaches are used to overcome the linearity bias in the ordinary least squares estimator. We analyse the impact of a different training sample size as well as the impact of training on an hourly clustered sample on the forecasting performance. The support vector machine algorithm turned out to be the best alternative approach, with the lowest mean absolute error and statistically confirmed better forecasts compared to the benchmark econometric autoregressive model. The majority of the tested algorithms perform better with smaller training samples, whereas neural network based approaches prefer large training samples. Models with hourly clustered training samples have higher accuracy based on the Hungarian evidence, while hourly non-clustered training is a superior training method based on the Greek findings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial neural networks; Data mining; Electricity price forecasting; ENTSOE-E transparency platform; Greek power exchange; Hungarian power exchange; Learning sample size; Machine learning; Rolling-window,Data mining; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Power quality; Sampling; Support vector machines; Alternative algorithms; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Forecasting performance; Network-based approach; Ordinary least squares estimators; Power market simulation; Support vector machine algorithm; Power markets; accuracy assessment; algorithm; alternative energy; artificial neural network; econometrics; error analysis; machine learning; numerical model; performance assessment; support vector machine; time series; vector autoregression; Alfold; Hungary,Article

However, energy flexibility is required to cope with the increased share of renewable energy. Utilising it necessitates mathematical models of the operational response of energy flexible consumers. In this paper we present an accurate and general dynamic model of energy flexibility based on stochastic differential equations. The intuitive interpretation of the parameters is explained, to show the generality of the proposed model. To validate the approach, the parameters are estimated for three water towers and three buildings controlled by economic model predictive controllers. The model is then used to offer the energy flexibility on the current electricity market of Scandinavia, Nord Pool, using the so called “flexi orders”. Finally, the energy flexibility is used by controlling the demand of the water towers indirectly, through price signals designed based on the proposed model. Compared to having perfect foresight of electricity prices and future demand, between 63% and 98% of the potential savings were obtained in for these case studies. This shows that even without direct control of energy flexible systems, most of the potential can be reached under the current market conditions. © 2020 The Authors",Demand response; Energy flexibility; Flexibility function; State space model; Stochastic differential equations,Commerce; Differential equations; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Water towers; Electricity prices; Energy flexibility; Non-linear modelling; Perfect foresights; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Response of energy; Stochastic differential equations; Stochastic models; accuracy assessment; alternative energy; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity industry; nonlinearity; parameterization; price dynamics; stochasticity; Scandinavia,Article
Marcjasz G.,Forecasting electricity prices using deep neural networks: A robust hyper-parameter selection scheme,2020,1.0,"Deep neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity. However, their application requires setting multiple hyper-parameters, and the performance relies strongly on this choice. We address this issue and propose a robust ex-ante hyper-parameter selection procedure for the day-ahead electricity price forecasting that, when used jointly with a tested forecast averaging scheme, yields high performance throughout three-year long out-of-sample test periods in two distinct markets. Being based on a grid search with models evaluated on long samples, the methodology mitigates the noise induced by local optimization. Forecast averaging across calibration window lengths and hyper-parameter sets allows the proposed methodology to outperform a parameter-rich least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-estimated model and a deep neural network (DNN) with non-optimized hyper-parameters in terms of the mean absolute forecast error. © 2020 by the author.

"Zheng K., Wang Y., Liu K., Chen Q.",Locational Marginal Price Forecasting: A Componential and Ensemble Approach,2020,1.0,"Short-term locational marginal price (LMP) forecasting is the traditional problem of market participants and other institutions maximizing their profit. Most electricity market organizers in the world release the data of LMP along with its three components, i.e., the energy, congestion, and loss components. The series of the three components have their own patterns and driving factors, and can be utilized to improve the accuracy of LMP forecasting. However, most existing studies have focused on direct LMP forecasting and have barely noticed this characteristic. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between the released data of the three components and LMP forecasting through a componential and ensemble approach. Three individual forecasting models are selected and trained for these components, and an ensemble framework that stacks the summation LMP results and the direct results is proposed to enhance the overall accuracy and robustness.

Improving the forecast accuracy of photovoltaic generation is becoming essential to allow a massive solar penetration. In particular, improving the forecast accuracy of large solar farms’ generation is important both for the producers/traders to minimize the imbalance costs and for the transmission system operators to ensure stability. In this article, we provide a benchmark for the day-ahead forecast accuracy of utility scale photovoltaic (PV) plants in 1325 locations spanning the country of Italy. We then use these benchmarked forecasts and real energy prices to compute the economic value of the forecast accuracy and accuracy improvement in the context of the Italian energy market’s regulatory framework. Through this study, we further point out several important criticisms of the Italian “single pricing” system that brings paradoxical and counterproductive effects regarding the need to reduce the imbalance volumes.

"Liu D., Li C., Zhao D., Wang Q.",Research on the joint fluctuation laws between locational marginal price and renewables based on complex networks: A case study in Independent System Operator New England,2019,1.0,"The growing share of renewable energy has an increasingly significant impact on the electricity market. Locational marginal price (LMP), as a sensitive price signal, has a potential but considerable correlation with renewable energy generation. In this context, this paper focuses on the joint fluctuation laws between LMP and renewables consumed to generate electricity. At first, LMP and renewables consumption data from Independent System Operator New England (ISO-NE) are collected and preprocessed. Then, through highly comparative time-series analysis (hctsa), it is found that discrete symbolization features have effective description ability. Therefore, a coarse-grained method is conducted to convert the real matrix data into a symbol vector based on numerical distribution analysis. Next, joint fluctuation complex networks are constructed according to the symbol vector. From a global perspective, the joint fluctuation network follows an exponential distribution and exhibits hierarchical modularity. From a local perspective, the joint fluctuation network follows a power-law distribution. The research results of this paper provide a new perspective to understand the evolution of the electricity market with large-scale renewable energy and have reference value for identifying the valuable joint fluctuation patterns and improving the LMP forecast results. © 2019 The Authors.

"Radovanovic A., Nesti T., Chen B.",A Holistic Approach to Forecasting Wholesale Energy Market Prices,2019,1.0,"Electricity market price predictions enable energy market participants to shape their consumption or supply while meeting their economic and environmental objectives. By utilizing the basic properties of the supply-demand matching process performed by grid operators, known as optimal power flow (OPF), we develop a methodology to recover energy market's structure and predict the resulting nodal prices by using only publicly available data, specifically grid-wide generation type mix, system load, and historical prices. Our methodology uses the latest advancements in statistical learning to cope with high-dimensional and sparse real power grid topologies, as well as scarce, public market data, while exploiting structural characteristics of the underlying OPF mechanism. Rigorous validations using the Southwest power pool market data reveal strong correlation between the grid level mix and corresponding market prices, resulting in accurate day-ahead predictions of real-time prices. The proposed approach demonstrates a remarkable proximity to the state-of-the-art industry benchmark, while assuming a fully decentralized, market-participant perspective. Finally, we recognize limitations of the proposed and other evaluated methodologies in predicting large price spike values. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",big data; compressed sensing; electricity price forecast; Locational Marginal Price (LMP); statistical learning; wholesale energy markets,Big data; Compressed sensing; Costs; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Electricity prices; Environmental objectives; Industry benchmarks; Locational marginal prices; Rigorous validation; Statistical learning; Structural characteristics; Wholesale energy market; Power markets,Article
"Faza A., Al-Mousa A.",PSO-based optimization toward intelligent dynamic pricing schemes parameterization,2019,1.0,"Advances in the technologies of smart grids has made it possible to monitor and control the demand side of the power grid in ways that were not possible in the past. Thanks to the advances in information and communication technologies (ICT), Demand Side Management (DSM) is now possible, and promises more efficient and reliable power grids. This paper presents a study of different dynamic pricing techniques that are used as means to shape the demand in ways that minimize generation cost or maximize profit. This is achieved by using a fuzzy logic model that takes into account the different types of customers in the system. The paper further uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to generate the parameters that can achieve optimal grid operation. Results show that when customers are actively engaged in DSM schemes, and with the proper Dynamic Pricing scheme, optimal results can be obtained that benefit both the customers and the utility company, not to mention the savings in energy production and its impact on the sustainability of our cities. The results show that savings up to 12% in generation cost and a three times increase in profit can be achieved using an optimized DSM scheme. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Demand prediction; Demand side management; Fuzzy logic; Particle swarm optimization; Probabilistic model; Real-time pricing,Computer circuits; Demand side management; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Fuzzy logic; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Sales; Smart power grids; Demand prediction; Energy productions; Information and Communication Technologies; Monitor and control; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Probabilistic modeling; Real time pricing; Utility companies; Costs,Article
Sharimakin A.,Measuring the energy input substitution and output effects of energy price changes and the implications for the environment,2019,1.0,"Previous studies of decomposition of factor inputs have limited their analysis on the estimation of substitution and output effects. However, this paper develops a two-step approach to estimate the substitution and output effects of changes in energy demand resulting from changes in prices and further examines the implications of these effects on CO2 emissions using European industrial dataset over the period 1995–2007. In our empirical estimations, instead of relying only on iSUR model like previous studies, we introduced a multilevel model, which is a more befitting model to our data. Our analysis covers industry as a whole and for different sector types. The primary results emerged from our analysis suggest a strong evidence using the multilevel model. Generally, our results show that production inputs are substitutable. We find the substitution and output effects to be negatively related to CO2 emissions, however, the substitution effects dominate. From policy perspectives, our results suggest that output adjustments may not play a significant role in reducing emissions. We find the overall effects of changes in energy demand to be moderate. Then, we argue that increment in energy taxes should be complemented by cleaner factor substitution and sustainable growth to achieve a desirable carbon reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon emissions; Decomposition effects; European industries; Substitution elasticities,Carbon dioxide; Energy management; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Taxation; Carbon emissions; Empirical estimations; European industry; Factor substitutions; Reducing emissions; Substitution effect; Sustainable growth; Two-step approach; Industrial emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; demand elasticity; energy market; energy policy; price dynamics; substitution; Europe,Article
Fabre A.,Evolution of EROIs of electricity until 2050: Estimation and implications on prices,2019,1.0,"The EROI – for Energy Returned On Invested – of an energy technology measures its ability to provide energy efficiently. Previous studies draw a link between the affluence of a society and the EROI of its energy system, and show that EROIs of renewables are lower than those of fossil fuels. Logically, concerns have been expressed that system-wide EROI may decrease during a renewable energy transition. First, I explain theoretically that the EROIs of renewables themselves could then decrease as energy-efficient fossil fuels would be replaced by less energy-efficient renewables in the supply-chain. Then, using the multi-regional input-output model THEMIS, I estimate the evolution of EROIs and prices of electric technologies from 2010 to 2050 for different scenarios. Global EROI of electricity is predicted to go from 12 in 2010 to 11 in 2050 in a business-as-usual scenario, but down to 6 in a 100% renewable one. Finally, I study the economic implication of a declining EROI. An inverse relation between EROI and price is suggested empirically, even though theory shows that both quantities may move in the same direction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Energy transition; EROI; Input-output; MRIO; Sustainability; THEMIS,alternative energy; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy market; estimation method; fossil fuel; input-output analysis; price dynamics; scenario analysis; supply chain management; sustainability,Article
"Dumas J., Boukas I., De Villena M.M., Mathieu S., Cornelusse B.",Probabilistic Forecasting of Imbalance Prices in the Belgian Context,2019,1.0,"Forecasting imbalance prices is essential for strategic participation in the short-Term energy markets. A novel two-step probabilistic approach is proposed, with a particular focus on the Belgian case. The first step consists in computing the net regulation volume state transition probabilities. It is modeled as a matrix computed using historical data. This matrix is then used to infer the imbalance prices, since the net regulation volume can be related to the level of reserves activated and the corresponding marginal prices for each activation level are published by the Belgian Transmission System Operator one day before electricity delivery. This approach is compared to a deterministic model, a multi-layer perceptron, and to a widely used probabilistic technique, Gaussian Processes. © 2019 IEEE.",Electricity markets; imbalance prices forecasting; machine learning; probabilistic forecast,Commerce; Forecasting; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Power markets; Prices forecasting; Probabilistic approaches; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic forecasts; Probabilistic technique; Short term energy markets; State transition probabilities; Transmission system operators; Costs,Conference Paper
"Jahns C., Weber C.",Probabilistic Forecasting of Reserve Power Prices in Germany using Quantile Regression,2019,1.0,"Optimization models for the bidding in the German reserve power markets need an assumption for the probability density of the market prices. Even though probabilistic forecasting is becoming increasingly popular in the field of energy forecasting, this application does not seem to be covered in the literature. This paper focuses on probabilistic forecasts developed specifically for this application. A quantile regression model with natural cubic splines is proposed and backtested with historical prices from the German secondary reserve market. In addition, problems such as quantile crossing as well as advantages and disadvantages, compared to other probabilistic forecasting models, are discussed. The assessment by the continuous ranked probability score shows that the quantile regression method outperforms the benchmark ARMA model.

"Qin Q., Xie K., He H., Li L., Chu X., Wei Y.-M., Wu T.",An effective and robust decomposition-ensemble energy price forecasting paradigm with local linear prediction,2019,1.0,"Energy price time series exhibit nonlinear and nonstationary features, which make accurate forecasting energy prices challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition-ensemble forecasting paradigm based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and local linear prediction (LLP). The EEMD is used to decompose energy price time series into components, including several intrinsic mode functions and one residual with a simplified structure. Motivated by the findings of the fully local characteristics of a time series decomposed by the EEMD, we adopt the LLP technique to forecast each component. The forecasting results of all the components are aggregated as a final forecast. For validation, three types of energy price time series, crude oil, electricity and natural gas prices, are studied. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves an improvement in terms of both level forecasting and direction forecasting. The performance of the proposed model is also validated through comparison with several energy price forecasting approaches from the literature. In addition, the robustness and the effects of the parameter settings of LLP are investigated. We conclude the proposed model is easy to implement and efficient for energy price forecasting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Energy price; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Forecasting; Local linear prediction,Costs; Natural gas; Signal processing; Time series; Energy prices; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decompositions (EEMD); Ensemble forecasting; Intrinsic Mode functions; Local characteristics; Local linear predictions; Natural gas price; Forecasting; decomposition analysis; empirical analysis; energy market; ensemble forecasting; prediction; price determination; time series analysis,Article
"Lisin E., Kurdiukova G., Okley P., Chernova V.",Efficient methods of market pricing in power industry within the context of system integration of renewable energy sources,2019,1.0,"Currently, the majority of world economies (even those located in the sunbelt (+/− 35 degrees of latitude with good sunshine with low seasonality) uses various types of fossil fuels as the main source of energy for their economies. However, this represents a very volatile and unsustainable strategy, since according to various estimates, the fossil fuel era will inevitably end as all carbon fuels are going to be spent in the next few centuries. Unlike traditional energy, renewable energy sources (RES) are not based on energy resources, but rather rely upon natural energy flows. With regard to its unique property, there has been an active construction of power plants of renewable energy and their gradual integration into national energy supply systems in recent decades. At the same time, the existing models of electricity markets were unprepared for their wide distribution. Hence, determination of the market value of energy generated by power plants using renewable energy sources becomes a particularly significant issue. This market value has to take into account the prevention of costs from the use of fossil fuels, as well as the resulting environmental benefits. Our paper proposes methods for solving this problem, contributing to the increase of economic efficiency of investment projects for the construction of renewable energy facilities and the formation of economic incentives for their propagation in energy supply systems. The proposed methods are based on the dynamic differentiation of tariffs for consumers with renewable energy sources depending on their structure of electricity consumption. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by calculating the cost of electricity for households located in the Krasnodar region using renewable energy sources. It is shown that this approach to the formation of tariffs for consumers allows the household to receive additional savings from the efficient use of energy installations on RES and energy storage devices in terms of alignment of the energy consumption schedule. This creates a significant incentive for households to use them and contributes to increasing the effectiveness of government renewable energy support programs, including by solving the acute problem of raising electricity tariffs from the grid. © 2019 by the authors.

"Xu J., Baldick R.",Day-ahead price forecasting in ERCOT market using neural network approaches,2019,1.0,"Electricity is the ""blood"" of society. Electricity is a special commodity that is not storable, so its production and load should always be balanced to maintain a tightly regulated system frequency. Electricity production and load both depend on many factors, such as the weather, temperature, and wind. These characteristics make the dynamics of electricity price very different from that of any other commodities or financial assets. The electricity price can exhibit hourly, daily, and seasonal fluctuations, as well as abrupt unanticipated spikes. Now almost all electricity market participants use wind/load/price forecasting tools in their daily operations to optimize their operation plans, and bidding and hedging strategies, in order to maximize the profits and avoid price risks. However, the unreliable and inaccurate predictions with current forecasting tools have caused many serious problems, which can cause system instabilities and result in extreme prices even in the absence of scarcity. This paper presents an implementation of state of the art machine learning approaches into the forecasting tools for the ERCOT Day-Ahead market to improve the reliability and accuracy of electricity price prediction. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Electricity Price Forecasting; Machine Learning; Neural Networks,Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Smart power grids; System stability; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity production; Forecasting tools; Hedging strategies; Machine learning approaches; Market participants; Seasonal fluctuations; Power markets,Conference Paper

There are particularities in the case of the Mexican market, the main one being the gradual increase in the number of competitors observed until now and, on the other hand, the geographic and technical characteristics of the electric power generation. The observed prices to date show great fluctuations in the observed data due to diverse aspects; among the stems we can mention the own seasonality of the demand of electrical energy, the availability of fuel, the problems of congestion in the electrical network, as well as other risks such as natural hazards. For the above, it is relevant in a market context to have a price estimation as accurate as possible for the decision-making of supply and demand. This paper proposes a methodology for the generation of electricity price estimation through the application of stable alpha regressions, since the behavior of the electric market has shown the presence of heavy tails in its price distribution. © 2019 by the authors.",Alpha-stable distribution; Alpha-stable regression; Electricity markets; Electricity prices,decision making; demand analysis; electrical power; electricity; electricity supply; energy market; power generation; price dynamics; regression analysis; seasonality; spatial distribution; Mexico [North America],Article

Electricity prices in the power market exhibits highly non-linear and non-stationary that makes forecasting the electricity prices very difficult. Three major stages are involved in the proposed algorithms to forecast the electricity prices. In stage I, discrete wavelet transform (db4, level 3) is applied for decomposing the prices of electricity data to a set of constitutive for reducing the variation in the prices data. In stage II, ANFIS is used to forecast the electricity prices. KHA has been adopted in updating the various weights in the ANFIS to get better accuracy. The code of the hybrid algorithm has been developed in MATLAB. The proposed Wavelet-KHA-ANFIS has been tested on the real time system.

"De Marcos R.A., Bello A., Reneses J.",Short-term electricity price forecasting with a composite fundamental-econometric hybrid methodology,2019,1.0,"Various power exchanges are nowadays being affected by a plethora of factors that, as a whole, cause considerable instabilities in the system. As a result, traders and practitioners must constantly adapt their strategies and look for support for their decision-making when operating in the market. In many cases, this calls for suitable electricity price forecasting models that can account for relevant aspects for electricity price forecasting. Consequently, fundamental-econometric hybrid approaches have been developed by many authors in the literature, although these have rarely been applied in short-term contexts, where other considerations and issues must be addressed. Therefore, this work aims to develop a robust hybrid methodology that is capable of making the most of the advantages fundamental and the hybrid model in a synergistic manner, while also providing insight as to how well these models perform across the year. Several methods have been utilised in this work in order to modify the hybridisation approach and the input datasets for enhanced predictive accuracy. The performance of this proposal has been analysed in the real case study of the Iberian power exchange and has outperformed other well-recognised and traditional methods. © 2019 by the authors.",Forecast combination; Fundamental-econometric models; Hybrid models; Power exchanges; Short-term electricity price forecasting,Commerce; Decision making; Forecasting; Econometric model; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combinations; Hybrid model; Power exchange; Power markets,Article
"Zarnikau J., Woo C.K., Zhu S., Baldick R., Tsai C.H., Meng J.",Electricity market prices for day-ahead ancillary services and energy: Texas,2019,1.0,"Applying a regression-based approach to a large sample of hourly observations for the seven-year period of January 1, 2011 to December 30, 2017, we explore determinants of day-ahead market (DAM) prices for ancillary services (ASs) and energy in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). For each GW increase in responsive reserve (RRS) or nonspinning reserve (NSRS) procurement quantities, we estimate price increases of about US$3.47 per MW per hour and US$5.63 per MW per hour, respectively; while the cost of an additional 1 GW of regulation up (REGUP) and regulation down (REGDN) is a much higher US$17 perMWper hour and US$31 per MW per hour, respectively. A US$1/MWh increase in the DAM energy pricetends to increase RRS and REGUP prices by nearly US$1 per MW per hour, about twice the estimated impact for NSRS that is not necessarily online when selected. The participation of interruptible loads to provide RRSs reduces the RRS price, and this effect increased nearly six-fold from the first to the second half of our sample time period. An increase in wind generation tends to decrease AS prices because it reduces the DAM energy price via the merit-order effect. Hence, Texas’s wind generation expansion has not raised ERCOT’s AS prices in our sample period, which is characterized by a stable AS requirement and declining natural gas prices. Going forward, however, Texas could face AS cost escalation due to the high REGUP and REGDN prices, should ERCOT’s requirement and procurement of those services increase due to rising renewable production. © 2019 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.",Ancillary services (ASS); Day-ahead market (DAM); Electric reliability council of texas (ERCOT); Electricity prices; Texas,,Article
"McHugh C., Coleman S., Kerr D., McGlynn D.",A Linear Polynomial NARMAX Model with Multiple Factors to Forecast Day-Ahead Electricity Prices,2019,1.0,"Forecasting algorithms are a valuable mechanism to aid in the prediction of future prices. Although various black-box modelling techniques have been applied to variations of this problem, we focus on the use of transparent models to enable understanding and interpretation of the developed model. We utilize a Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous input(NARMAX) for electricity price forecasting using multiple input factors. Energy data from a 14-week period in 2017 were analyzed to determine whether a NARMAX model could accurately predict day-ahead electricity prices and to check which input factors in the model were most significant. The model considered the closely correlated lags and included 13 input factors. There were two models developed in order to determine which variables played an important role in predicting future prices. Experimental results indicate that previous price, demand, gas, coal, and nuclear are the most significant factors that influence electricity prices. Gas was the highest weighted factor for both developed models. Previous price yielded the biggest Error Reduction Ratio(ERR), but when not included in the model, demand generated the biggest ERR value. To summarize a NARMAX model with an input regression lag of one and previous price included generates the best day-ahead forecast of electricity prices. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Energy market; Multiple factors; NARMAX,Artificial intelligence; Composite structures; Costs; Forecasting; Black box modelling; Electricity price forecasting; Energy markets; Error reduction ratios; Forecasting algorithm; Multiple factors; NARMAX; Nonlinear autoregressive moving average models; Power markets,Conference Paper

"Ferreira Â.P., Ramos J.G., Fernandes P.O.",A linear regression pattern for electricity price forecasting in the Iberian electricity market,2019,1.0,"The Iberian Market for Electricity resulted from a cooperation process developed by the Portuguese and Spanish administrations, aiming to promote the integration of the electrical systems of both countries. This common market consists of organised markets or power exchanges, and non-organised markets where bilateral over-the-counter trading takes place with or without brokers. Within this scenario, electricity price forecasts have become fundamental to the process of decision-making and strategy development by market participants. The unique characteristics of electricity prices such as non-stationarity, non-linearity and high volatility make this task very difficult. For this reason, instead of a simple time forecast, market participants are more interested in a causal forecast that is essential to estimate the uncertainty involved in the price. This work focuses on modelling the impact of various explanatory variables on the electricity price through a multiple linear regression analysis. The quality of the estimated models obtained validates the use of statistical or causal methods, such as the Multiple Linear Regression Model, as a plausible strategy to achieve causal forecasts of electricity prices in medium and long-term electricity price forecasting. From the evaluation of the electricity price forecasting for Portugal and Spain, in the year of 2017, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) were 9.02% and 12.02%, respectively.

"Shayegan-Rad A., Zangeneh A.",Optimal contract pricing of load aggregators for direct load control in smart distribution systems,2019,1.0,"Distribution system operators (DSOs) are interested in demand side participation programs as an efficient and secure resource to manage electricity supply and demand. However, it is usually difficult for DSOs to aggregate demand response of large/small consumers. Thus, in some electricity markets, an entity called an aggregator is defined to aggregate the load response of consumers. In this paper a bilevel scheduling model is proposed to determine the long-term optimal contract price between the DSO and aggregator for executing direct load control in smart distribution systems. The DSO and aggregator are considered as two different agents with individual objectives in the proposed bilevel scheduling model. On the one hand, the aggregator maximizes its profit by bidding load reduction of the large consumers to the DSO by executing a direct load control (DLC) mechanism, and on the other hand, the DSO tries to minimize its overall cost to supply all consumers. The DSO has two options to follow the variation of its consumers’ demand: purchasing energy from the electricity market and executing DLC programs. The bilevel programming formulation is transferred into an equivalent single level programming problem using its Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions. Moreover, the uncertainties of the electricity market price, demand of consumers, and generation of a wind power plant are modeled via point estimate method. Two typical case studies are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling model. © TÜBİTAK.",Bilevel optimization; Karush–Kuhn–Tucker; Load aggregator; Optimal contract pricing; Point estimate method,Aggregates; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Power markets; Scheduling; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Bi-level optimization; Bi-level programming; Demand side participations; Electricity supply and demands; Optimal contract; Optimality conditions; Point estimate method; Smart distribution systems; Electric load management,Article

"Ullah M.H., Paul S., Park J.-D.",Real-Time Electricity Price Forecasting for Energy Management in Grid-Tied MTDC Microgrids,2018,1.0,"In power market, electricity price forecasting is one of the challenging issues and it plays a significant role in grid-tied microgrid's (MG's) energy management systems (EMSs). Accurate forecasting can make precise economically beneficial decision not only in efficient resource scheduling, but also in real-time energy arbitrage. To maximize the profit, the idea is to buy energy at low price and sell at high. However, it is very complex and volatile task since the electricity prices are highly fluctuating in nature as a result of bidding competition among the suppliers and consumers in the electricity market. In this context, an artificial neural network based approach with an adaptive learning algorithm called resilient backpropagation was used to forecast the real-time electricity price throughout the year 2016 and forecasting error was analyzed. Result showed that the yearly mean error was 3.705IMWh and the mean absolute percentage error was in acceptable range of 5%-10% most of the cases. Also, the economical impact of the real-time electricity price forecasting to the MG's EMSs was analyzed, and a model predictive control based EMS for grid-tied multi-terminal DC (MTDC) microgrids was proposed in this paper. © 2018 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; DC OPF; Forecasting; Microgrid; MPC; Power market; Real-time energy management,Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation algorithms; Commerce; Electric power transmission networks; Electronic trading; Energy conversion; Energy management; Errors; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Model predictive control; Neural networks; Power markets; Predictive control systems; Adaptive learning algorithm; DC OPF; Electricity price forecasting; Mean absolute percentage error; Micro grid; Real-time electricity prices; Real-time energy management; Resilient backpropagation; Energy management systems,Conference Paper
"Dehghan-Banadaki A., Taufik T., Feliachi A.",Big data analytics in a day-ahead electricity price forecasting using tensorflow in restructured power systems,2018,1.0,"Although Smart Grids (in power systems) can bring beneficial features such as lowering the power market price, it enforces having a more comprehensive platform that can analyze a huge amount of data coming from sensor networks throughout the system. In this paper, a distributed and highly scalable machine learning platform called Tensorflow has been studied. Tensorflow is a Google's open source platform for artificial intelligence systems. The advantage of this package is that it can run parallel computations on distributed systems on a scale of thousands cores. Hence, big data analytics for real time applications are nowadays done with this package. In this paper, a case study considering a day-ahead price forecasting for power market of two European countries have been studied via Tensorflow. All the data gathered from the renewable energies and conventional generators, as well as weather forecasts, have been fed to the forecasting system to predict the day-ahead price of the market.

"Ben Amor S., Boubaker H., Belkacem L.",Forecasting electricity spot price for Nord Pool market with a hybrid k-factor GARMA–LLWNN model,2018,1.0,"This paper proposes a new hybrid approach, based on the combination of parametric and nonparametric models by adopting wavelet estimation approach, to model and predict the price electricity for Nord Pool market. Our hybrid methodology consists into two steps. The first step aims at modeling the conditional mean of the time series, using a generalized fractional model with k-factor of Gegenbauer termed the k-factor GARMA model; the parameters of this model are estimated using the wavelet approach based on the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT). The second step aims at estimating the conditional variance, so we adopt the local linear wavelet neural network (LLWNN) model. The proposed hybrid model is tested using the hourly log-returns of electricity spot price from the Nord Pool market. The empirical results were compared with the predictions of the ARFIMA–LLWNN, the k-factor GARMA–FIGARCH and the individual LLWNN models. It is shown that the proposed hybrid k-factor GARMA–LLWNN model outperforms all other competing methods. Hence it is a robust tool in forecasting time series. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",electricity price; forecasting; hybrid; k-factor GARMA; LLWNN,Commerce; Forecasting; Lakes; Parameter estimation; Power markets; Time series; Discrete wavelet packet transforms; Electricity prices; Forecasting electricity; Forecasting time series; hybrid; K-factor GARMA; LLWNN; Wavelet neural networks; Telecommunication traffic,Article
"Paulos J.P., Fidalgo J.N.",Load and electricity prices forecasting using generalized regression neural networks,2018,1.0,"Over time, the electricity price and energy consumption are increasingly growing their weight as prime foundations of the electrical sector, with their analysis and forecasts being targeted as key elements for the stable maintenance of electricity markets. The advent of smart grids is escalating the importance of forecasting because of the expected ubiquitous monitoring and growing complexity of a data-rich ever-changing milieu. So, the increasing data volatility will require forecasting tools able to rapidly readjust to a dynamic environment. The Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) approach is a solution that has recently re-emerged, emphasizing good performance, fast run-times and ease of parameterization. The merging of this model with more conventional methods allows us to obtain more sturdy solutions with shortened training times, when compared to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Overall, the performance of the GRNN, although slightly inferior to that of the ANN, is suitable, but linked to much lower training times. Ultimately, the GRNN would be a proper solution to blend with the latest smart grids features, which may require much reduced forecasting training times. © 2018 IEEE.",Data sampling; electricity prices forecasting; load forecasting; neural networks; performance evaluation,Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Smart power grids; Conventional methods; Data sampling; Dynamic environments; Electricity prices forecasting; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Generalized regression neural networks; Load forecasting; Performance evaluations; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper

The regression analysis focuses on the Nordic intraday market. With this paper we show that no price asymmetries exist, and that previous conclusions are non-robust to reanalysis with a different model specification. The model specification in this paper solves the issue with autocorrelation, which have troubled previous studies. Specifically, the order of autoregressive and moving average parts depend on the time of day, since the underlying autocorrelation structure of the price data differs noticeably with the time of day. © 2018 IEEE.",Econometrics; Follow-up Study; Intraday Market; Nordic Electricity Market; Price Formation,Autocorrelation; Forecasting; Power markets; Regression analysis; Specifications; Statistics; Auto-regressive; Autocorrelation structures; Econometrics; Follow-up Studies; Forecast errors; Model specifications; Price asymmetry; Price formation; Commerce,Conference Paper
"Teixeira J.P., Saraiva J.T.",Behavior of the Iberian electricity market prices in 2016 considering increasing values of feed-in generation,2018,1.0,"This paper results from the research conducted by the first author during the preparation of his MSc Thesis. This research aimed at investigating the impact on the market prices of the Iberian Electricity Market, MIBEL, due to increases of the feed-in generation, as such an increase is expected to occur in the next few years, namely for PV systems. This research was conducted using real market data publicly available in the web site of the Iberian Market Operator for 2016. To estimate this impact, for each trading hour of 2016 we considered new segments at price 0,0 /MWh to translate the priority given to this type of generation. These segments representing the new feed-in generation were then used together with the selling bids submitted by market agents to build the new aggregated selling curve. The new market price was finally obtained as the intersection of the new selling curve with the original buying curve, that was assumed unchanged. The global result indicates that if the feed-in generation increases by 25% regarding the values of 2016, then the average annual market price decreases by 6,57 % regarding the original value of 39,42 /MWh. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity market; Feed-in generation; Iberian Electricity Market; Impacts; Prices,Costs; Electric industry; Power markets; Sales; Iberian electricity market; Iberian market; Impacts; Market agents; Market price; Prices; PV system; Real markets; Commerce,Conference Paper
Dudek G.,Probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices using kernel regression,2018,1.0,"Electricity price forecasting has become crucial for energy companies due to its fundamental importance for decision making processes and operational management. Electricity price time series exhibit variable means, significant volatility and spikes, which places high demands on forecasting models. Moreover, in recent years researchers and practitioners have come to understand the limitations of point forecasts and require models to generate probabilistic forecasts. In contrast to point forecasts, the probabilistic forecasts takes the form of a predictive probability distribution over future quantities or events of interest. In the paper the probabilistic forecasting model based on Nadaraya- Watson estimator is proposed. The model generates the point forecasts as 24-component vectors representing day-ahead electricity prices. The probabilistic forecasts are calculated as quantiles based on the residual distribution for historical data forecasts. The performance of the proposed model is validated by testing on data from the Polish electricity market. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Kernel regression; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile forecasts,Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Decision making process; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Kernel regression; Operational management; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic forecasts; Residual distribution; Power markets,Conference Paper

"Itaba S., Mori H.",An Electricity Price Forecasting Model with Fuzzy Clustering Preconditioned ANN,2018,1.0,"In this paper, a hybrid model of fuzzy clustering and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is proposed for electricity price forecasting. Due to the complicated behavior of electricity price in power markets, market players are interested in maximizing profits while minimizing risks. As a result, more accurate models are required to deal with electricity price forecasting. This paper proposes a new method that makes use of fuzzy clustering preconditioned GRBFN (Generalized Radial Basis Function Network) to provide more accurate predicted prices. Fuzzy clustering plays a key role to prevent the number of learning data from decreasing at each cluster. GRBFN is one of efficient ANNs to approximate nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a modified GRBFN model is developed to improve the performance of GRBFN with the use of DA (Deterministic Annealing) clustering for the parameters initialization and EPSO (Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization) for optimizing the parameters of GRBFN.

"Varshney H., Sujil A., Kumar R.",A Singular Spectrum Analysis based Approach to Price Forecasting for a Day Ahead Electricity Market,2018,1.0,"Deregulation across various electricity markets created a need for an operational framework that has capability to run similar to the dynamics of real world commodity markets possessing the competitiveness to ensure long run stability, providing opportunity to every participant and maintaining the price level of commodity within the reach of consumer. The electricity framework takes into account the power system balancing constraints required to ensure its reliability and security. This complex structure with its aim of competitiveness motivated the participating entities to run the generating capacities at the optimum level, forced the operators to minimize the transmission losses and created an environment for the consumers to take the benefit of variable pricing conditions. Specially, these effects are reflected via short term electricity price forecasting (STPF) in a significant amount. The STPF created the required decision base for the entities to bid in market with an effective strategy of risk management to hedge against the highly volatile pricing events to ensure the required amount of liquidity and making better economic conditions while in case of large consumers, it helps to either curtail or schedule the loads to minimize the cost of energy. It also helps them to prepare an alternative strategy to make available the required energy via small private generating units during peak price hours. To account for different requirements of various entities, accurate price forecasting is a crucial task. The complexity of the price dynamics also involves the variations attributed to spatial effects in different operating regions such as calamities and extreme conditions. In this paper, Singular Spectrum Analysis based model is used to forecast the price. The simulations results show the accuracy of proposed model. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Neural network; Real time forecast; Singular spectrum analysis,Commerce; Competition; Complex networks; Costs; Deregulation; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power electronics; Risk management; Spectrum analysis; Day-ahead electricity market; Economic condition; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme conditions; Generating capacity; Real-time forecasts; Singular spectrum analysis; Transmission loss; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Zhao H., Guo S., Zhao H.",A multi-stage intelligent model for electricity price prediction based on the Beveridge-Nelson disintegration approach,2018,1.0,"Accurate electricity price prediction is key to the orderly operation of the electricity market. However, the uncertain, stochastic and fluctuant characteristics of electricity pricees make prediction difficult. With the aim of solving this issue, this investigation proposed a multi-stage intelligent model integrating the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition (B-N-D) model, the least square support vector machine (LSSVM), and a nature-inspired optimization model named the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). Firstly, the B-N-D model was utilized to decompose the hourly electricity price time series into determinacy component, periodic trend, and stochastic item. Secondly, the WOA-LSSVM model was proposed to forecast the future hourly data of three components respectively, of which the optimal parameters of LSSVM were determined by using WOA. Finally, the future hourly electricity price data were computed by multiplying the forecasted data of those terms. To verify the validity of the proposed electricity price prediction model in this paper, five comparison approaches based on the B-N-D approach were selected, which are autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), single LSSVM, LSSVM optimized by the fruit-fly optimization algorithm (FOA), LSSVM optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) models, and WOA-LSSVM without B-N-D. By comparatively analyzing the error criteria values of the above models through testing on the objective data of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) electricity market collected from 11 December 2017 to 18 December 2017, from 15 January 2018 to 22 January 2018, and from 1 February 2018 to 25 February 2018, we conclude that the constructed intelligent model in this paper can greatly enhance the prediction precision of electricity prices. © 2018 by the authors.",Beveridge-Nelson decomposition approach; Electricity price prediction; Least square support vector machine; Multi-stage intelligent model; Whale optimization algorithm,accuracy assessment; algorithm; electricity generation; electricity industry; least squares method; numerical model; optimization; prediction; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; United States; Cetacea,Article

Price forecasting is also considered as an important management goal for market participants since it forms the basis of maximizing profits. These markets are usually organized in power pools and administrated by the independent system operator (ISO). The aim of this study is to examine the performance of asymmetric neuro-fuzzy network models for day-ahead electricity price forecasting in the ISO New England market. The implemented model has been developed with two alternative defuzzification models. The first model follows the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang scheme, while the second follows the traditional centre of average method. A clustering scheme is utilised as a pre-processing step to derive the necessary number of clusters and eventually the number of fuzzy rules in the network.

"Chanda C.K., Pal J., Paul B., Pathak M.K.",On transmission congestion management strategies and forecasting locational marginal prices in a deregulated competitive power market,2018,1.0,"To maximize both the social benefits of the customers and the efficiency of the transmission network system, the constraints of the transmission networks and the security level of the power system must be essentially controlled. In a competitive power market, congestion problem becomes an obstacle since it directly influences nodal pricing at various buses in the system. To keep a flat price profile at every node, dispatching of generating units and also load curtailment in a system may be required. Different pricing at every node or LMPs (Locational Marginal Price) are due to congestion of the network. The LMP at any node is the total cost of the incremental outputs of the marginal generators to deliver one unit of energy at that node without increasing the flow of the congested line. This paper presents a novel method to minimize total cost in respect of flow tariff, load costs, generator bids, zero congestion surplus and choosing properly the reference bus in a highly congested power system network. An improved LMP has been defined in this context which takes into account all of the above factors. The LMPs are calculated by incorporating Shift Factor (SF) based DC-Optimal power flow (DC-OPF) model. The proposed method has been applied in a four bus network and the results obtained have been found to be capable of eradicating the local market power monopoly in a system. © 2017 IEEE.",Congestion; Congestion-surplus; DC-OPF; LMP; Shift Factor,Buses; Commerce; Deregulation; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Power markets; Traffic congestion; Competitive power markets; Congestion; Congestion-surplus; DC-OPF; Locational marginal prices; Power system networks; Shift factors; Transmission congestion management; Costs,Conference Paper

"Saâdaoui F., Mrad M.",Stochastic modelling of the price-volume relationship in electricity markets: Evidence from the Nordic energy exchange,2017,1.0,"The analysis of the interactions between price and transaction volume, conducted as part of a financial market, is one of the central themes of the financial theory. However, with the emergence of power exchanges and despite the expansion of the research sphere in this context, this issue had not been sufficiently addressed.

The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the nature of the relationship between price changes and trading volume in the Nordic power market (Nord Pool), which is one of the largest energy markets worldwide. Through statistical timing analysis of the price-volume covariation, we reconsider this joint modelling, but only settling for daily observations, which makes the specificity of this work. Contrary to most comparable works, which were based on high frequency data, we chose to omit intraday observations to circumvent the repercussion of the daily seasonality on one side and ensure more lucidity and clairvoyance to a wider horizon on the other. The empirical results go in line with our expectations and provide support for the claim that there exists a significant reciprocal causality between prices and trading volume.

"Mori H., Itaba S.",Integration of improved GRBFN with fuzzy clustering for electricity price forecasting,2017,1.0,"This paper proposes an efficient model with a hybrid intelligent system that consists of fuzzy c-Varieties of fuzzy clustering and GRBFN (Generalized Radial Basis Function Network) of ANN (Artificial Neural Network) for electricity price forecasting. In recent years, electric power system deregulation has been spread in the world so that electricity power markets become more complicated. Due to the highly nonlinearity of electricity price time-series, more accurate forecasting model are required to purchase and/or sell electricity in power markets. In this paper, a hybrid intelligent method is proposed to provide one-step ahead predicted values of electricity price with a couple of strategies; Fuzzy c-Varieties and improved GRBFN. The former is used to classify input data into some fuzzy clusters while the latter is employed to provide the predicted electricity price at each cluster by applying Deterministic Annealing clustering to the determination of the initial values of parameters in the Gaussian functions. The reason why Fuzzy c-Varieties are used is to increases the number of data by allowing each data to be belonged to more than two clusters. The proposed method is tested for real data of ISO New England, USA. © 2017 IEEE.",clustering; DAclustering; electricity price; forecasting model; fuzzy c-Varieties; GRBFN; neural network; power market; pre-filtering,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Intelligent computing; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Soft computing; clustering; DAclustering; Electricity prices; Forecasting modeling; Fuzzy c-varieties; GRBFN; Pre-filtering; Power markets,Conference Paper
"De Marcos R.A., Bello A., Reneses J.",Short-term forecasting of electricity prices with a computationally efficient hybrid approach,2017,1.0,"Electricity price forecasting models are of great importance for market participants due to their considerable volatility, especially in deregulated and competitive contexts. As a result, these models are highly demanded, especially in day-today applications, which require not only accurate results, but also fast responsiveness. Taking these needs into account, this work proposes a novel short-term electricity forecasting approach by means of a hybrid model, combining econometric and fundamental methods. In order to validate this work's proposed method under complex price dynamics, the model has been tested for the Iberian electricity market case, and further verified by comparing its performance with other, more traditional, forecasting models. © 2017 IEEE.",Econometric Models; Electricity Markets; Fundamental Models; Hybrid Models; Short-Term Forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Power markets; Computationally efficient; Econometric model; Electricity price forecasting; Fundamental models; Hybrid model; Iberian electricity market; Market participants; Short-term forecasting; Forecasting,Conference Paper
"Bertrand G., Papavasiliou A.",Optimal dispatch of wind farms facing market prices,2017,1.0,"At present, wind power producers (WPP) are paid following feed-in tariffs in Belgium. This system will come to an end soon due to its high cost and the producers will have to bid in the day-ahead market. As wind owners cannot forecast their production perfectly, they will face imbalance costs or revenues. Imbalance price forecasting is therefore a critical problem. In this paper, we implement a machine learning model to assess the usefulness of introducing exogenous variables in imbalance price forecasting. This method shows improved results compared to classical methods. Since the imbalance price is obtained by the marginal cost of producing the missing energy, the strategic behaviour of a WPP will influence the imbalance price. In this paper, we propose a way to represent this influence as well as a formulation of a model to obtain the optimal bidding strategy in that situation. This model has been cast as a convex quadratic program that can readily be solved using a commercial solver. © 2017 IEEE.",Electricity market; Imbalance market; Machine learning; Optimization; Wind power,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Forecasting; Learning systems; Optimization; Power markets; Quadratic programming; Wind power; Classical methods; Commercial solvers; Critical problems; Exogenous variables; Machine learning models; Optimal bidding strategy; Price forecasting; Quadratic programs; Costs,Conference Paper
"Cigler J., Váňa Z., Mužík T., Šulc J., Ferkl L.",Usage of spot market prices prediction for demand side management,2017,1.0,"This paper discusses the issue of demand side management, in particular control of the output power of heat pumps based on the spot market electricity price. The main presumptions are the ability of controlled HVAC system to shift energy load on the customer's side and sufficient credibility of an energy price prognosis on the electricity provider's side. The paper first presents current situation in the Czech republic with electricity tariffs legislations, which have to be followed so that the proposed method is applicable in practice. It is shown that for successful implementation, it is required to have an energy load model, model of the accumulation as well as parameters of the heat pump. For the energy load model, statistical black box methods are used, while the other models are based on first principles. The models are together with the prediction of spot market price used within model predictive control framework resulting in cost savings higher than 10%. © 2016 EUCA.",,Climate control; Commerce; Costs; Demand side management; Electric utilities; Heat pump systems; Model predictive control; Black box method; Current situation; Czech Republic; Electricity prices; Electricity tariff; Energy prices; First principles; On the spots; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Pan K., Shi W., Wang X., Li J.",A short-term marginal price forecasting model based on ensemble learning,2017,1.0,"This The system marginal price reflects the short-term supply and demand of electricity goods in the electricity market, which is an important economic link to the participating members of the market. The traditional prediction model has a large error and low generalization ability to forecast the short-term marginal price. Therefore, this paper proposes an ensemble learning algorithm for short-term marginal price forecasting based on AdaBoost. In this paper, the main factors influencing the short-term marginal electricity price are analyzed. Based on the AdaBoost algorithm, the short-term marginal electricity price forecasting problem is modeled. Four prediction models (C4.5, CART, Linear neural network, BP) are compared, and a short - term marginal price forecasting algorithm is proposed. By comparing the actual values with the predicted values, our proposed algorithm is superior to SVM and BP algorithm, which has high application values in power plant engineering. © 2017 IEEE.",AdaBoost; Integrated learning; Short term; System marginal price,Adaptive boosting; Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Photonic integration technology; Ensemble learning algorithm; Generalization ability; High application value; Integrated learning; Marginal electricities; Short term; Short-term marginal prices; System marginal price; Power markets,Conference Paper

"Mohamed A., El-Hawary M.E.",On optimization of SVMs kernels and parameters for electricity price forecasting,2016,1.0,"Forecasting electricity price allows market participants to make informed and sound decisions. Selecting the best training variables is often involved in forecasting in order to obtain optimal prediction. Support Vector Regression (SVR) provides an effective method to fit data and find minimal risk slack variables around a fit line. The best fit depends on the selected input feature set and the tuning of hyper-parameters. In this paper, various SVM optimization solvers were utilized to train and optimize the SVM parameters to speed up the quadratic programming convergence and increase the forecasting accuracy. Various kernels were used with the SVM Regression model and a comparison of their performance was made. Our experiments demonstrated that the RBF Kernel is the most efficient.

"Pandey A.K., Chandra D., Tripathi M.M.",Short-term price forecasting using new wavelet-neural network with data pre filtering in ISO New England market,2016,1.0,"Effective load and price forecasting in presence of the noisy data collection process and complicated load features is important in deregulated power system. This paper presents a method of wavelet neural networks with data pre-filtering for short term price forecasting. The key idea is to use a spike filtering technique to detect spikes in load data and correct them. Wavelet decomposition is then used to decompose the filtered loads into multiple components at different frequencies, separate neural networks are applied to capture the features of individual components, and results of neural networks are then combined to form the final forecasts. To perform moving forecasts, six dedicated wavelet neural networks are used based on test results. Numerical testing demonstrates the effects of data pre-filtering and the accuracy of wavelet neural networks based on a data set from ISO New England. © 2016 IEEE.",Artificial Neural Network (ANN); Meanabsolute Percentage Error (MAPE); Pre-filtering; Short-term Price Forecasting (STPF); Wavelets and Filter Bank,Costs; Energy conservation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power transformers; Statistical tests; Deregulated power systems; Different frequency; Individual components; Mape; Multiple components; Pre-filtering; Short-term price forecasting; Wavelet neural networks; Wavelet decomposition,Conference Paper
"Swinand G.P., Natraj A., O'Mahoney A.",The European Target Model and the impact of implicit auctions on interconnection capacity prices,2016,1.0,"This paper studies the impact of the European Target Model (ETM) on day-ahead electricity interconnection capacity prices between Great Britain (GB) and France (FR). We implement an econometric approach using data from the Interconnection-France-Angleterre (IFA); such an approach controls for factors that may influence prices besides the ETM. The modelling indicates that the target model raised day-ahead capacity prices for the direction FR→GB by €7.45 to €8.07/MWh. Results for the GB→FR direction are sensitive to the model used, but range from €0.475/MWh to €10.65/MWh, with the higher value coming from a censored regression model. Using the model's prediction, adding capacity of 1000MW would roughly reduce prices by €6. Gas price differentials account for about €1 of the interconnection price. The overall indication is that the ETM has achieved some of its initial goals in allowing interconnection prices to rise and more fully reflect congestion rents and the need for investment. Our work should be taken as preliminary, as many factors, such as long-term contracts, may further influence conclusions. © 2016 IEEE.",econometrics; power system economics; power system interconnection,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Electric power system interconnection; Investments; Regression analysis; Statistics; Approach controls; Censored regression; econometrics; Electricity interconnections; Interconnection capacity; Long-term contracts; Power system economics; Power system interconnection; Power markets,Conference Paper

"Vardanyan Y., Hesamzadeh M.R.",Modeling regime switching in day-ahead market prices using Markov model,2016,1.0,"The accurate price forecasting of electricity market is crucial for profit maximizing producers and consumers in liberalized power markets. In all market places (day-ahead, intra-day and real-time) accurate price prediction is needed to generate optimal bids and maximize the profit. This paper first presents three methods for forecasting day-ahead market prices, namely Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heterosedastic (GARCH), Holt-Winter (HW) and Mean Reversion and Jump Diffusion (MRJD). These methods are based on three broad methodologies of time series analysis, exponential-smoothing and stochastic processes. The dynamics of hourly prices in day-ahead market are varying from day to day. Each forecasting tool is suitable to capture one type of price dynamics. To capture this phenomenon, we combine GARCH, HW and MRJD methods using proposed Markov switch. The proposed Markov model is tested using Nordic day-ahead prices. © 2016 IEEE.",Day-ahead prices; forecasting tools; Markov switch,Commerce; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Markov processes; Power markets; Profitability; Smart power grids; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive; Day ahead market; Day-ahead prices; Exponential smoothing; Forecasting tools; Price forecasting; Price prediction; Regime switching; Costs,Conference Paper
"Saini D., Saxena A.",Electric price forecast using interbreed approach of linear regression and SVM,2016,1.0,"Electricity price forecasting is a hypercritical issue due to the involvement of consumers and producers in electricity markets. Price forecasting plays an important role in planning and managing economic operations related with the electrical power (bidding, trading) and other decisions related with load shedding and generation rescheduling.

This paper explores an interbreed technique based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and linear regression to predict the day ahead electricity price using historical data as a raw insert. Different 27 linear regression models are formed to create initial framework for forecasting engine. Comparison of the performance of different forecasting engines is carried out on the basis of error indices namely Mean Square Error (MSE), Sum Square Error (SSE) and other conventional error indices.

"Maisano J., Radchik A., Skryabin I.",A method of forecasting wholesale electricity market prices,2016,1.0,"In this paper, we employ a fundamental principle of classical mechanics known as the least-action principle to model the complex relationship between expected load and expected price in electricity spot markets.We consider markets that feature a centralized electricity dispatch system that optimizes grid parameters to determine the minimum spot nodal prices. Using the example of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) and a calibrated stochastic demand model, we develop a mathematical approach that determines the price evolution, including intraday and seasonal features. The proposed model links the concept of a deterministically modeled price with stochastically modeled demand. The demand-price relationship is complex, and it must include not only the level of demand within the constraint of maximum generating capacity, but also the change in demand within the constraints of generator ramping rates. While this paper uses the NEM as an example, the proposed approach is applicable to any energy market that satisfies the above conditions. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.",Electricity market; Forecasting; Least-action principle (lap); National electricity market (nem); Spot price forecasting; Structural model,,Article
Sisodia G.S.,Methodology for Electricity Price Forecasting in the Long Run,2016,1.0,"The long-term forecasting of electricity price has received less attention in literature. A probable reason for less attention is uncertainty about various factors in the long run, for instance- oil price, regulatory policies, political intervention, technological changes, energy mix, grid operations, etc. As a general operation, energy generated through different sources is supplied to grid which is finally composed of ""energy mix"". A large decision on the finalisation of retail electricity price could also depend on the load factors and capacity utilization of energy generating plants. A majority of the studies dealing with electricity price forecast electricity prices in the short run. Whereas, the aim of this study is to present a long-term perspective by introducing a methodology framework that consists of various parameters associated with the forecasting of electricity price in the long run. To the best of our understanding, this framework has not been proposed in existing energy literature, and therefore, under an assumption that future electricity market will be dominated by clean energy generation, this study brings novelty to the literature.",carbon price; electricity price forecasting; energy mix; long run electricity prices,Carbon; Costs; Environmental technology; Forecasting; Carbon price; Clean energy generation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Energy mix; Long-term forecasting; Long-term perspective; Technological change; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Mori H., Nakano K.",An Efficient Hybrid Intelligent Method for Electricity Price Forecasting,2016,1.0,"In this paper an efficient method is proposed for electricity price forecasting. This paper focuses on Locational Marginal Price (LMP) that efficiently maintains power markets by alleviating transmission network congestion. There are complicated behaviors of the time series due to uncertain factors in the power markets. From a standpoint of market players, a sophisticated method is required to forecast LMP effectively. The proposed method makes use of the hybridization of GP (Gaussian Process) of hierarchical Bayesian estimation, EPSO (Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization) of evolutionary computation and fuzzy c-means of allowing data to belong to two or more clusters. EPSO is used to improve the accuracy of parameters in MAP (Maximum a Posteriori) estimation for GP. The use of fuzzy c-mean is useful for increasing the number of learning data for GP to deal with spikes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated for real LMP data. © 2016 The Authors.",clustering; EPSO; evolutionary computation; forecasting; fuzzy c-mean; Gaussian Process;Hierarchical Bayesian Estimation,Adaptive systems; Bayesian networks; Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); clustering; Electricity price forecasting; EPSO; Evolutionary particle swarm optimizations; Fuzzy C mean; Hierarchical bayesian; Hybrid intelligent method; Locational marginal prices; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Mori H., Nakano K.",EPSO-based Gaussian process for electricity price forecasting,2015,1.0,"In this paper, a new method is proposed for Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) forecasting in Smart Grid. The marginal cost is required to supply electric power to incremental loads in case where a certain node increases power demands in a balanced power system. LMP plays an important role to maintain economic efficiency in electric power markets in a way that electricity flows from a low-cost area to high-cost ones and the transmission network congestion is alleviated. The power market players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their aim is achieved. This paper presents the Gaussian Process (GP) technique that comes from the extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in which hierarchical Bayesian estimation is introduced to express the model parameters as the probabilistic variables. The advantage is that the model accuracy of GP is better than others. GP is integrated with k-means of clustering to improve the performance of GP. Also, this paper makes use of the Mahalanobis kernel in GP rather than the Gaussian one so that GP is generalized to approximate nonlinear systems. EPSO of evolutionary computation is applied to GP to determine the parameters of the kernel function.

"Pereira J.P., Rodrigues P.M.M.",The impact of wind generation on the mean and volatility of electricity prices in Portugal,2015,1.0,"This paper analyzes the impact of wind power generation on the mean and variance of electricity wholesale spot prices in Portugal. The Portuguese market is a natural setting to measure the effect of intermittent renewable generation on electricity prices, as the share of wind in total load demand is one of the largest in the world. Using daily data from 2007 to 2014, we estimate an ARX-EGARCHX model where wind generation and total load demand enter as exogenous explanatory variables for the electricity price. The results show that wind generation reduces the average price level, while it increases the price volatility. Both the mean and volatility effects are substantially stronger for day-time peak prices than for night-time base-load prices. © 2015 IEEE.",EGARCH; Electricity price; Intermittent wind power,Commerce; Electric power generation; Power markets; Wind power; EGARCH; Electricity prices; Explanatory variables; Price levels; Price volatility; Renewable generation; Volatility effects; Wind generation; Costs,Conference Paper

Power producers and customers use short term price forecasts to manage and plan for bidding approaches, and hence increasing the utility's profit and energy efficiency as well. The main challenge in forecasting electricity price is when dealing with non-stationary and high volatile price series. Some of the factors influencing this volatility are load behavior, weather, fuel price and transaction of import and export due to long term contract. This paper proposes the use of Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization technique to predict daily electricity prices in Ontario. The selection of input data and LSSVM's parameter held by GA are proven to improve accuracy as well as efficiency of prediction. A comparative study of proposed approach with other techniques and previous research was conducted in term of forecast accuracy, where the results indicate that (1) the LSSVM with GA outperforms other methods of LSSVM and Neural Network (NN), (2) the optimization algorithm of GA gives better accuracy than Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and cross validation.

"Cochran S.J., Mansur I., Odusami B.",Equity market implied volatility and energy prices: A double threshold GARCH approach,2015,1.0,"This study investigates the role of VIX in determining the returns and return volatilities of oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas. A double threshold GARCH(1,1) methodology is utilized where the VIX index is used as the threshold regime change indicator. Daily data from January 4, 1999, to December 31, 2013, are used. A sub-period analysis covering only the financial crisis period of January 2, 2007, to December 31, 2009, is also performed. This study provides evidence that the level of equity market volatility (i.e., VIX) that triggers a regime shift is commodity specific. The results also indicate that the threshold VIX values are time varying. Furthermore, natural gas prices appear to withstand considerably more volatility in the equity market than do the prices of other energy commodities. This relationship is even more pronounced during the financial crisis period. Approximately 70% and 50% of the estimated coefficients display asymmetric sensitivities due to regime changes during the entire period and the crisis period, respectively. The findings have practical implications as the underlying volatility of an asset plays a significant role in determining its associated activity in the futures markets. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Double threshold GARCH; Energy prices; G12; Q40; VIX,Commerce; Costs; Natural gas; Double threshold GARCH; Energy prices; G12; Q40; VIX; Financial markets; commodity price; energy market; financial crisis; index method; methodology; natural gas,Article
"Velasco J.M., Gonzalez-Perez B., Minana G., Lopez V., Caro R.",An explanatory analysis of electricity prices within day-ahead Spanish energy market by using a graphical automatization with R,2014,1.0,"Since 1998, the Spanish and Portuguese Administrations began to share a common path in building the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). This cooperation has been very successful, not only for its contribution to the existence of an electricity market on an Iberian level, but also on a European scale, as a significant step in building the Internal Energy Market. The price of electricity in the MIBEL is very changeable. This creates a lot of uncertainty and risk in market actors. Due to continuous changes in demand and marginal price adjustment, buyers and sellers can not know in advance the evolution of prices. Our interest is to study of this uncertainty since the perspective of the buyer and not the seller's perspective. The aim of this work is to develop a graphical analysis of the variables involved in the Spanish Energy Market in order to explain the electric price and provide to small traders, that could be interested in participating in that market, better knowledge of the schedule. On the other hand, large industrial consumers use this information to design strategies to optimize its production capacity and improve their production costs. In this article the variable of interest is the marginal price instead of demand. This paper provides a graphical analysis by means of an easily reproducible automatization with the R project for statistical computing that allows to explore, visualize and understand the key variables that define its final value. Mibel 2011 and 2012 data are used for ilustrations.

"Grossi L., Nan F.",Robust self exciting Threshold autoregressive models for electricity prices,2014,1.0,"In this paper we suggest the use of robust GM-SETAR (Self Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive) processes to model and forecast electricity prices observed on deregulated markets. The robustness of the model is achieved by extending to time series the generalized M-type (GM) estimator first introduced for independent multivariate data. As it has been shown in a very recent paper [1], the polynomial weighting function over-performs the classical ordinary least squares method when extreme observations are present. The main advantage of estimating robust SETAR models is the possibility to capture two very well-known stylized facts of electricity prices: nonlinearity produced by changes of regimes and the presence of sudden spikes due to inelasticity of demand. The forecasting performance of the model applied to the Italian electricity market (IPEX) is improved by the introduction of predicted demand as an exogenous regressor. The availability of this regressor is a particular feature of the Italian market. By means of prediction performance indexes and tests, it will be shown that this regressor plays a crucial role and that robust methods improve the overall forecasting performance of the model. © 2014 IEEE.",extreme values; GM estimator; nonlinear models; Terms-Electricity prices,Commerce; Deregulation; Estimation; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Extreme value; Forecasting performance; GM estimator; Non-linear model; Ordinary least squares methods; Prediction performance; Self-Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive models; Terms-Electricity prices; Costs,Conference Paper
"Pezic M., De Juan M.Q., García-Martos C., Sánchez M.J.",Unit commitment and electricity prices forecasting for market strategy preparation in interconnected systems,2014,1.0,"In this paper we present a solution for building a better strategy to take part in external electricity markets. For an optimal strategy development, both the internal system costs as well as the future values of the series of electricity prices in external markets need to be known. But in practice, the real problems that must be faced are that both future electricity prices and costs are unknown. Thus, the first ones must be modeled and forecasted and the costs must be calculated. Our methodology for building an optimal strategy consists of three steps: The first step is modeling and forecasting market prices in external systems. The second step is the cost calculation on internal system taking into account the expected prices in the first step. The third step is based on the results of the previous steps, and consists of preparing the bids for external markets. The main goal is to reduce consumers' costs unlike many others that are oriented to increase GenCo's profits. © 2014 IEEE.",Dynamic factor analysis; Electricity Prices Forecasting; Market strategy; MILP; Unit Commitment (UC),Commerce; Forecasting; Integer programming; Optimal systems; Dynamic factor analysis; Electricity prices forecasting; Market strategies; MILP; Unit Commitment; Costs,Conference Paper
"Azuma T., Watanabe T.",Stability analysis of load frequency control systems with real-time pricing and external signals,2013,1.0,"This paper discusses stability of a load frequency control system with real-time pricing. The load frequency control system considered in this paper also depends on an external signal. The external signal corresponds to the predicted electrical load in spot pricing and is called as load-predicted signal. The load frequebcy control system with the external signal can be derived as an uncertain linear system. Since the uncertain linear system is described as an extended uncertain linear system which consists of monomials about the state, stability of the extened system is analized based on sum of squares. From the result of stability analysis, the admissible stability margin is obtained for the load-predicted signal.

"Mohammadinia M., Borzouie M., Shakeri H., Barband S.A.",Providing optimal pricing strategy for buyers' energy packages in Iran power exchange,2013,1.0,"In contrast to the current existing whole-sale electricity market of Iran in that buyers may not impact the pricing strategy of the electricity, establishment of the energy exchange can enable both buyers and sellers to interact through a two-way bidding system until both parties agree to execute a deal. The significance of such a market for buyers (i.e. distribution companies) would be reflected in potentially reduced cost of energy ownership that is based on different energy offering packages. This paper deploy the 24-hours SARIMA model in order to predict the price of energy packages in the whole sale market and then presents a novel method based on minimisation of the cost function to achieve an optimal pricing strategy in various symbol of power exchange. Additionally, the effect of inflation has been specifically accounted. The overall solution would assist the buyer to determine the optimal price and amount of energy, it would require buying.",,Bidding systems; Buyers and sellers; Distribution companies; Electricity market; Energy exchanges; Optimal pricing; Power exchange; Pricing strategy; Commerce; Costs; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Exhibitions; Optimization; Sales,Conference Paper
"Liu H., Vain J.",An agent-based modeling for price-responsive demand simulation,2013,1.0,"With the ongoing deployment of smart grids, price-responsive demand is playing an increasingly important role in the paradigm shifting of electricity markets. Taking a multi-agent system modeling approach, this paper presents a conceptual platform for discovering dynamic pricing solutions that reflect the varying cost of electricity in the wholesale market as well as the level of demand participation, especially regarding household customers and small and medium sized businesses. At first, an agent-based meta-model representing various concepts, relations, and structure of agents is constructed. Then a domain model can be instantiated based upon the meta-model. Finally, a simulation experiment is developed for use case demonstration and model validation. The simulation is for the supplier to obtain the profit-maximizing demand curve which has such a shape that it follows the spot price curve in inverse ratio. The result suggests that this multi-agent-based construct could contribute to 1) estimating the impacts of various timevarying tariff options on peak-period energy use through simulation, before any experimental pilots can be carried out; 2) modeling the electricity retail market evolving interactions in a systematic manner; 3) inducing innovative simulation configurations.",Agent-based modeling; Computational intelligence; Demand response; Electricity markets; Meta-model; Multi-agent systems; Real-time pricing; Smart grids,Agent-based model; Demand response; Electricity market; Meta model; Real time pricing; Smart grid; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computational methods; Costs; Information systems; Mathematical models; Multi agent systems; Smart power grids; Computer simulation,Conference Paper
Haugom E.,Predicting realized volatility for nord pool forward prices by including volatility spillover and covariance effects,2013,1.0,"In this study, the current literature on volatility prediction in financial electricity markets is extended by incorporating volatility spillover and covariance effects. This is done using the concept of realized volatility and covariance with three financial electricity contracts traded at the Nord Pool exchange. A recently developed robust method to separate the total variation into continuous and jump components is applied. The results indicate that volatility spillover and covariance effects are clearly present in the three different contracts. The prediction accuracy is improved significantly when utilizing a multivariate framework (vector autoregressions) rather than a univariate one. © 2013, Infopro digital.

"Nerves A.C., Bunyi J.E.A.",A no-arbitrage approach to pricing of Flexible Electricity Contracts considering transmission line rentals,2012,1.0,"This study considers the impact of transmission line rentals on the pricing of Flexible Electricity Contracts, which allow flexible scheduling of electric energy, using a no-arbitrage approach. A Flexible Electricity Contract requires the buyer or seller to schedule the amount of energy to be supplied for each time interval. Given stochastic models for spot and line rental prices, this approach determines the optimal price of the Flexible Electricity Contract by determining the opportunities that can be advantageous to the buyer or seller, and setting the price of the contract such that there is no arbitrage. The stochastic spot prices are modeled using autoregressive models. On the other hand, stochastic line rental prices are modeled using simple linear regression, with the spot prices as the predictor variable. Based on the said stochastic models for the spot prices and line rental prices, the optimal contract price is determined using Monte Carlo simulation. Simulations are conducted using spot and line rental price information from the Philippine Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. Analysis performed in this study shows that considering transmission line rentals has a significant impact on the pricing of Flexible Electricity Contracts. Furthermore, this study also considers the impact of daily and hourly scheduling provisions on the contract prices. © 2012 IEEE.",arbitrage; contract pricing; electricity market; flexible electricity contracts; Monte-Carlo simulation; transmission line rental,arbitrage; Contract pricing; Electricity contracts; Electricity market; Monte Carlo Simulation; Electric lines; Electricity; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Planning; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Transmission line theory; Costs,Conference Paper

"Smolen J., Chen Z.",Analysis of price peaks on Danish electricity market,2012,1.0,"The year 2010 has shown unusually high spread between East and West Denmark wholesale electricity prices. The difference was particularly visible during certain hours of the year when prices in East Denmark exceeded 1000 EUR/MWh level. This paper provides detailed analysis on the issue supported by the market model created in Plexos software. Reasons for price spikes in 2010 are presented and forecast for the future years is provided. Results suggest that the main reason behind high electricity prices in East Denmark in 2010 was mothballing of production units which resulted in the real availability of generation capacity in the region being much lower than that reported. As thermal electricity sources are expected to be further replaced by wind generation during the next decade, the risks of price spikes in the region may increase. © 2012 IEEE.",electricity price; market model; wind power generation,Denmark; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Generation capacity; Market model; Price spike; Production units; Thermal electricity; Wholesale electricity; Wind generation; Commerce; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Electricity; Wind power; Costs,Conference Paper

"Illing B., Bretschneider P.",Flat-rate pricing for grid usage in distribution grids,2012,1.0,The increasing change of the electrical power system caused by the influence of renewable energy on the power flow in the distribution grid mainly affects the distribution system operators. They have to cope with the changed power flow as well as to account for congestions. Therefore they have to take influence on these power flows. One opportunity is represented by variable grid fees which enable a causation-based allocation of grid costs and a higher predictability concerning power system planning. According to the development of pricing in the communication sector flat-rate pricing for grid usage seems to be an appropriate solution. Therefore an approach based on a flatrate tariff with an additional usage-sensitive component is developed. © 2012 IEEE.,distribution grid; flat-rate; Grid fee; grid usage; pricing; renewable energy,Costs; Electric power systems; Distribution grid; flat-rate; Grid fee; grid usage; Renewable energies; Economics,Conference Paper
"Flórez J.Z., Besançon G., Martinez J.J., Davelaar F.",Explicit price method for coordinated control and hydro-power production example,2012,1.0,"In the context of a general renewed interest in decomposition-coordination control approaches, and in the more particular continuity of former studies of the authors in that respect, the present paper focuses on some so-called price coordination method based on distributed receding horizon controllers, here emphasizing possible explicit schemes both at the controllers level and at the coordinator level. This can clearly be of interest for the control of large scale systems as they arise in power management issues, and is illustrated with an example of hydro-power application. In short, the coordinator computes a price vector and distributes it to the various subsystems composing the overall system to be controlled, on the basis of the predicted control strategies that each of them communicate to it. The main point is that the coordinator here takes advantage of the explicit solutions for local linear Receding Horizon Controls, to globally update those price values in an explicit way as well. This method is illustrated with simulations of an industrial Hydro-Power Valley case-study, using real-data from French main electricity provider EDF (Electricité de France), and a comparison with the more classical coordination scheme based on a gradient algorithm is presented.",Decomposition/coordination; Explicit control; Hydro-power plants; MPC; Price coordination,Controllers; Electric power generation; Electric power system control; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Large scale systems; Control of large-scale systems; Coordination methods; Decomposition-coordination control; Hydro power production; Hydropower plants; Price coordination; Receding horizon control; Receding horizon controllers; Power control,Conference Paper
"Menniti D., Scordino N., Sorrentino N.",A novel approach to forecast day-ahead electricity prices by means of neural networks using groups of similar hours,2012,1.0,"Forecasting short-term electricity market prices has been the focus of several studies in recent years. Although various approaches have been examined, achieving sufficiently low forecasting errors has not always been possible. However, certain applications, such as demandside management, do not require exact values for future prices, but utilize average values as the basis for making short-term scheduling decisions. With the aim of enhancing the accuracy of the day-ahead electricity price forecasting, field records of the Italian electricity market have been correlated so as to identify a number of blocks of hours, characterized by similarity of price. This paper thus proposes an approach to forecast the day-ahead electricity prices by means of a number of Neural Networks (NNs), with such a number being equal to the number of groups of hours with similarity of price, and with each NN forecasting the mean price over the hours belonging to the related group, as previously determined. Simulation results show that the fundamental and novel contribution of identifying, firstly, the membership of an hour to a particular group of hours, clustered according to their similarity of price, and then forecasting day-ahead prices for the resulting number of groups of hours performs fairly well if compared with other forecasting techniques, either on an hourly or on an average basis, in terms of mean absolute and absolute percentage errors, as well as of variance. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.",Back propagation; Electricity market prices; Forecasting; Neural network; Time series,,Article

Due to the day-time variations in load and thereby electrical energy price, it is wise to use different models for forecasting energy price at different hours. In this paper, three different single-hour models are used to forecast electricity price at off peak, plateau, and peak load. A 24-hour model is also used to forecast electricity price of all hours simultaneously. Analysis of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions suggests different models for each single hour model as well as the 24-hour model. The best models for off peak, plateau, and peak load are obtained to be ARIMA(1,1,1), ARIMA(2,1,1) and ARIMA(0,1,1), respectively. In addition, the time-series analyses result in an AR(2) model with 24-hour period for the 24-hour model as the most suitable model. The models are compared from viewpoints of accuracy and time consuming. The comparison shows that the user should compromise between accuracy and speed, when selecting singlehour or 24-hour models. ©2010 IEEE.",Autocorrelation; Electrical energy; Forecasting; Partial autocorrelation; Time series,Best model; Electrical energy; Electricity prices; Energy prices; Partial autocorrelation; Partial autocorrelation function; Peak load; Power markets; Time variations; Adaptive filtering; Autocorrelation; Costs; Harmonic analysis; Regression analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper

"Jónsson T., Pinson P., Madsen H.",Day-ahead electricity prices in Denmark: The impact fo wind power forecasts,2009,1.0,"An analysis of how day-ahead electricity spot prices are affected by day-ahead wind power forecasts is presented. Demonstration of this relationship is given as a test case for the Western Danish price area of the Nord Pool's Elspot market. Impact on the average price behavior is investigated as well as that on the distributional properties of the price. By using a non-parametric regression model to assess the effects of wind power forecasts on the average behavior, the non-linearities and time variations in the relationship are captured well and the effects are shown to be quite substantial. Furthermore, by evaluating the distributional properties of the spot prices under different scenarios, the impact of the wind power forecasts on the price distribution is proven to be considerable. The conditional price distribution is moreover shown to be non-Gaussian. This implies that forecasting models for electricity spot prices for which parameters are estimated by a least squares techniques will not have Gaussian residuals. Hence the widespread assumption of Gaussian residuals from electricity spot price models is shown to be inadequate for these model types.

Wavelet transformed data is fed into neural network as pre-processing stage in order to get a better price pattern that will be reliable for forecasting. The historical LMP and corresponding load demand and temperature are trained, validated and tested over a period of one season. The efficient generalization of proposed model is investigated using early stopping technique. The results were compared with neural models using conventional back-propagation (BP) algorithm and radial basis function (RBF) and yielded encouraging results. © 2008 IEEE.",Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Predicted hourly LMP; Wavelet transform,Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Data processing; Deregulation; Electric fault location; Electric load forecasting; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Image classification; Lightning; Marketing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; Technology; Vegetation; Artificial neural networks; Competitive markets; Computational intelligence; Early stopping; Electrical and computer engineering; Error functions; Load demand; Locational marginal pricing; Neural modeling; Optimal search; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Particle swarm optimization algorithms; Power markets; Pre-processing; Predicted hourly LMP; Radial-basis function; Wavelet transform; Wavelet transformed data; Neural networks,Conference Paper
Wu Z.Q.,Reliability transaction and pricing under power system deregulation,2008,1.0,"Under deregulation, different customers require different levels of reliability; different generator units have different reliability. How to price the reliability in electricity market is one of the most important tasks for power system reliability analysis. In this paper, relation between backup capacity and supply reliability is established based on load forecasting probability density function. The reliability charging rates for customer load with different reliability requirements are determined by using back up reserve cost. Under reliability market, load customers bid the reliability requirement and price to the power transaction center (PX) according to their own reliability demands and the published reliability costs. The reserve schedule is determined according to customer reliability requirements and back up reserve market price. The PX calculates the required added back up reserve capacity caused by generation unit outage, and further the reliability charging rates for generation unit is determined. Load point reliability can be maintained by controlling the load curtailment when system load is greater than the total capacity of scheduled generators and back up units in real time operation. The proposed method can be used to price the customer reliability and generator unit reliability. It can also be used to determine system back up capacity requirement. System analysis is presented and the simulation results are very encouraging. © 2008 DRPT.",Back up reserve; Power market; Reliability pricing; Reliability transaction,Customer satisfaction; Deregulation; Electric load forecasting; Electric network analysis; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Industrial economics; Power generation; Power transmission; Probability density function; Quality assurance; Reliability; Risk assessment; Sales; Technology; Back up; Back up reserve; Backup capacity; Capacity requirements; Charging rates; Electricity markets; Generator units; International conferences; Load curtailment; Load forecasting; Load point reliability; Power market; Power system deregulation; Power system reliability; Power technologies; Probability densities; Real-time operations; Reliability costs; Reliability pricing; Reliability requirements; Reliability transaction; Reserve capacity; Reserve markets; Simulation results; Supply reliability; System analysis; System loads; Reliability analysis,Conference Paper

"Mirbach T., Blaesig B., Baltes P., Haubrich H.-J.",A competitive market simulation method for the investigation of the price development in the European market for electrical energy,2008,1.0,"Due to the liberalization of the European electricity market, power generation companies are exposed to national and international competition. Therefore, the behavior of the companies, which originally minimized their power generation costs, has changed to an individual profit maximization. In addition, political conditions, e.g. the implementation of emission certificates, have introduced new uncertainties for power generation companies resulting in new properties of the market price for electrical energy. In consequence, the economic profitability of generation units is influenced. Therefore, investigations and forecasts of the price development in the European power market have to consider these new conditions. Market simulation methods, which simulate the market for electrical energy, allow to investigate the development of the market price. Considering these circumstances, this paper presents a competitive market simulation method for the investigation of the price development in the central European market for electrical energy. The models of the market simulation take into account the technical constraints of power generation and transmission as well as the impact of profit maximization by power generation companies that influence the market price.

Nishikawa H.,Time series analysis of JEPX spot price with the box-Jenkins method,2007,1.0,"Following the examples of other countries, in April 2005 Japan launched wholesale electric power exchange operations as a primary item of system reform in line with electric liberalization. Only two years have passed since the initiation of these operations. However, in the summer of 2005, the surge in market prices was evident, which suggested that certain measures should be taken to confront potential market risks. Establishing a useful system for forecasting market prices through the modeling of price fluctuations in the wholesale electric market became essential. Currently, various price models are being proposed. Taking both the limited amount of data and the model's purpose into consideration, this study adopted the univariate time series model. We conducted a time series analysis on the open price indexes in the JEPX spot market with the Box-Jenkins method. Since a seven-day cycle can be observed in the data, we adopted the seasonal ARIMA model. In accordance with the procedures of the Box-Jenkins method, we determined the degree of the model's polynomial using the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation of the data and estimated the parameters of the model with the maximum likelihood method. We conducted a forecast on next day JEPX spot market prices with this time series model and examined its validity and utility as a forecasting tool. Price forecasts made with this model require only a small amount of data and will save substantial analysis work. Consequently, this method is expected to be widely used by market participants as the reference data for their bid pricing.",Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX); Market risk; Seasonal ARIMA model; Spot market; Time series analysis,Data acquisition; Electric power transmission; Marketing; Parameter estimation; Polynomial approximation; Time series analysis; Box-Jenkins method; Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX); Market risk; Cost accounting,Conference Paper

Many electric power markets are operated in many deregulated areas. We have already investigated the electric power prices of the day-ahead markets by the regression equations, such as California, PJM, NEMMCO, and so on. The simple regression equations are composed in our analysis, of which the dependent variable is the power price and the explanatory variables are the power demand and the power price of 24 hours ago. To improve the decision factor of the regression equations, we use the meteorological parameter as the new explanatory variables. The new regression equations are applied to the price data of New England market. Furthermore, because the decision factors are not good especially in the winter seasons, we introduce a ""cold temperature"" as the new explanatory variables.

"Mandal P., Senjyu T., Urasaki N., Funabashi T.",Electricity price and load short-term forecasting using artificial neural networks,2006,1.0,"This paper presents an approach for short-term electricity price and load forecasting using the artificial neural network (ANN) computing technique. The described approach uses the three-layered ANN paradigm with back-propagation. The publicly available data, acquired from the deregulated Victorian power system, was used for training and testing the ANN. The ANN approach based on similarity technique has been proposed according to which the load and price curves are forecasted by using the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. A Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of similar days. Two different ANN models, one for load forecasting and another for price forecasting, have been proposed. Test results show that average price and load MAPEs for the year 2003 by using the ANN approach are obtained as 14.29% and 0.95%, respectively. MAPE values obtained from the price and load fore-casting results confirm considerable value of the ANN based approach in forecasting short-term electricity prices and loads.

A set of conflicting decisions by independent generators that each of them tries to maximize its profit will shape this complex process. Because of these conflicts the whole process must be managed and conducted by regulatory body to prevent instability in the long-term electricity market.

The SMP forecasting is a very important element in an electricity market for the optimal biddings of market participants as well as for market stabilization of regulatory bodies. Input data are organized in two different approaches, time-axis and day-axis approaches, and the resulting patterns are used to train the ANN. Performances of the two approaches are compared and the better estimate is selected by a composition rule to forecast the SMP. By combining the two approaches, the proposed composition technique reflects the characteristics of hourly, daily and seasonal variations, as well as the condition of sudden changes in the spot market, and thus improves the accuracy of forecasting. The proposed method is applied to the historical real-world data from the Korea Power Exchange (KPX) to verify the effectiveness of the technique.

"Yang H., Lai M.",Chaotic characteristics of electricity price and its forecasting model,2005,1.0,"In electricity market the price of electricity depends on the joint effect of many factors with its evolving process characterized by very complicated random motion. To reveal the inherent law behind the seemingly random evolving process, first the chaotic feature of electricity price is verified with the chaos theory. The Lyapunov exponents and the fractal dimensions of the attractors are extracted from the phase space reconstructed by the single variable time series of electricity price. Here it can be seen that the electricity price possesses chaotic characteristics, and such a chaotic behavior is further verified by the surrogate data method, providing the basis for performing the short-term forecast of electricity price with the help of the chaos theory. Then a more accurate phase space is reconstructed by the multi-variable time series constituted by the electricity price and its correlated factors, i.e., the system load and the available generating capacity time series. By tracing the evolving trend of the adjacent phase points in the phase space, the global and local electricity price forecasting models based on the recurrent neural network are established, with which the electricity prices in the New England electricity market are successfully predicted. © Institution of Engineers, Australia 2005.",,Chaos theory; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Multivariable systems; Phase control; Random processes; Time series analysis; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Forecasting models; Random motions; Electricity,Conference Paper

This study briefly discusses the deregulation of the Singapore electricity sector before employing a log-linear form for estimating the coefficient of price-quantity relationships in the electricity demand. Two-stage least squares regression method is used and the estimation would yield the elasticity of demand. The more elastic is the demand, the more consumption efficient is the New Electricity Market. This is because consumers who are allowed to choose their retailers or purchase electricity on their own behalf will be able to choose the best package and also to make more efforts to respond to price fluctuations. The analysis reveals that the market would bring about some consumption-efficiency gains.

Recently, the deregulation in power industries has impacted on the power system operational problems. The energy market bidding strategies among market participants are highly dependent on the short-term price. Therefore, short-term SMP forecasting is a very important issue to market participants to maximize their profits, and to market operator who may wish to operate the electricity market in a stable sense. The proposed neural network based forecasting scheme is composed of three layers. In this process, firstly input data are appropriately set up to reflect market conditions. And secondly A, the coefficient of activation function is suitably adjusted in order to give a proper signal to a neuron considering the inversion of output neuron's signal.

"Kuosmanen T., Zhou X.",Shadow prices and marginal abatement costs: Convex quantile regression approach,2021,,"Marginal abatement cost (MAC) is a critically important concept for efficient environmental policy and management. In this paper we argue that most empirical studies using frontier estimation methods such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) over-estimate MACs. The first methodological contribution of this paper is to clarify the conceptual distinction between the shadow price and MAC in order to analyze three sources of upward bias due to the limited set of abatement options, inefficiency, and noisy data. Our second methodological contribution is to develop a novel MAC estimation approach based on convex quantile regression. Compared to the traditional methods, convex quantile regression is more robust to the choice of the direction vector, random noise, and heteroscedasticity. Empirical application to the U.S. electric power plants demonstrates that the upward bias of DEA may be a serious problem in real-world applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Data envelopment analysis; Environmental performance; Nonparametric regression; Production theory; Undesirable outputs,Data envelopment analysis; Electric power plants; Electric power systems; Environmental protection; Empirical studies; Environmental policy; Estimation approaches; Frontier estimation; Heteroscedasticity; Marginal abatement costs; Methodological contributions; Quantile regression; Costs,Article
"Piao L., de Vries L., de Weerdt M., Yorke-Smith N.",Electricity markets for DC distribution systems: Locational pricing trumps wholesale pricing,2021,,"DC distribution systems are a promising alternative to existing AC distribution systems. They connect customers to local energy sources without conversion, thus reducing power losses. However, the unique features of DC impose strict requirements for system operation compared to AC. Within the context of a liberalized energy market, this article demonstrates three promising market designs—an outcome of a comprehensive engineering design framework—that meet those DC requirements. They are an integrated market design, which incorporates all system costs into energy prices; a market design that passes wholesale energy prices directly to prosumers; and a locational energy market design that relieves congestion with nodal prices. An optimization model estimates the three market designs’ performance by simulating a realistic DC distribution system, featuring a high share of electric vehicles. Results indicate that the integrated market design is optimal in theory but computationally infeasible in practice. The wholesale energy price design aiming at constraint-free energy trading requires substantial investments in flexibility. The locational energy market design yields nearly optimal operation in urban networks and is considered the best feasible market design for DC distribution systems. © 2020 The Author(s)",Direct current; Distribution system; Electricity market design; Flexibility; Optimization,DC power transmission; Free energy; Investments; Location; Power markets; DC distribution system; Energy market designs; Engineering design; Liberalized energy markets; Locational pricing; Optimal operation; Optimization modeling; Substantial investments; Costs; electric vehicle; electricity industry; energy market; energy planning; feasibility study; optimization; price determination; price dynamics,Article

It investigates the California electricity market (zone SP15) for selected trading hours using data from January 8, 2013 to September 24, 2016. The approach quantifies a non-linear relationship between the fundamentals and electricity prices, just as predicted by the merit order curve. Natural gas, greenhouse gas allowance prices and load all have a positive effect on electricity prices, with the effect increasing with the quantiles. In contrast, solar production and wind production both have a negative effect on electricity prices. The effect of solar production increases with quantiles, whereas the effect of wind production decreases with quantiles. This paper also includes a stress testing case study in which a producer faces the risk of high solar and wind production, and investigates the effect on the lower tail of the price distribution.

"Brok N.B., Munk-Nielsen T., Madsen H., Stentoft P.A.",Unlocking energy flexibility of municipal wastewater aeration using predictive control to exploit price differences in power markets,2020,,"To accommodate the increasing amount of renewable energy sources in electricity grids it is crucial to utilize the flexibility of all electricity consumers. Municipal wastewater treatment plants consume approximately 1 % of the electricity consumption of a country's total electricity consumption, to reduce nutrient concentrations from the incoming wastewater before discharging the water back into the environment. In this paper, a novel economic optimal control strategy is proposed for unlocking the available energy flexibility in wastewater treatment. The strategy suggests that the power consumption in wastewater treatment can be flexible since the water is treated in large tanks with long retention times where specialized aeration equipment is repeatedly switched on and off. By controlling these switching times with respect to nutrient concentrations, electricity consumption can be predicted and shifted in time and hence provide short-term demand side flexibility. The proposed principle is used to reduce the operating costs of a wastewater treatment plant by enabling the flexibility to distribute the aeration load to periods with less expensive power prices. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated for the operation of a single wastewater treatment plant and the strategy is backtested on Nord Pool market data from 2019. This shows modest savings of 1.15% if only the day-ahead market is considered. However, if the regulating and special regulating power prices are included in the optimization the realized savings are in the magnitude of 7.23% and 27.32%, respectively. Thus this study is considered as a step towards exploiting flexibility for the benefit of reducing the combined taxation and aeration cost of wastewarer treatment. © 2020",Balancing market; Energy flexibility; Optimal control; Optimization; Price-based control; Smart energy application; Wastewater treatment,Cost reduction; Electric power utilization; Nutrients; Operating costs; Optimal control systems; Power markets; Reclamation; Renewable energy resources; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Taxation; Water aeration; Water treatment plants; Electricity consumers; Electricity-consumption; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Municipal wastewaters; Nutrient concentrations; Optimal control strategy; Renewable energy source; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; aeration; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy planning; municipal solid waste; optimization; power plant; prediction; wastewater treatment,Article
Jasiński T.,Use of new variables based on air temperature for forecasting day-ahead spot electricity prices using deep neural networks: A new approach,2020,,"The paper presents a way of creating three new, innovative variables based on air temperature to be used in forecasts of electricity demand and prices. The forecasting methods developed so far, especially in the area of energy prices, either did not use temperature data or were based on data that had not undergone pre-processing, which made it difficult for the model to use their potential. Newly developed variables have a linear relationship with the demand for electricity. This paper describes in detail the procedure for determining the parameters of new variables using the electricity market in Poland (a country in Central Europe) as a case study. The proposed approach allows both to avoid data clustering into different seasons and to precisely determine the temperatures at which the nature of the dependence with the demand for electricity changes. The validity of the proposed new variables in prognostic models has been confirmed by their use in deep neural networks. The proposed approach allows reducing the sMAPE by up to 15.3%. The designed new explanatory variables can be used not only in models based on artificial intelligence tools, but also in other forecasting methods that allow the use of exogenous inputs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Air temperature-based variable; Artificial neural network; Electricity price; Forecasting,Atmospheric temperature; Clustering algorithms; Costs; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Neural networks; Artificial intelligence tools; Electricity demands; Explanatory variables; Forecasting methods; Linear relationships; Prognostic model; Spot electricity prices; Temperature data; Power markets; air temperature; artificial neural network; computer simulation; demand-side management; electricity supply; energy planning; forecasting method; price determination; Poland [Central Europe],Article
"Narajewski M., Ziel F.",Ensemble forecasting for intraday electricity prices: Simulating trajectories,2020,,"Recent studies concerning the point electricity price forecasting have shown evidence that the hourly German Intraday Continuous Market is weak-form efficient. Therefore, we take a novel, advanced approach to the problem. A probabilistic forecasting of the hourly intraday electricity prices is performed by simulating trajectories in every trading window to receive a realistic ensemble to allow for more efficient intraday trading and redispatch. A generalized additive model is fitted to the price differences with the assumption that they follow a zero-inflated distribution, precisely a mixture of the Dirac and the Student's t-distributions. Moreover, the mixing term is estimated using a high-dimensional logistic regression with lasso penalty. We model the expected value and volatility of the series using i.a. autoregressive and no-trade effects or load, wind and solar generation forecasts and accounting for the non-linearities in e.g. time to maturity. Both the in-sample characteristics and forecasting performance are analysed using a rolling window forecasting study. Multiple versions of the model are compared to several benchmark models and evaluated using probabilistic forecasting measures and significance tests. The study aims to forecast the price distribution in the German Intraday Continuous Market in the last 3 h of trading, but the approach allows for application to other continuous markets, especially in Europe. The results prove superiority of the mixture model over the benchmarks gaining the most from the modelling of the volatility. They also indicate that the introduction of XBID reduced the market volatility. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Continuous-trade markets; Electricity price forecasting; Ensemble forecasting; Generalized additive models; Intraday market; Lasso; Logistic regression; Power markets; Probabilistic forecasting; Scenario simulation; Short-term forecasting; Trajectories; XBID; Zero-inflated distribution,Commerce; Costs; Logistic regression; Mixtures; Solar power generation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Ensemble forecasting; Forecasting performance; Generalized additive model; Market volatility; Probabilistic forecasting; Student's t distribution; Forecasting; electricity; ensemble forecasting; market conditions; performance assessment; price determination; simulation; Europe,Article

Therefore, the present study is an effort to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by recruiting political institutions and energy prices to examine financial development with the most comprehensive (IMF's index) in BRIC (Brazil, Russia, China, and India) in a framework of resource endowment theory. By using the maximum data available from 1992 to 2016, short- & long-run relationships are estimated through cross-section augmented autoregressive distributive lag model (CS-ARDL) along with a common correlated effect mean group (CCEMG). As per the results of the above-mentioned second-generation econometric techniques, political-institutional quality is positively effecting financial development, implying better quality of institutions is strengthening financial development. Whereas, energy prices are negatively effecting financial development. Moreover, the resources are found as a blessing for BRIC economies.

An analysis of Texas’s wholesale electricity market,2020,,"Using data from Texas’s wholesale electricity market, we investigate the relationship between nodal prices and investment location decisions of utility-scale generation. We find some evidence that new investment arises in areas with recently elevated nodal prices. However, we find no evidence that new generation resources receive a nodal price premium post-entry as projected by the expectation of higher nodal prices. Further, a logit regression analysis suggests that the probability of natural-gas-fired generation investments tends to increase with expected nodal prices in peak hours. However, the estimated relationship is statistically and economically weak and sensitive to model specification. These findings suggest other factors are more important drivers than nodal prices of location decisions for utility-scale generation investments in Texas. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Electricity; Entry; Locational marginal pricing; Regulation,,Article

"Lisi F., Shah I.",Forecasting next-day electricity demand and prices based on functional models,2020,,"Efficient modeling and forecasting of electricity demand and prices is an important issue in competitive electricity markets. This work investigates the forecasting performance of several models for the 1-day-ahead prediction of demand and prices on four electricity markets (APX Power-UK, Nord Pool, PJM and IPEX). All the models are based on two steps: a nonparametric estimation of some deterministic components, followed by the choice of a suitable model for the residual stochastic component. This latter step includes univariate and multivariate as well as parametric and nonparametric models, with particular emphasis on the functional approach, that models the whole daily profile as a single functional observation. More specifically, the models involved are: a linear model and a nonlinear (nonparametric) autoregressive model, a vector autoregressive model and four autoregressive functional specifications. Prediction covers a whole year. Comparisons are based both on descriptive statistics and on statistical tests of equal forecasting accuracy. Though results partly depend on specific markets, a double functional model always proved to be the best- or no different from the best-model, highlighting the effectiveness of the functional approach. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","APX, NP, IPEX, PJM; Electricity demand forecasting; Electricity prices forecasting; Functional models; Nonparametric models","Commerce; Costs; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; APX, NP, IPEX, PJM; Electricity demand forecasting; Electricity prices forecasting; Functional model; Non-parametric model; Power markets",Article
"De Marcos R.A., Bunn D.W., Bello A., Reneses J.",Short-term electricity price forecasting with recurrent regimes and structural breaks,2020,,"This paper develops a new approach to short-term electricity forecasting by focusing upon the dynamic specification of an appropriate calibration dataset prior to model specification.

The approach in this paper recognises that the most relevant dataset in the episodic, recurrent nature of electricity dynamics may not be the most recent. This methodology provides a dynamic calibration dataset approach that is based on cluster analysis applied to fundamental market regime indicators, as well as structural time series breakpoint analyses. Forecasting is based upon applying a hybrid fundamental optimisation model with a neural network to the appropriate calibration data. The results outperform other benchmark models in backtesting on data from the Iberian electricity market of 2017, which presents a considerable number of market structural breaks and evolving market price drivers. © 2020 by the authors.",Day-ahead electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Fundamental-econometric models; Market structural breaks,Calibration; Cluster analysis; Forecasting; Recurrent neural networks; Specifications; Time series analysis; Breakpoint analysis; Dynamic calibration; Dynamic specifications; Electricity price forecasting; Iberian electricity market; Model specifications; Model transition; Optimisation models; Power markets,Article
"Lucas A., Pegios K., Kotsakis E., Clarke D.",Price forecasting for the balancing energy market using machine-learning regression,2020,,"The importance of price forecasting has gained attention over the last few years, with the growth of aggregators and the general opening of the European electricity markets. Market participants manage a tradeoff between, bidding in a lower price market (day-ahead), but with typically higher volume, or aiming for a lower volume market but with potentially higher returns (balance energy market). Companies try to forecast the extremes of revenues or prices, in order to manage risk and opportunity, assigning their assets in an optimal way. It is thought that in general, electricity markets have quasi-deterministic principles, rather than being based on speculation, hence the desire to forecast the price based on variables that can describe the outcome of the market. Many studies address this problem from a statistical approach or by performing multiple-variable regressions, but they very often focus only on the time series analysis. In 2019, the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) was made available in the UK for the first time. Taking this opportunity, this study focusses on five LOLP variables (with different time-ahead estimations) and other quasi-deterministic variables, to explain the price behavior of a multi-variable regression model. These include base production, system load, solar and wind generation, seasonality, day-ahead price and imbalance volume contributions. Three machine-learning algorithms were applied to test for performance, Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost. XGBoost presented higher performance and so it was chosen for the implementation of the real time forecast step. The model returns a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.89 £/MWh, a coefficient of determination (R2 score) of 76.8% and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 124.74. The variables that contribute the most to the model are the Net Imbalance Volume, the LOLP (aggregated), the month and the De-rated margins (aggregated) with 28.6%, 27.5%, 14.0%, and 8.9% of weight on feature importance respectively. © 2020 by the authors.",Balance energy market; Demand response; Imbalance market; Loss of load probability; Machine learning; Price forecast,Adaptive boosting; Balancing; Decision trees; Fintech; Forecasting; Loss of load probability; Machine learning; Mean square error; Multivariable systems; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Gradient boosting; Loss of load probabilities (LOLP); Market participants; Mean absolute error; Mean squared error; Real-time forecasts; Risk and opportunity; Statistical approach; Power markets,Article
"Yan G., Trück S.",A dynamic network analysis of spot electricity prices in the Australian national electricity market,2020,,"This study applies dynamic network analysis to the power sector, examining the relationship between regional spot electricity prices in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). In particular, we employ principal component analysis and generate Granger causality networks to examine the degree of interconnectedness of the NEM in a time-varying setting. We find that the derived measures of interdependence can be related to actual market events such as price spikes, unexpected high demand for electricity, sudden increases in price volatility, rebidding of dominant generators, the temporary or permanent outage of major power stations, and upgrades and limitations in transmission capacity. In the analysed network, we find that stronger dependence is exhibited by regional markets that are linked through interconnectors, while the direction of Granger causality can be related to interregional trade. We further examine the usefulness of the derived measures for forecasting distributional characteristics of spot prices such as the maximum price, volatility, price spreads, or upcoming periods of price spikes. Our results suggest that the derived network measures have predictive power, albeit limited, for the behaviour of spot electricity prices in the NEM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Dependence and interconnectedness; Dynamic networks; Electricity markets; Multivariate analysis; Risk management; Spot prices,Electric industry; Power markets; Statistical tests; Dynamic network analysis; Granger Causality; National electricity markets; Network measures; Price volatility; Regional markets; Spot electricity prices; Transmission capacities; Costs; electricity supply; energy market; multivariate analysis; price dynamics; risk assessment; Australia,Article
Ghasemi-Marzbali A.,"A developed short-term electricity price and load forecasting method based on data processing, support vector machine, and virus colony search",2020,,"Surely, electricity market participants need an accurate estimate for the price and load signals to properly manage their programs to increase their profits. Regarding the two-way interaction between suppliers and consumers, they are able to manage their required profile. Therefore, the individual price or load forecasting is not acceptable and cannot capture their related pattern. Therefore, this paper presents a new forecasting method for price and load signals in simultaneous configuration. This method consists of three main parts: the first part proposes two data preprocessing methods based on wavelet transform to remove noisy term and mutual information to select best features with maximum relevancy and minimum redundancy. The second part suggests a learning engine based on a least square support vector machine (LSSVM) with self-adaptive kernel functions and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) time series to extract the linear and nonlinear patterns. Finally, the last part employs a new modified virus colony search algorithm (VCS) to efficiently set the LSSVM control parameters to use its all capacity. Simulations are carried out for three well-known Australia’s, New York’s, and Ontario’s electricity markets. The obtained results show the acceptable results. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Feature selection; Optimization; Price/load forecast; Smart grid; Support vector machine; Wavelet transform,Data handling; Electric power plant loads; Forecasting; Learning systems; Power markets; Support vector machines; Viruses; Wavelet transforms; Adaptive kernel functions; Data preprocessing; Forecasting methods; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity; Least square support vector machines; Market participants; Mutual informations; Two-way interaction; Electric load forecasting; algorithm; data processing; electricity supply; forecasting method; optimization; pattern recognition; price determination; smart grid; support vector machine; transform,Article
"Zhang Y., Deng C., Zhao R., leto S.",A novel integrated price and load forecasting method in smart grid environment based on multi-level structure,2020,,"Prediction of load and price are two critical key in power system planning and operation. Most of the recent works in this area forecast the load and price signals separately but, a dynamic model in smart grid is evaluated while, the customers may have opportunity to react the proposed prices changing through shifting the electricity usages from expensive to cheaper hours. So, the load and price signals are coupled strongly which made the previous prediction models ineffective. In this research, a synthetic prediction approach has been proposed by considering the load and price signals, simultaneously. This method works as multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model based on least square support vector machine (LSSVM) forecast engine. Furthermore, a dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) is suggested in this approach to decompose the original signal into different small sub-signals. Beside of that, the modified mutual information (MMI) filter has been used to choose the best candidate input of forecast engine. The learning section is also coupled with novel modified optimization algorithm based on gravitational search algorithm (GSA) which called as modified GSA (MGSA). Finally, various forecasting errors have been considered as average mean absolute percentage error and error variance to get the comparison outcomes and performance of forecasting approaches. For this purpose, different markets have been considered as test case to show the efficiency of suggested approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",DWT; Feature selection; Load and price prediction; LSSVM; MIMO model; Smart grids,Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission networks; Engines; Errors; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; MIMO systems; Predictive analytics; Signal processing; Smart power grids; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Dyadic wavelet transform; Gravitational search algorithm (GSA); Least square support vector machines; Mean absolute percentage error; Multi-input-multi-output models; Optimization algorithms; Power system planning and operation; Price and load forecasting; Electric load forecasting,Article

In this paper, a new bidding strategy model has been presented based on the Genetic Algorithm and a refined Monte Carlo simulation model. This process is done through the similarity function and consideration of the seasonality trend as the main characteristic of the electricity spot price. The main contributions of this paper include: (a): Consideration of the similarity value for all days in historical dates in the database, (b): Consideration of the seasonality trend of market clearing price by applying K-Means algorithm for clustering historical data based on demand, (c): Application of the proposed model for each cluster's data, (d): Performance evaluation of the fitness function of each generated strategy by a simulation model based on historical data. The proposed model has been tested for the 10 subsets of Iran's electricity market 2016.

"Fu T., Zhang S., Wang C.",Application and research for electricity price forecasting system based on multi-objective optimization and sub-models selection strategy,2020,,"In general, electricity prices reflect the cost to build, finance, maintain, and operate power plants and the electricity grid. Therefore, the cost-optimized scheduling of industrial loads with accurate price forecasts is very important. As such, recent studies have attempted to combine models to forecast electricity prices more accurately. Earlier combined models have tended to ignore the selection of sub-models and data analyses, leading to poor forecasting performance. In order to select the best forecasting models in a combined model, we propose a hybrid electricity price forecasting system that includes a data analysis module, a sub-model selection strategy module, optimized forecasting processing, and a model evaluation module. As such, the hybrid system fully exploits the advantages of a single model, thus improving the forecasting performance of the combined model. The experimental results show that the proposed system selects optimal sub-models effectively and successfully identifies future trend changes in the electricity price. Thus, the system can be an effective tool in the planning and implementation of smart grids. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Combined model; Electricity prices; Hybrid forecasting system; Sub-models selection strategy,Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Multiobjective optimization; Power plants; Electricity grids; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting models; Forecasting performance; Industrial loads; Model evaluation; Price forecasts; Power markets,Article

This research aims to discuss the following two points in the forecasting task: an explicit scheme for estimating high and low-price situations and an effective weighted integration of given multiple forecast products depending on the estimated situations. The authors propose an adaptive method of combining market price forecasts (ADAPTIVE) to utilize several types of given forecast results efficiently and improve forecasting accuracy. The method aims to capture the features of the component models' results considering high- and low-prices situations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ADAPTIVE, numerical experiments were conducted on electricity spot market prices in the Japan Electric Power Exchange.

"Visser L., Alskaif T., Van Sark W.",The importance of predictor variables and feature selection in day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2020,,"Electricity spot market prices are increasingly affected by an expanding amount of renewables and a growing number of market participants. In an attempt to improve forecasting accuracy, this paper evaluates the importance of 62 predictor variables to forecast the the day-ahead electricity price. These variables describe the electricity price, load, generation and weather at different times in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. In this study we assess the performance of four machine learning models that forecast the electricity price. Next, we rank the variables according to their importance and identify to what extent different estimators and feature selection methods affect the performance of the forecasting models. We found that Random Forest regression is the best performing model regardless of the number of features selected and the feature selection method applied. Secondly, the performance of all models was not found to improve significantly after the selection of the top 15 ranked variables. Interestingly the top ranked variables differ significantly per selection method. Moreover, the feature selection methods based on Multi-variate Linear Regression and linear kernel Support Vector Machine were found to give the best performance for all models. © 2020 IEEE.",Electricity price; Feature ranking; Feature selection; Forecasting; Machine learning; Spot market,Decision trees; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot market; Feature selection methods; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting models; Machine learning models; Market participants; Predictor variables; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Fang X., Cui M.",Analytical model of day-ahead and real-time price correlation in strategic wind power offering,2020,,"In this paper, the model of strategic wind power offering in the day-ahead (DA) market is proposed considering the uncertainties of wind power production, and price forecasting of DA and real-time (RT) market. The wind power deviation in the RT market is settled with the two-price mechanism based on the deviation direction and the relation between the locational marginal prices (LMPs) of DA and RT. Instead of using the point forecasting for the DA and RT LMPs, the uncertainties of LMP forecasting are modeled. In addition, the correlation between the forecasting errors of DA and RT LMP are directly modeled instead of generating the correlated scenarios. Finally, the opitmal offered quantity of wind power in the DA market is derived using the probability theory based on the probabilistic wind power forecasting. The case study using the price data of actual DA and RT from Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) validates the effectiveness of the proposed model. It shows that the correlation of the forecasting errors of DA and RT LMP has a significant impact on the wind power quantity offered by DA and revenue results. © 2020, Springer.

We tailor a recently introduced econometric model with fundamental impacts, which is successful in describing the pricing of day contracts. Our estimation results show that the mean reversion and the positive price impact of neighboring contracts are generic features of the price formation process on the intraday market, independent of the time of day. Intraday auction prices have higher explanatory power for the pricing of night than day contracts, particularly, for the first and last 15-min. contract in a night hour. Intradaily updated forecasts of wind power infeed are the only significant fundamental factors for intraday electricity prices at night. Neither expected conventional capacities nor the slope of the merit order curve contribute to explaining price dynamics. Overall, we conclude that fundamentals lose in importance in night hours and the 15-min. intraday market is rather driven by price information. © 2020 by the authors.",15-min. contracts; Econometric modeling; Fundamentals; Intraday electricity market; Night contracts; Renewable power forecasts,Power markets; Wind power; Econometric model; Electricity prices; Electricity pricing; Estimation results; Explanatory power; Generic features; Price formation; Price information; Costs,Article

This requires accurate production forecasting. The main aim of this study is to comparatively examine the wind generation forecasts in Poland and Portugal, as well as to verify their influence on the day-ahead market prices. The statistical analysis revealed significant deviations of the forecasted and actual wind production in both countries, which referred to the corresponding spot and balancing prices caused considerable financial losses by the wind energy suppliers. In this paper, the influence of the wind generation forecasts on the spot prices has been examined through developed the auto-regressive moving average (ARMA), ARMA with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) and non-linear auto-regressive neural network (NAR), NAR with exogenous inputs (NARX)artificial neural network (ANN) models. The results have shown that the usability of the information of forecasted wind generation is not unequivocal in models developed for spot prices in Poland, mainly because of the randomness and volatility of recorded wind generation forecasts. However, in the case of Portugal, the forecasted wind generation occurred to be a valuable input in spot prices models, which results in an improvement in the models’ accuracy. © 2020 by the authors.

"Christensen T.S., Benth F.E.",Modelling the joint behaviour of electricity prices in interconnected markets,2020,,"The liberalization of energy markets worldwide during recent decades has introduced severe implications for the price formation in these markets. Especially within the European day-ahead electricity markets, increased physical connections between different market areas and a joint effort on optimizing the aggregate social welfare have led to highly connected markets. Consequently, observing the exact same hourly day-ahead prices for two or more interconnected electricity markets in Europe happens frequently. This affects the modelling of such prices and in turn the valuation of derivatives written on prices from these market areas. In this paper, we propose a joint model for day-ahead electricity prices in interconnected markets composed of a combination of transformed Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes. We discuss the properties of the model and propose an estimation procedure based on filtering techniques. Furthermore, the properties of the model reveal that analytical prices are attainable for, e.g., forwards and spread options. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Day-ahead electricity prices; Derivative pricing; Interconnected markets; Stochastic modelling,,Article

"MacIejowska K., Uniejewski B., Serafin T.",PCA forecast averaging - Predicting day-ahead and intraday electricity prices,2020,,"Recently, the development in combining point forecasts of electricity prices obtained with different length of calibration windows have provided an extremely efficient and simple tool for improving predictive accuracy. However, the proposed methods are strongly dependent on expert knowledge and may not be directly transferred from one to another model or market. Hence, we consider a novel extension and propose to use principal component analysis (PCA) to automate the procedure of averaging over a rich pool of predictions. We apply PCA to a panel of over 650 point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows length. The robustness of the approach is evaluated with three different forecasting tasks, i.e., forecasting day-ahead prices, forecasting intraday ID3 prices one day in advance, and finally very short term forecasting of ID3 prices (i.e., six hours before delivery). The empirical results are compared using the Mean Absolute Error measure and Giacomini and White test for conditional predictive ability (CPA).

"Gulay E., Duru O.",Hybrid modeling in the predictive analytics of energy systems and prices,2020,,"The aim of this paper is to illustrate the nature of the residuals of a forecasting process and to propose a hybrid approach with linear and nonlinear components predicted by corresponding methodologies. It is a common practice that residuals are assumed to be unpredictable or are reiterated into a model as lagged variables to capture any information remaining in the residual data. The central argument of this paper is that residuals from energy price forecasting can still carry predictive information in its complex and nonlinear form. Although the linear modeling is initially very accurate, reiterating residuals in linear structures is a mismatch of data type and methodology. In this regard, the proposed algorithm hybridizes or combines linear components captured by the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) and nonlinear components processed by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve post-sample accuracy. The conventional reiterative process can improve in-sample accuracy, which literally has no value for business forecasting practices.

"Wen S., Zhao T., Tang Y., Xu Y., Fang S., Zhu M., Ding Z.",Joint Energy Management and Voyage Scheduling for All-Electric Ships Using Dynamic Real-Time Electricity Price of Onshore Power,2020,,"Unlike a land-based standalone microgrid, the shipboard power system of an all-electric ship (AES) needs to shut down generators during berthing at the port for exanimation and maintenance. Therefore, the cost of shore power plays an important role in an economic operation for AESs. In order to fully exploit its potential, a two-stage joint scheduling model is proposed to optimally coordinate the voyage scheduling and power generation of an AES. Different from previous studies which only consider the operation cost of the ship itself, a novel coordinated framework is developed in this paper to address the uncertainty of the real-time electricity price of shore-side electricity to optimize the AES's navigation. A deep learning-based forecasting method is utilized to predict the electricity price of various places for ship operators. Then, a multi-stage hybrid optimization algorithm is designed to solve the proposed multi-objective joint scheduling problem.

As a result, electricity can be easily purchased and sold across further areas and countries. On the other hand, trying to guarantee renewable projects profitability, Power Purchase Agreements and Options contracts are arising as a feasible solution. The problem arises when the power plant owners have to negotiate the purchase electricity price in order to optimize risks and profits, as well as make future plans. Thus, several methods for Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) have been developed and presented, showing different results, as market spot prices suffer from strong seasonality, spikes and high volatility. In this paper, three methods, based on Deep Learning Dynamic Neural Networks (NAR, NARX and LSTM) applied to forecast MIBEL electricity spot prices are discussed in order to evaluate their adequacy, accuracy and reliable horizon. © 2020 IEEE.",Deep Learning Dynamic Neural Networks; Electricity Markets; Electricity Price Forecasting; LSTM; NAR; NARX; Time Series,Costs; Deep neural networks; Deregulation; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Power markets; Profitability; Sales; Dynamic neural networks; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Feasible solution; High volatility; Power purchase agreement; Renewable projects; Deep learning,Conference Paper

Marwan M.,The impact of probability of electricity price spike and outside temperature to define total expected cost for air conditioning,2020,,"The purpose of this paper is to address the problems experienced by customers in the utilisation of electrical energy for air conditioners (ACs). According to the proposed schema in this paper, the customer will be able to evaluate the impacts of a probable electricity price spike and the outside temperature (Tout) to calculate the total expected electricity cost for an AC (TEC). The aim of this paper is to show how consumers can estimate the TEC for any temperature. In this research, a model considering two types of price spikes (PS) is developed, namely: short-duration and long-duration spikes. To evaluate and examine this model, spike durations of half hour, one hour, and one and half hour were simulated to determine TEC. This proposed schema also examines how the control system applies a pre-cooling method if there is a substantial risk of PS. The results present possible savings on the electrical energy consumption when the consumer applies this method to anticipate spike events.

The analysis of the price data can provide plenty of the market information. It is helpful for the participants to understand the market and improve future strategies. However, most of the forecast models eliminate the details to reduce the structural risk for generality. In this paper, the data-driven analysis is proposed to explore the PJM electricity price in detail. The price time series is decomposed into different components. Each component is modeled and tested by the statistical method to illustrate the hidden pattern of the fluctuation, so that there can be reasonable interpretation about the market.

In this sense, there is an urgent need for all market participants to identify the pivotal aspects of electricity market price fluctuation effectively and anticipate its future trend. For certain applications such as DSM, considering the high volatility and nonlinear of real-time electricity price, we can approximate the interval prediction to achieve the multi-classification that relies on critical pattern recognition of entire category of the price sequence. Therefore, this paper presents a study on the utilization of a novel electricity price classification framework which consists of Bayesian extreme learning machine (BELM) model, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm, and multivariate sequence segmentation (MSS). Considering many advantages of deep learning structure in capturing the hierarchical and sophisticated characteristics of multidimensional sequence, the multi-layer BELM (ML-BELM) model is also extended and utilized to the modeling. To demonstrate the potential of the pattern classification framework, the proposed approaches are evaluated using hourly clearing price cases from Canada Ontario and New York electricity market. In particular, we investigate the performance of different classifiers regarding the 3 multi-classification and higher dimensional classification modes with respect to various scenarios in terms of precision, recall, AUC (Area Under roc Curve) score, and F1-measure indicators.

Due to the limited market activity of crop straws, this paper uses the contingent valuation method to elicit farmers' willingness-to-accept (WTA) price to sell their crop straws in northeast China. The results from finite mixed models showed that the estimated WTA for maize straw was 9.6 yuan/ton, 43.2 yuan/ton and 83.2 yuan/ton across different farm groups. For rice straw, the WTA for the first farm group was 51 yuan/ton and 204 yuan/ton for the second group.

"Naumzik C., Feuerriegel S.",Forecasting electricity prices with machine learning: predictor sensitivity,2020,,"Purpose: Trading on electricity markets occurs such that the price settlement takes place before delivery, often day-ahead. In practice, these prices are highly volatile as they largely depend upon a range of variables such as electricity demand and the feed-in from renewable energy sources. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to provide accurate forecasts. Design/methodology/approach: This paper aims at comparing different predictors stemming from supply-side (solar and wind power generation), demand-side, fuel-related and economic influences. For this reason, this paper implements a broad range of non-linear models from machine learning and draw upon the information-fusion-based sensitivity analysis. Findings: This study disentangles the respective relevance of each predictor. This study shows that external predictors altogether decrease root mean squared errors by up to 21.96%. A Diebold-Mariano test statistically proves that the forecasting accuracy of the proposed machine learning models is superior. Research limitations/implications: The performance gain from including more predictors might be larger than from a better model. Future research should place attention on expanding the data basis in electricity price forecasting. Practical implications: When developing pricing models, practitioners can achieve reasonable performance with a simple model (e.g. seasonal-autoregressive moving-average) that is built upon a wide range of predictors. Originality/value: The benefit of adding further predictors has only recently received traction; however, little is known about how the individual variables contribute to improving forecasts in machine learning. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Artificial intelligence; Electricity; Forecasting; Neural networks,Costs; Demand side management; Electric power generation; Forecasting; Machine learning; Mean square error; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Wind power; Autoregressive moving average; Design/methodology/approach; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Machine learning models; Renewable energy source; Root mean squared errors; Power markets,Article
"Huang C.-J., Shen Y., Chen Y.-H., Chen H.-C.",A novel hybrid deep neural network model for short-term electricity price forecasting,2020,,"A Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things is fundamentally an Internet of Things, but focused upon power systems. Being able to predict these prices accurately may help with the identification of customer needs and the effective regulation of the power grid by power producers. It may also help electric power traders to manage risks, make correct decisions, and obtain more benefits. In this paper, a novel hybrid model is proposed for short-term electricity price prediction. The model consists of three algorithms: Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD); a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). This is called SEPNet for convenience. The annual electricity price data is divided into seasons because of seasonal differences in the time series of electricity prices. The VMD algorithm is used to decompose the complex time series of electricity prices into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different center frequencies. The CNN is used to further extract the time-domain features for all the intrinsic model functions in the VMD domain. The GRU is then employed to process and learn the time-domain features extracted by the CNN, leading to the final prediction. A comparison is made with five models, such as LSTM, CNN, VMD-CNN, BP, VMD-ELMAN. The results showed that the proposed model had the best performance, and it was found that using VMD can improve the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the four seasons by 84% and 81%, respectively. The addition of GRU in the SEPNet model further improved the MAPE and RMSE by 19% and 25%, respectively. Including CNN and VMD-CNN, that shows that the proposed model has the best performance. The MAPE and RMSE for the four seasonal averages are 0.730% and 0.453, respectively. This confirms that the SEPNet model has the feasibility and high accuracy to predict short-term electricity prices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",convolutional neural network; electricity price forecasting; gated recurrent unit; intrinsic mode function; variational mode decomposition,Backpropagation; Convolutional neural networks; Costs; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Internet of things; Mean square error; Power markets; Predictive analytics; Time series; Complex time series; Electricity price forecasting; Intrinsic Mode functions; Mean absolute percentage error; Neural network model; Root mean square errors; Seasonal differences; Time domain features; Long short-term memory,Article
"Gundu V., Simon S.P.",PSO–LSTM for short term forecast of heterogeneous time series electricity price signals,2020,,"Electricity price forecasting plays an important role in the power system network, in order to promote the decision-making process for power generation and consumption. Long term forecasting is not viable as there is an uncertainty in the forecast due to increasing the integration of renewable sources with the existing grids. Since the behavior of the electricity price time sequence signal is highly non-linear and seasonal, deep neural network is the best model for learning the non-linear behavior within the data and for the purpose of forecasting. Hence this paper proposes an enhanced particle swarm optimization based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model, which is used to forecast the closing price of the Indian Energy Exchange. Particle swarm optimization technique is used to optimize the LSTM network input weights, which in turn minimize the forecast error with reduced architecture.

This information would help to perform long-term energy system analysis considering growing wind energy penetration. The actual hourly wind production and power consumption data as well as electricity prices from the year 2019 were used in the analysis. Results of the study revealed that in the analysed dataset there is no correlation between the share of wind power and the power prices, i.e. R-squared value is 0.003 for the Baltic region and 0.0064 for both trading areas of Denmark. In contrast, the R-squared value was almost 0.6 for a positive correlation between power demand and prices. The results mean that expected loss of interest to invest due to falling power prices, as a share of renewable power increases, should be examined more carefully and may not fulfil forecasts of policy makers and industry experts. © 2020 Gunars Valdmanis et al., published by Sciendo 2020.",Electricity market; electricity prices; renewable energy sources; wind power,alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; energy use; price dynamics; wind power; Denmark,Article

However, it is very difficult to estimate the electricity energy production in advance and store the rest of the electric energy due to the climate, environment, population and other factors. Based on data preprocessing and artificial intelligence optimization algorithm, this paper introduces a combined forecasting method. The proposed method contains six individual methods, and each individual method has its own usage. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is adopted to reduce noise from the original data; three individual forecasting methods, Jordan neural network, the echo state network, least squares support vector machine, are applied to obtain the intermediate forecasting results; two optimization algorithms, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing, are used to optimize the parameters of the combined model. This paper not only validates the superiority of the combined model compared to the single predictive model through the simulation experiments of power load data and electricity price data. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of the combined power load and electricity price forecast results are 1.14% and 7.58%, respectively, which are higher than the MAPE error of the corresponding single models prediction results. It has also been verified that the process of eliminating noise by the SSA plays a positive role in the accuracy of the combined forecasting model. In addition, two series of experiments on the power load data lead to two very interesting conclusions. One of the conclusions is that as the size of the test data increases, the prediction accuracy of the model decreases; the other is that the predicted result calculated through the optimized combined weight is better than the combined result calculated using the average weight, and the average weight is used. Weighted combination does not improve the prediction accuracy of a single model. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",ESN network; Jordan neural network; LSSVM; Power load and price forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis,Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Particle size analysis; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Simulated annealing; Spectrum analysis; Support vector machines; Combined forecasting; Echo state networks; Jordan neural networks; Least squares support vector machines; Optimization algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Short term electric load; Singular spectrum analysis; Electric load forecasting,Article
"Agurto R., Fuentes F., García C.J., Skoknic E.",The macroeconomic impact of the electricity price: lessons from Chile,2020,,"This article presents the hypothesis that exogenous shocks in the electricity market, through variations in prices that are independent of changes in oil prices, may affect the business cycle of the Chilean economy in the short and medium term. The results of our research confirm this hypothesis: shocks of different signs that modify investment in power generation—delays or new investment in renewable energies—have played an important role in the fluctuation of the business cycle. For example, the comparison of different scenarios reveals that after a few years, delays could have caused losses of around 6.0% of GDP growth, because the price of electricity would have been far from its equilibrium value for a long time. Therefore, without the strong investment in renewables, among other technologies, the delays would have materialized, resulting in relevant costs to the economy. These results have important policy implications. Chile has been a leader in Latin America in terms of electricity market reform since 1982. Therefore, it is essential to study possible changes in the Chilean electricity market, to the extent that it could lead other countries to question the benefits of implementing similar market reforms, especially if negative shocks in the electricity generation sector are not compensated by new investments. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bayesian estimation; Business cycle; Electric energy; Macroeconomics models,,Article

"Gupta S., Chakrabarti D., Roy H.",Electricity prices determinants: India’s perspective,2020,,"A robust trading system is vital to promote competition in the Indian electricity market. In India, the exchange trading market is still at an incipient stage, despite being the best option for innovation, due to the presence of high volatility huge losses are incurred by the power market participants such as power generators and distribution companies. Hence, a descriptive research was conducted to identify the major factors leading to the periods of spikes and jumps in the Indian energy exchange’s day-ahead market (DAM) prices of all the regions (north, south, east, west and north east) from August 2008 until June 2017. It was found that the major factors affecting DAMs prices are regulatory, weather, fuel supply, transmission congestion; power plant outages/new plants operational, frequency and reservoir levels. This study will encourage the stakeholders to further model and forecast prices devising profit maximisation techniques thereon.

"Dagoumas A., Koltsaklis N.",Zonal pricing in Kazakhstan power system with a unit commitment model,2020,,"Developing economies are in process of liberalizing their electricity markets, following similar process in developed economics. This process aims at establishing liquid energy exchanges that provide clear price signals, providing indications on the profitability of different operations: Production, retail, trading in interconnections. This paper aims at developing a unit commitment model for examining zonal market pricing in Kazakhstan. The latter has an extensive landscape but sparsely populated, while is also characterized by the high availability of domestic fossil fuels, but located in different sub-regions of the country. The provision of zonal price signals in such a power system in invaluable, as it enables the provision of clear price signals on the needed infrastructure and the estimation of the zonal hourly energy and technology mix. Moreover, in enables the formation of dynamic bidding strategies by market participants in cases with favourable conditions, such as the implementation of scarcity pricing. This paper presents a unit commitment model that used to assess different bidding strategies and to provide zonal price signals. The strategies are formed, depending on the technology type and fuel prices comparison. Results provide clear signals on needed infrastructure among zones in Kazakhstan. It also shows that dynamic biding can lead to market coupling.

"Guerini A., Marziali A., De Nicolao G.",MCMC calibration of spot-prices models in electricity markets,2020,,"The calibration of some stochastic differential equation used to model spot prices in electricity markets is investigated. As an alternative to relying on standard likelihood maximization, the adoption of a fully Bayesian paradigm is explored, that relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) stochastic simulation and provides the posterior distributions of the model parameters. The proposed method is applied to one- and two-factor stochastic models, using both simulated and real data. The results demonstrate good agreement between the maximum likelihood and MCMC point estimates. The latter approach, however, provides a more complete characterization of the model uncertainty, an information that can be exploited to obtain a more realistic assessment of the forecasting error. In order to further validate the MCMC approach, the posterior distribution of the Italian electricity price volatility is explored for different maturities and compared with the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",electricity markets; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; mean-reverting commodity price; multifactor model; stochastic differential equations; volatility,Calibration; Commerce; Costs; Differential equations; Markov processes; Maximum likelihood estimation; Monte Carlo methods; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Commodity prices; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Multifactor models; Stochastic differential equations; volatility; Stochastic models,Conference Paper

In this work two neighboring regions in the NordPool market are analyzed to provide day-ahead electrical price forecasting using regression techniques. The characteristics of the NordPool market trading behavior leads to unanticipated price peaks at daily, weekly and annual level. The considered two Nordic regions have different energy generation sources (e.g Norway has controllable hydro power, Denmark has non-controllable wind-power) therefore day-ahead electrical energy price forecasting in deregulated market for these two neighboring countries can impact the energy generation dynamics. Due to the dynamics of the electricity markets and region divisions this work proposes electric energy price forecasting using regression tools based in the k-Nearest Neighbor regressor, to capture the small increments in changing price behavior, and an autoregressor on top to capture the finite gradient of the occasional spikes in the price cycles. The electric energy price forecasting analysis of these two regions have shown that there is much more accurate forecasting in the Norwegian market compared to Danish market.

The scientific research of the using of different mathematical methods and models for forecasting the dynamics of the day or weekly-ahead electricity prices is an important scientific issue. The aim of this paper is to present a scientific approach for electricity prices forecasting, via the analysis of the time series using the mathematical method of Hurst parameter, called the rescaled range (R/S) method. This method is used for distinguishing completely random time series from correlated time series in process of modeling and forecasting of day-ahead electricity market. The mathematical analysis is based on the information from the Bulgarian day-ahead electricity market. © 2019 Copyright Association for Computing Machinery.",Day-ahead market; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Hurst analysis; Multi-scaling,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Risk management; Time series; Time series analysis; Day ahead market; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices forecasting; Hurst analysis; Modeling and forecasting; Multiscaling; Production and consumption; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Nascimento J., Pinto T., Vale Z.",Day-ahead electricity market price forecasting using artificial neural network with spearman data correlation,2019,,"Electricity markets are complex environments with very dynamic characteristics. The large-scale penetration of renewable energy sources has brought an increased uncertainty to generation, which is consequently, reflected in electricity market prices. In this way, novel advanced forecasting methods that are able to predict electricity market prices taking into account the new variables that influence prices variation are required. This paper proposes a new model for day-ahead electricity market prices forecasting based on the application of an artificial neural network. The main novelty of this paper relates to the pre-processing phase, in which the relevant data referring to the different variables that have a direct influence on market prices such as generation, temperature, consumption, among others, is analysed. The association between these variables is performed using spearman correlation, from which results the identification of which data has a larger influence on the market prices variation. This pre-analysis is then used to adapt the training process of the artificial neural network, leading to improved forecasting results, by using the most relevant data in an appropriate way. © 2019 IEEE.",Artificial neural networks; Day-ahead spot market; Electricity price; Forecasting; Spearman correlation,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Neural networks; Renewable energy resources; Advanced forecasting; Complex environments; Day-ahead electricity market; Dynamic characteristics; Electricity prices; Renewable energy source; Spearman correlation; Spot market; Power markets,Conference Paper

Here, we have studied that influence by constructing predictive models of electricity price and daily returns at two major wholesale electricity trading hubs in the US. We have made extensive use of machine learning techniques. The key innovations from this study are (1) identification of Neural Network Multilayer Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines as being the most effective models for predicting next-day electricity price and returns respectively, and (2) discovery of a shift in the long-established trend as we found that solar irradiance takes over temperature as the dominant weather-related variable to influence electricity price as solar penetration grows in a region. © 2019 IEEE.",Data science; Energy markets; Machine learning; Predictive models; Solar energy,Commerce; Costs; Data Science; Learning systems; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Solar energy; Support vector machines; Electricity trading; Energy markets; Machine learning techniques; Predictive modeling; Predictive models; Renewable energy source; Supply-demand balances; Wholesale electricity; Power markets,Conference Paper

Understanding the main drivers of the electricity price is a key aspect in understanding price formation and in developing forecasting models, which are essential for the selling and buying strategies of market agents. For this analysis, different techniques have been applied in this work, including standard and lasso regression models, causal analysis based on Bayesian networks and classification trees. Results from the different approaches are coherent and show strong dependency of the electricity prices with the Portuguese imported coal for lower non-dispatchable net demands, which has been progressively replaced by gas for larger non-dispatchable net demands.

"Yousefi A., Sianaki O.A., Sharafi D.",Long-Term Electricity Price Forecast Using Machine Learning Techniques,2019,,"Predicting the performance of energy commodities has long been a global priority for researchers and investors in the Energy sector. Large green field and brown field projects (often exceeding 1bn USD) are financed with locked in capital from the start, and typically take decades to return. Despite being one of the most important aspects of investment decision making, the prediction methodologies used widely today are not sophisticated enough to provide accurate insights for the investors. The new approach was proposed in this research to provide data analytics backed analysis for the performance of energy related commodities using innovative feature discovery methods and machine learning tools. In the presented research, a machine learning model was trained to predict the average monthly price of electricity in the next 5 years with focus on the California State energy market. Data points from 2001 to 2017 were collected and 78 data points are considered for analyses to select the highly-correlated features which could potentially affect the electricity price in the medium to long term. An economic case study is undertaken to understand the correlation of the features, and to avoid multicollinearity. In the next step, the selected features are applied into an S-ARIMA time series prediction algorithm. In addition, several feature-based machine learning algorithms are applied to the data and the results analysed and compared to find the effective forcasting approach. The findings demonstrated promising results for three years future price prediction horizon. Further studies are required to get more accurate electricity results beyond three years horizon. © 2019 IEEE.",Clustering; Energy Price Prediction; Feature Correlation Analysis; Machine Learning Algorithms; Random Forests; Time Series Analysis,Clustering algorithms; Data Analytics; Decision making; Decision trees; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Investments; Learning systems; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Smart power grids; Time series analysis; Clustering; Energy prices; Feature correlation; Investment decision making; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Prediction methodology; Random forests; Learning algorithms,Conference Paper

"Facchini A., Rubino A., Caldarelli G., Di Liddo G.",Changes to Gate Closure and its impact on wholesale electricity prices: The case of the UK,2019,,"The electricity supply industry in the United Kingdom underwent a number of regulatory reforms since late 80's that have transformed the trading and pricing of the energy market. Herein we provide empirical evidence that the Modification Proposal P12 (Mod P12) - that took place in 7/2/2002 - moving the Gate Closure (GC) interval from 3.5 h to 1 h before real time has caused a permanent alteration in the UK spot price volatility. Using a combination of Recurrence Plot (RP) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) we find that, after the the change in the GC time, short term price volatility significantly decreased between 2001 and 2008 while long term price volatility is not affected by CG change. Similar results are obtained by means of spectral analysis on the price series, showing a significant reduction in its variability. The results of our analysis suggest that a dynamical regime shift of the price occurred, and such shift is linked to the GC change whereby shorter GC intervals facilitate short-term forecasting on electricity demand and better reliability on the supply side. Therefore, GC closer to real time is associated to reduced price fluctuations in the wholesale market. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Electricicty markets; Gate Closure UK Spot prices; New Electricity Trading arrangements; Recurrence Plots,Commerce; Costs; Reliability analysis; Spectrum analysis; Speech processing; Electricity demands; New electricity trading arrangements; Recurrence plot; Recurrence quantification analysis; Short-term forecasting; Spot price; Spot price volatility; Wholesale electricity; Power markets; demand elasticity; electricity industry; electricity supply; energy policy; price dynamics; regulatory approach; United Kingdom,Article

Second, the nonlinear features and invariant structures of each frequency are completely extracted by layer-wise pre-training based SAEs. The effectiveness of the proposed prediction method is verified by using actual price data from the Australian electricity market. The experimental results show that the proposed method obtains more accurate prediction, better versatility and practicability compared with several other prediction methods. © 2018 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

"Tasneem F., Waters G.",Forecasting MISO electricity prices: A threshold autoregressive approach with load data,2018,,"Electricity price dynamics for the Illinois market are examined by estimating eleven different threshold autoregressive models and comparing according to fit and forecasting performance. The threshold is endogenous and depends on load data in three of the cases. A theoretical model demonstrates that supply constraints could explain price spikes and that prices would display less persistence in those cases. Estimation results confirm that presence of non-linearity in the evolution of prices. However, inclusion of the load data does not improve performance, which provides evidence against this hypothesis. The model where the threshold depends on the change in the past price is best. © 2018, University of Nebraska.

Smart grids use ancillary services & demand response programs to manage any demand fluctuations. Independent System Operators (ISOs) & Regional Transmission Organisations (RTO) are responsible for keeping the grid balanced with generation & load. Power Grid Corporation (ISO), Indian Energy Exchange (ISO) & Kerala State Electricity Board (RTO) are the key players who perform this function for Kerala region. IEX manage the energy markets by operating three submarkets day-ahead, real-time& capacity markets. Through day-ahead market, electricity generators &load-serving entities submit their bids to receive & offer electricity to the power grid based on varying cost on each hour for the next operating day. In the real-time market, ISO & RTOs manage these changes in production & consumption throughout the day. They optimize the generation dispatch schedule where they consider generation cost & transmission constraints. Capacity markets are employed to have study flow of capital investments in the market thereby increasing the generation capacity. Currently, KSEB forecast & schedule power generation to ensure sufficient power is available at its disposal for transmission. But with generation capacity standing at a mere 30% of demand, it has to depend upon bulk purchases. To bring transparency to KSEB’s procurement programme, the Kerala state regulatory commission (erc Kerala) have provided adequate guidelines to consider commodity markets as well along with its traditional flat-ratecontracts. On this research study, we are forecasting day-ahead electricity spot price at IEX Kerala region using modern electrometric techniques. The time series analysis of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is applied to the historical IEX spot price data starting from 1st February 2017 to 31st January of 2018. In every deregulated electricity market, it’s a practice to perform the price forecasting first and then to prepare the bids accordingly. KSEB can also apply this technique to improve their procurement efficiency. From 2017 onwards, IEX has created a new separate bid region for the Kerala market, making Kerala specific market study very relevant. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

To address the profit maximization problem for power generation groups in day-ahead market, this paper proposes a medium- and long-term optimal scheduling model for cascade reservoirs, taking complex hydraulic and electric couplings into consideration. The day-ahead market transaction price of cascade reservoirs is forecasted through electricity price prediction method based on support vector machine algorithm.

The best twenty predictors of the EEM2016 EPF competition are used to create ensembles of hourly spot price forecasts. For each hour, the parameter values of the probability density function (PDF) of a Beta distribution for the output variable (hourly price) can be directly obtained from the expected and variance values associated to the ensemble for such hour, using three aggregation strategies of predictor forecasts corresponding to three PPFMCP models. A Reliability Indicator (RI) and a Loss function Indicator (LI) are also introduced to give a measure of uncertainty of probabilistic price forecasts. The three PPFMCP models were satisfactorily applied to the real-world case study of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). Results from PPFMCP models showed that PPFMCP model 2, which uses aggregation by weight values according to daily ranks of predictors, was the best probabilistic meta-model from a point of view of mean absolute errors, as well as of RI and LI. PPFMCP model 1, which uses the averaging of predictor forecasts, was the second best meta-model.

"Nair I., Robert A.",A chaotic model approach for electricity price forecasting in Indian scenario,2017,,"In a deregulated power market, the electricity prices exhibit extreme volatility due to its non-storable nature, supply constraints at peak hours, transmission line congestion at peak hours and seasonal and diurnal variations. The objective of this paper is to model the day-ahead market price of Indian energy exchange (IEX) based on time series modelling approach. The detailed analysis of market clearing price (MCP) collected from IEX clearly indicates the chaotic nature of data. It is because of this chaotic behaviour, the phase space of the time series data is reconstructed using Taken's theorem. With the concept of the add-weighted one-rank multi-step model, the MCP of IEX is modelled as a chaotic model from this reconstructed phase space. Furthermore, the developed chaotic model is verified for forecasting MCP and the simulation results demonstrate that the chaotic model developed outperforms the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model in terms of in sample forecasting performances.

In short term forecast, electricity price can be predicted for an hour-ahead or day-ahead. An hour-ahead prediction offers the market members with the pre-dispatch prices for the next hour. It is useful for an effective bidding strategy where the quantity of bids can be revised or changed prior to the dispatch hour. However, only a few studies have been conducted in the field of hour-ahead forecasting. This is due to most of the power markets apply two-settlement market structure (day-ahead and real time) or standard market design rather than single-settlement system (real time). Therefore, a multistage optimization for hybrid Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model is developed in this study to provide an accurate price forecast with optimized parameters and input features. So far, no literature has been found on multistage feature and parameter selections using the methods of LSSVM-GA for hour-ahead price prediction. All the models are examined on the Ontario power market; which is reported as among the most volatile market worldwide.

In this study, linear prediction methods and neural networks and fuzzy logic have been studied and emulated. An optimized fuzzy-wavelet prediction method is proposed to predict the price of electricity. In this method, in order to have a better prediction, the membership functions of the fuzzy regression along with the type of the wavelet transform filter have been optimized using the E.Coli Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm. Then, to better compare this optimal method with other prediction methods including conventional linear prediction and neural network methods, they were analyzed with the same electricity price data. In fact, our fuzzy-wavelet method has a more desirable solution than previous methods. More precisely by choosing a suitable filter and a multiresolution processing method, the maximum error has improved by 13.6%, and the mean squared error has improved about 17.9%. In comparison with the fuzzy prediction method, our proposed method has a higher computational volume due to the use of wavelet transform as well as double use of fuzzy prediction.

But in practice, the real problems that must be faced are that both future electricity prices and costs are unknown. Thus, the first ones must be modelled and forecasted and the costs must be calculated.

The second step is the cost calculation on internal system taking into account the expected prices in the first step. The third step is based on the results of the previous steps, and consists of preparing the bids for external markets with the focus on the consumer's cost.

"Singh N., Tiwari S., Mohanty S.R., Yadav D.",A modified cost function generalized neuron for electricity price forecasting in deregulated power markets,2015,,"Price forecasting has become one of the key factors for competition in the deregulated electricity market and it is necessary to know future electricity prices for generating companies as their profitability depends on them. The precision of the price forecasting model is essential in bidding strategies. The major problem with the models based on artificial neural networks is that they usually need a large number of training data and neurons. To overcome these issues, a new structure using generalized neurons (GN) is being adopted which require smaller data set for training which makes it very useful for price forecasting for places where historical data available is not sufficient to use ANN. In the proposed work, a hybrid model using generalized neuron is used for comparing the performance using different cost functions. © 2015 ACM.",Error functions; Generalized neuron model; Price forecasting; Wavelet transform,Commerce; Cost functions; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Neurons; Wavelet transforms; Deregulated electricity market; Deregulated power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Error function; Generalized neuron; Generating companies; Price forecasting; Power markets,Conference Paper
"Kalczynski P., Zerom D.",Price forecast valuation for the nyiso electricity market,2015,,"Purpose – Following the deregulation of electricity markets in the USA, independent power producers operate as for-profit entities. Their profit depends on the price of electricity and an accurate forecast is critical in making bidding decisions on the electricity and reserve markets or engaging in bilateral contracts. Competing price forecasts have their accuracy expressed in statistical terms but producers need to determine the long-term value of using a given forecast. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue by presenting a method of electricity price forecast valuation which compares forecast models using financial rather than statistical measures. Design/methodology/approach – The objectives of this paper are achieved by mathematical modeling of thermal power plants and price forecast information available to market participants and simulating the operation of a thermal power plant using various price forecasts and perfect information (as a baseline). The operating profit calculated over a long period was used for ranking forecast models. Findings – The framework can be used to estimate the value of a new price forecast as well as to determine if potential gains from developing or acquiring a new forecast will justify the expenses. The results show that an improvement in terms of statistical forecast accuracy measures does not guarantee increased profit. Practical implications – This paper presents a new method for comparing electricity price forecast models. It can be adapted to various types of thermal power plants that operate on liberalized electricity markets and utilize price-based dynamic economic dispatch models. Originality/value – This paper presents a simulation-based valuation framework for short-term electricity price. The approach described in this paper can be utilized by independent power producers for different types of generators, operating on deregulated electricity markets. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Decision making; Modelling; Simulation; System dynamics,Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Deregulation; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Models; Power markets; Profitability; Scheduling; Thermoelectric power plants; Deregulated electricity market; Design/methodology/approach; Dynamic economic dispatch; Independent power producers; Liberalized electricity market; Perfect informations; Simulation; System Dynamics; Electric load dispatching,Article

In this paper we present a means of optimizing a production run for the following day and week given basic constraints on the start and end times of production shifts as well as the total production within a specified time frame (planning horizon). The general problem is a difficult, non-convex optimization problem over stochastic variables that can only be solved in its original form by global optimization and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. However, reasonable approximations to the original problems render it more tractable. By linearizing the energy price forecasts and the plant consumption profile, as well as discretizing the stochastic variables involved, we can reduce the planning problem to a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem, with the customary linear bounds.",Day-ahead energy price forecasting; Industrial load scheduling; Variable energy pricing,Constrained optimization; Convex optimization; Costs; Forecasting; Global optimization; Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Production control; Quadratic programming; Stochastic systems; Energy prices; Energy pricing; Industrial loads; Mixed integer quadratic programming; Monte carlo simulation technique; Nonconvex optimization; Production schedule; Stochastic variable; Power markets,Conference Paper
Dash S.K.,A hybrid ARMA-Legendre polynomial neural network and evolutionary H-infinity filter for the prediction of electricity market clearing price,2015,,"A hybrid adaptive autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and Legendre polynomial neural network trained by an evolutionary H-infinity filter is presented in this paper for predicting short-Term electricity prices in a deregulated market. The proposed model comprises a linear autoregressive (AR) part and nonlinear moving average (MA) part obtained through the use of Legendre polynomial basis functions. The Legendre polynomial functional block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher dimensional space through basis functions without using any hidden layer like the multilayered perceptron (MLP) network. Instead of using the standard forward-backward (FB-LMS) algorithm for learning the weight parameters of the ARMALEG (hybrid ARMA and Legendre network) a robust H-infinity filter is used which is superior to the widely used extended Kalman filter in terms of handling uncertain noise covariances resulting in fast convergence and tracking. Further to improve the accuracy, the H-infinity filter parameters are optimised using a differential evolution (DE) strategy. The proposed method is tested on PJM electricity market and the residuals (MAPE) are compared with other forecasting methods indicating the improved accuracy of the approach and its suitability to produce a real-Time forecast.

"Rajaraman B., Vesovic B.",Convergence of prices and efficiency of day-ahead markets,2014,,"The constantly changing grid operating conditions, the need to maintain a balance between demand and supply of electricity in real time, and the evolution of an electricity market in certain electric interconnections of the world, are some of the characteristics of today's electric power systems. The interlaced design of a power system and electricity market operations are closely linked with the system reliability and electricity market efficiency. Accurate convergence of prices between the day-ahead electricity markets (DAM) and the associated real time energy markets (RTM) is a good indicator of a well functioning electricity market. Consistency between DAM and RTM prices is beneficial for market efficiency because it helps ensure that the resources committed each day are the most economic and efficient ones to meet the system demand in real time, thereby preserving system reliability and security. The divergence of RTM electricity prices from DAM electricity prices imposes unnecessary additional inefficiencies and costs on the system, thereby potentially threatening system reliability. Virtual bidding in the day-ahead market provides a useful function in facilitating price convergence between the day ahead and real time markets. The arbitrage possibilities enabled by virtual bidding are also useful mechanisms for improving efficiency in the electricity markets. By adding liquidity to the market, virtual bidding significantly helps in reducing market risk for participants and considerably reduces price volatility as well. Network congestion, which is also seen as a key reason for price spikes and consequently price divergence in electricity markets can be managed efficiently and effectively by implementing a full network model. A detailed and accurate representation of the power system, which aids in the determination and mitigation of transmission constraints, will lead to consistency of congestion patterns between DAM and RTM, thereby contributing to improved convergence of electricity prices in market operations. The insufficient ramping capability in any system may trigger power balance violations resulting in an infeasible real time dispatch that cannot maintain supply and demand power balance. In such scenarios, the system has to rely on regulation services to resolve the issue in real-time after the imbalance has caused area control error (ACE) deviation. If there is insufficient regulation service, the shortage in ramping capability may result in leaning on the interconnection, which is an undesirable outcome. Moreover, when power balance is violated, the RTM energy price is not priced by economic bids, but by administrative penalty prices, which may impact market efficiency in the long run. These price spikes generally may be avoided by further modelling and dispatch improvements that increase the accuracy and flexibility of real-time dispatches. Market design improvements such as implementation of flexible ramp system constraints, that ensure additional unloaded online capacity that is available and ramp feasible, and can be dispatched at any time interval in either upward or downward direction by designating a system ramp margin, must be made available. This paper discusses several aspects needed for improved price convergence and thereby increased efficiency in electricity markets, such as virtual bidding, flexible ramping constraints, implementing a full network model for alleviating network congestion, advanced forecasting systems and demand response. The paper also provides illustrations and examples to demonstrate the impact of price convergence on market efficiency. © 2014 CIGRE.

"Zhou Z., Botterud A.",Price responsive demand for operating reserves and energy in electricity markets with wind power,2013,,"Similar to demand response for energy, operating reserve can be elastic to prices given that minimal reliability criteria are satisfied. We present a probabilistic-based framework to estimate a demand curve for operating reserves.

The resulting demand for reserves is dynamically scheduled and co-optimized with energy in the market clearing. In a case study, the framework is applied to a two-settlement electricity market with centralized unit commitment, also considering demand response for energy. We find that the proposed demand curve for operating reserves contributes to improved handling of system uncertainties and more efficient pricing of operating reserves.

One opportunity is represented by variable grid fees which enable a causation-based allocation of grid costs and a higher predictability concerning power system planning.

"Bosco B., Parisio L., Pelagatti M.",Optimal pricing behavior of vertically integrated utilities: Theory and evidence from the Italian electricity wholesale market,2013,,"In this paper we present a model of supply prices coordination in electricity markets in which a group of firms is vertically integrated. We show that vertical integration, i.e. the presence of a supplier and a buyer belonging to the same coordinated group, represents an obstacle to the full exploitation of market power on the part of generators. This empirical evidence is still in search of a theoretical explanation and this paper contributes to the existing literature by offering both a theoretical discussion and an empirical investigation. The latter is conducted using Italian electricity auction data and shows that bid prices of generators are significantly affected (i.e. moderated) by variables incorporating vertical integration into the econometric model.

"Hajiabadi M.E., Rajabi Mashhadi H.",Modeling of the maximum entropy problem as an optimal control problem and its application to pdf estimation of electricity price,2013,,"This paper proposes a novel two step modeling and analysis on the continuous random variable of electricity price. At the first step, the continuous optimal control theory is used to model and solve the maximum entropy problem for a continuous random variable. The maximum entropy principle provides a method to obtain least-biased Probability Density Function (pdf) estimation. In this paper, to find a closed form solution for the maximum entropy problem with any number of moment constraints, the entropy is considered as a functional measure and the moment constraints are considered as the state equations. Therefore, the pdf estimation problem can be reformulated as the optimal control problem. At the second step, the proposed unbiased pdf estimator is used to estimate the pdf of electricity price. Moreover, the statistical indices and the distributional characteristics of electricity price are analyzed at each load level. The simulation results on the electricity price data of New England, Ontario and Nord Pool electricity markets show the efficiency of the proposed pdf estimator. In addition, the obtained results show that by decreasing the load, the statistical and distributional characteristics of the electricity price inclined toward the statistical properties of the normal distribution.",Electricity price; Maximum entropy (ME); Optimal control; Probability density function (pdf),,Article

Several features of the electricity markets inspire the experimental design. Two treatments with different price caps are considered and demand is high in certain periods, and low in others. In addition the market is characterized by excess capacity regardless of the demand level and competitive outcome is predicted. Although attempts to collude do take place, these fail to increase market prices in any substantial way. Despite this, inefficiencies do occur as the attempts at colluding imply that marginal costs fail to equalize across firms.

"Al-Ajlouni A.F., Yamin H.Y., Eyadeh A.",Price volatility forecasting using artificial neural networks in emerging electricity markets,2012,,"In the adaptive short-term electricity price forecasting, it may be premature to rely solely on the hourly price forecast. The volatility of electricity price should also be analysed to provide additional insight on price forecasting. This paper proposes a price volatility module to analyse electricity price spikes and study the probability distribution of electricity price. Two methods are used to study the probability distribution of electricity price; the analytical method and the ANN method. Furthermore, ANN method is used to study the impact of line limits, line outages, generator outages, load pattern and bidding strategy on short term price forecasting, in addition to sensitivity analysis to determine the extent to which these factors impact price forecasting. Data used in this study are spot electricity prices from California market in the period which includes the crisis months where extreme volatility was observed.

"De Weerdt M., Ketter W., Collins J.",Pricing mechanism for real-time balancing in regional electricity markets,2011,,"In electricity markets, supply and demand have to be balanced perfectly in real time. A major task of the Independent Systems Operator (ISO)2 on the wholesale (transmission) level and of the Distribution Utility (DU) on the regional (distribution) level is to monitor the grid and to maintain balance while keeping voltage, frequency, and power factor within very tight bounds. This task gets more challenging as more renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are connected to the grid [2]. Many of these sources (e.g. wind) are only partially predictable. The grid balancing problem has been studied on various levels (wholesale vs. retail) and with different approaches [1]. We study the problem of how to determine the price that energy brokers (retailers) need to pay in case their profile of consumption and production of electricity is imbalanced in the current time slot.3 In a retail electricity market, brokers have the possibility to control some portion of customer production and consumption, such as by offering price concessions in exchange for the ability to remotely interrupt loads or sources for limited periods of time. Examples of such controllable loads are remotely controlled CHPs (Combined Heat and Power - gas turbines that supply both heat and power, and allow some control of production) and domestic water heaters that can be remotely turned off to temporarily reduce consumption. We present two different scenarios and the related market mechanisms to balance supply and demand: I) without controllable loads, and II) with controllable loads for the current time slot. Our main mechanisms for a regional real-time balancing market are efficient, and create an incentive to resolve imbalances in the day-ahead market. An advantage of our methods is that they are compatible with existing energy market structures (keeping the day-ahead market as a given), and therefore the required restructuring would be less disruptive than with other methods currently suggested.",,Balancing market; Balancing problems; Combined heat and power; Controllable loads; Customer production; Day ahead market; Distribution utilities; Domestic water heaters; Electricity market; Existing energies; Heat and power; Independent systems; Market mechanisms; Power factors; Price concessions; Pricing mechanism; Real time; Regional electricity markets; Renewable energy source; Retail electricity markets; Supply and demand; Tight bound; Time slots; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Electric power factor; Electricity; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Water heaters; Economics,Conference Paper

"Zhang J., Yu C., Hou G.",Application of chaotic particle swarm optimization in the short-term electricity price forecasting,2011,,"The market-oriented reform of the electric power industry is a trend around the world, electricity price issues are the key problems in the power markets and how to price the special commodity-electricity is essential for the smooth market operation. Accurate price forecasting provides crucial information for electricity market participants to make reasonable competing strategies, which is related to the position and benefit of the market participators. So using the relative historic data in predicting the future electricity price is a very meaningful work. With comprehensive considerations of the fluctuation rules and the various influencing factors on the forming of price in the power market, a short-term electricity price forecasting method based on the time series ARMAX model was chosen in this paper.

The VSC is included in a multi-objective optimal power flow (OPF) that maximizes the social benefit. Ancillary service (reactive power) and system congestion has been considered in the pricing. Effect ofN-1 contingency on pricing is also analyzed. Pricing is decided one day ahead using forecasted demand data. The OPF is solved by linear programming method. The system is divided into three areas for which total transfer capacity (TTC) is calculated by repeated power flow technique. The available transfer capacity decides the amount of congestion that affects the pricing. The voltage stability is ascertained by checking the singularity of the system Jacobian matrix. Finally, effect of line/generator loss on pricing system is studied.

Helmke A.C.,"Wind energy auction in Brazil prices, barriers, opportunities",2010,,"Since a severe energy crisis in 2001, Brazil has been exploring the vast potential - estimated at between 60 and 143 GW - of its wind resources. The federal government's promotion scheme Proinfa - based on a feed-in tariff - saw the installation of 1.422 MW. But Proinfa did not meet all stakeholder expectations. Projects were selected based on the issuing date of the environmental license, and wind turbines were not readily available. As a result Proinfa's tenure was extended twice. However, never before had a programme of its scale been attempted in Latin America. Presently, wind energy production is being encouraged through reverse auctions. This mirrors the Brazilian electricity market, which is also auction based. These auctions award PPAs to the lowest bidder. The first auction for wind energy took place at the end of December 2009. Some 1.800 MW of wind energy were contracted at an average price of approximately 60 Euros/MWh. The first auction drew significant interest from the sector which submitted backlogged projects. Barriers to market development like state-level taxation and grid-connection issues are offset by accessible public loans, several turbine manufacturers operating in Brazil, wind-hydro complementarity, increased political awareness, and the involvement of local utilities in the sector. As the sector has matured, the time to deliver operating projects has arrived. Long term promotion goals should also be formulated. If following these steps Brazil is in an excellent position to be the regional leader in wind energy.",,Brazilian electricity markets; Energy crisis; Federal governments; Feed-in tariff; Grid connections; Latin America; Market development; Operating project; Reverse auction; Time-to-deliver; Wind energy production; Wind resources; Energy policy; Exhibitions; Taxation; Wind power,Conference Paper

As our estimations for Germany's power sector show, these price increases result in substantial windfall profits, giving rise to public skepticism and calls for an auctioning of certificates in the future. While empirical evidence on the ETS' impacts is scant, the findings reviewed here indicate that even in the absence of certificate auctioning, energy-intensive industry sectors may suffer heavily from the ETS-induced electricity price increases.

"J́onsson T., Pinson P., Madsen H.",The effect ofwind power forecasts on electricity prices in Denmark,2008,,"For participants in deregulated energy markets as Nord Pool and EEX, forecasting of the electricity prices can be just as important as load and production forecasts when it comes to controlling production and consumption. Furthermore, price forecasts are paramount when it comes to designing bidding strategies. It is a known fact that electricity prices on the Nord Pool spot market are, in the long run, mainly influenced by the level of water in the reservoirs of the Norwegian and Swedish hydropower plants. However, changes in the water level happen slowly and are therefore not a matter of great relevance when 1 to 36 hour forecasts are made for the prices on Nord Pool spot market. In this paper, the effects of forecasted wind power production on the spot prices in Nord Pool's Western Danish price area (DK-1) are investigated. Moreover, ways of including the forecasted wind power production in a model for the spot price in DK-1 are explored. It turns out that forecasted wind power production has substantial effects on the spot price and even more effects can be found with small modifications. By using conditional parametric models and by converting the forecasted production into a forecasted penetration, a very satisfying degree of explanation can be achieved in forecasting models for the spot prices in DK-1. Given the result of this paper, it is very likely that the same approach to use wind power predictions, will give good results when forecasting the prices on other electricity pools. It is expected that the approach will be highly beneficial both for pools where wind power penetration is relatively high, and for markets with other characteristics, such as regulation markets.",Electricity spot prices; Forecasting; Statistical modeling; Wind power,Bidding strategy; Denmark; Deregulated energy market; Electricity pool; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Forecasting models; Hydropower plants; Parametric models; Power forecast; Price forecasts; Production forecasts; Regulation markets; Spot market; Spot price; Statistical modeling; Wind power penetration; Wind power predictions; Wind power production; Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Exhibitions; Forecasting; Lakes; Reservoirs (water); Water levels; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper

The neural network is a popular feed-forward three-layer model, and the input variables of the neural networks include the historical demand, temperature, weather-related discomfort index, and the day of the week. Secondly, by using the demand forecasted and the past prices, we apply the technique for forecasting the electricity price of the next day. The utility of the proposed technique was verified by using real data of the electric power wholesale spot market.

"Xie L., Zheng H., Fan G.-Y.",Price volatility analysis by Grey disaster theory,2008,,"Since the electricity market came into being, price volatility is along a difficult and unavoidable problem that makes the market participants face with great risks. But due to the short development of the deregulation, price and its relative data are insufficient, and then price researches have become a typical small-sampled problem. No doubt, such data condition have restricted the application and generalization ability of traditional methods. Then volatility analysis on the electricity price is along a focused and hot problem in the research fields of the electricity market. To solve the above problems, a novel model for price volatility analysis is proposed by Grey disaster prediction, which aims at forecasting when the next price volatility will happen. After studying on the tendency when the price volatilities happen, this work builds a Grey Model to performing the price volatility prediction. Finally numerical experiments are applied to test the validity of the proposed model. ©2008 IEEE.",,Accidents; Electric load forecasting; Electronics industry; Forecasting; Industrial electronics; Modal analysis; Occupational risks; Risk assessment; Disaster prediction; Electricity markets; Electricity pricing; Generalization ability; Grey models; Market participants; Numerical experiments; Price volatility; Research fields; Electric network analysis,Conference Paper
"Covas R., Pascual L.",Pricing daily electricity transfer capacities in the Spain - France interconnection,2008,,"Nowadays, it is possible to sell energy across countries using the existing interconnections. In Europe, one example is the interconnection between France and Spain. These interconnections have limited capacity. Therefore, the right to use the interconnections becomes a valuable position for the different companies and players, due to the spread of electricity prices between countries. The transfer capacities are obtained in annual, monthly, daily and intra-day transfer auctions. This fact is well known by market players, who daily attend capacity auctions, on which they bid in order to gain access to the network. Actually, around 26 companies are entitled to attend these auctions. As a first approach, in order to set your bids for the daily auctions, the access to the network is valued through the Black & Scholes Formulas for the European Call Spread Option. This approach is based on forecasts for the hourly prices in both countries, and on the hourly correlation between them. Since selling energy across countries implies, additionally, offer and demand bids for electricity in each country, thus having positive probabilities of negative cashflows, the option to use transfer capacities cannot be priced with the Black-Scholes Formulas. In this work we propose a new way of pricing the daily electricity transfer capacity, where we take into account the trader's daily operation and, therefore, all the inherent risks factors not included in the Black & Scholes world. We support our proposal by comparing our results with real auction values, and the ones obtained with the Black & Scholes approach. ©2008 IEEE.",Conditional expectation; Day and intra-day electricity market; Multivariate normal distribution; Spread option; Transfer capacities auction,Arsenic compounds; Commerce; Computer networks; Costs; Industrial economics; Ketones; Occupational risks; Conditional expectation; Day and intra-day electricity market; Multivariate normal distribution; Spread option; Transfer capacities auction; Electric load forecasting,Conference Paper
"Reji P., Ashok S., Moideenkutty K.M.",Model for electricity price in hydroelectric generating stations under deregulation,2008,,"This paper presents a mathematical model to determine the optimum electricity price in hydroelectric generating stations under deregulated electricity market. Under deregulation, a free market approach to buying and selling the electricity is established. In a deregulated power market, electricity producers generally follow a marginal cost based price fixing strategy. Accordingly, each utility firm follows their own pricing strategy in the market. Absence of a general model to determine the optimal electricity price at the generator end leads to non-standard pricing practices by different generators. The proposed model was formulated based on performance incentive and penalty considering peak/off-peak loads, plant load factor and availability of the plant. The developed model was applied to a typical hydroelectric utility in India to determine the electricity price. Results show that the percentage error in estimated value falls within the limits.",Deregulation; Electricity price; Power market; Profit maximization,Deregulated electricity market; Deregulated power markets; Developed model; Electricity price; Electricity prices; Electricity producers; Free market; General model; Generating stations; Marginal costs; Peak load; Percentage error; Plant load factor; Power markets; Pricing practices; Pricing strategy; Profit maximization; Commerce; Costs; Electric generators; Electric substations; Electric utilities; Electric variables measurement; Electricity; Hydroelectric power plants; Mathematical models; Optimization; Profitability; Deregulation,Article

"Zhou Y., Kato M.",Spot prices modeling for JEPX and its applications,2007,,"All analyses of energy management start with spot prices modeling. Modeling spot prices is becoming a challenging issue under the recent power market deregulation. Generally, there are two approaches for analyzing spot prices. One is cost-based analysis, which focuses on the behavior of time-of-day marginal cost of individual generation companies and power demand. Another is market-based analysis, which mainly studies the causes of price fluctuations and the correlation of prices. This analysis usually uses stochastic approach. However, both of these approaches have weaknesses. For instance, cost-based models are typically not concerned with market data, while market-based approaches are usually not concerned with detailed generation stack production cost. In the present state of affairs, 9 electric utilities in Japan have upper hand power as a seller side in JEPX transaction substantially. Therefore, the compound generation marginal costs, especially the compound time-of-day marginal costs of 9 electric utilities, become major factors in the spot pricing mechanism in JEPX. Based on these facts, the fluctuation mechanism of electricity spot prices in JEPX depends on the supply side to a large extent. So modeling spot prices of JEPX, which consider power demand and supply structures, especially with a focus on the compound marginal generation costs in the 9 electric utilities, will work better than solely using the market model such as stochastic models, or only using the cost-based model such as traditional electric load dispatching (ELD) stack cost calculation. This paper addresses the challenge of building spot prices modeling for JEPX in the following ways: First, we propose a modified hybrid model, which can take not only cost-based issue but also market-based issue into consideration, and, at the same time, decompose the marginal cost function into an expected value division and an indeterminate division. Next, in order to represent the relationship with marginal cost and load, we apply a HILL function, which can well fit the feature of 9 utilities' compound marginal cost, and also propose a method to estimate corresponding parameters. Finally, in order to verify the model, we forecast the spot prices by using this model and compare the result with the actual JEPX data. Forecast errors are relatively small (RMS = 4.6%), which shows that the model fits well the spot pricing mechanism. The results show that the model proposed in this paper can redeem some weaknesses of the cost-based model and the market-based model, and fit the spot pricing mechanism more comprehensively. Our model will be useful in ask/bid-strategies and risk management in power trading.",Electricity market; HILL function; Hybrid model; Marginal cost; Spot price,Electricity market; Hill function; Hybrid model; Marginal costs; Spot price; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric utilities; Energy management; Risk management; Cost benefit analysis,Conference Paper

"Franke M., Kamper A., Eßer A.",Pricing energy in a multi-utility market,2007,,"We present a solution to the problem of tariff design for an energy supplier (utility). The tariffs for electricity and - optionally - heat created with our pricing model are optimal in terms of the utility's profit and take into account the consumers' predicted behavior, their load curve, the utility's generation prices, and prices for trading electricity on a day-ahead market like the European Energy Exchange (EEX). Furthermore, we analyze the repercussions of different assumptions about consumer behavior on a simulated market with four competing utilities. Consumer demand is modeled using an attraction model that reflects consumer inertia. Consumers will not always change their supplier, even if the total energy bill could be reduced by doing so: First, motivation to search for lower prices and to actually switch one's supplier is low, given the small possible savings. Second, legal constraints may demand a minimal contract duration in some countries. The resulting nonlinear profit optimization problem of the suppliers is solved with a genetic algorithm. By varying the attraction parameters and thus representing different degrees of inertia, we observe different developments of the market.",,Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Genetic algorithms; Information analysis; Profitability; Consumer demands; Day ahead market; Energy suppliers; European energy exchanges; Generation prices; Legal constraint; Profit optimization; Utility markets; Consumer behavior,Conference Paper
"Dugan V., Solea R.",Pricing fuzzy models approach for decision-making in power systems electricity transactions,2007,,"The paper uses fuzzy set theory to obtain some fuzzy models which can be useful, each, as a decision - support to estimate an electrical energy (EE) price for consumers. In the same time, according to us, the paper can be a possible benchmark example of approximate reasoning, used as a fuzzy decision-support system. All three fuzzy tariff models developed in fuzzy environment, integrate some specific features of a deregulated electricity market, as in Romania in this transition period: i) in the market is only a single ""seller"", SC Electrica SA (SCESA), i.e. a single-supplier of electrical energy; ii) because of this, the consumers interests, beginning with 1999, are protected by the National Authority of Settlements from Energy (NASE) through some (social) compulsions; iii) the average price of EE ($/MWh) near our market place is, obviously, a real problem (in our case the markets are from: Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia and Moldavia). Not being a competitive environment, the normal practice used in NASE rules as method of EE pricing are average costs, i.e. total costs divided by total sales. The fuzzy method shows how it is possible to perform sensitivity tests on the EE price function model (by changing the parameters of SCESA and NASE), until can obtain an acceptable and true price can be obtained. In this aim, the three fuzzy models use different rules for pricing: conservative, aggressive, and different order of words concerning the rules, and finally doing a comparation among prices and models. Though the paper will not exhaust all fuzzy rules, doubtlessly, create a way of fuzzy reasoning, as a modality to find an EE price.

"Maitani T., Tezuka T.",Evaluation on influence of unstable primary-energy price in a deregulated electric power market analysis based on a simulation model approach,2006,,"The electric power market of Japan has been locally monopolized for a long time. But, like many countries, Japan is moving forward with the deregulation of its electric power industry so that any power generation company could sell electric power in the market. The power price, however, will fluctuate inevitably to balance the power supply and demand. A new appropriate market design is indispensable when introducing new market mechanisms in the electric power market to avoid undesirable results of the market. The first stage of deregulation will be the competition between an existing large-scaled power utility and a new power generation company. In this paper we have investigated the wholesale market with competition of these two power companies based on a simulation model approach. Under the competitive situation the effects of exogenous disturbance may bring serious results and we estimated the influence on the market when the price of fossil fuel rises. The conclusion of this study is that several types of Nash equilibriums have been found in the market: the larger the new power generation company becomes, the higher the electricity price under the Nash equilibriums rises. Because of the difference in their structure of generation capacity, the existing large-scaled power utility gets more profit while the new power generation company loses its profit when the price of fossil fuel rises.",Crude Oil Price; Nash Equilibrium; Power Pool Market; Simulation Analysis,Competition; Computer simulation; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Marketing; Mathematical models; Crude Oil Price; Nash Equilibrium; Power Pool Markets; Simulation Analysis; Electric power systems,Article
"Reinisch W., Tezuka T.",Simulating the Influence of Wind Power Generation on the Electricity Market Price,2005,,"Wind power has recently become quite popular among power generation companies all over the world. In the year 2003 alone 8,133 MW of new installations have been built up. When integrating these huge amount of wind power into an existing power grid and the trading process of a power utility on the electricity market, the uncertainty in wind power generation becomes a critical point. There are basically two viewpoints on this issue. First, operating wind power generation in a power grid needs a high amount of regulation reserve. Therefore wind generation is expensive. On the other hand, wind power generation does not consume fuel and therefore there are no fuel cost. To estimate the consequences of high wind power generation we propose in this paper a simulation model that is capable of simulating spot and ancillary markets, as well as the physical aspects of electricity generation. By simulating the interaction between spot and ancillary market we calculate the development of the electricity prices on the spot market and the ancillary market with growing wind power generation. © 2005, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Pillai N.V.,Time-of-day pricing of electricity- A model and application,2004,,"The present paper attempts at a contribution to time-of-use pricing of electricity. The general result from the traditional theory charges the off-peak consumers marginal operating costs only and the peak users marginal operating plus marginal capacity cost. Theoretical attempts at modification have proved that the traditional conclusion holds only for homogeneous plant capacity (e.g., in one plant case), and in economic loading of two or more plants, the off-peak price also includes a part of capacity costs. This paper, however, shows that if the off-peak period output is explicitly expressed in terms of capacity utilisation of that period, the result will be an off-peak price including a fraction of the capacity cost in proportion to its significance relative to total utilisation. This would appear as a general case, irrespective of the nature of generation technology, that is, ever when there is only one plant. We also give an illustration by estimating marginal costs and peak load prices using time series data on the Kerala power system.",,consumption behavior; electricity supply; pricing policy,Article
"Huang G.M., Lei J.",Data Exchange Pricing for Distributed Multi-Utility Operations,2003,,"During power deregulation, member companies are releasing their transmission grids to form ISOs/RTOs/Mega-RTOs and they cooperate to run the united system while to achieve their own economic goals. Since there are multiple existing state estimators distributed with different owners in one ISO/RTO/Mega-RTO, these neighboring estimators in single power market can exchange their data, where the term 'data' refers to both raw instrumentation data and estimation results of other estimators. It has been demonstrated in our previous publications that carefully selected data exchange schemes improve the quality of estimators in individual entities on both estimation reliability and accuracy. In addition, data exchange is critical for the newly proposed textured distributed state estimation algorithm over the whole Mega-RTO grid. Since all the activities in a market environment need to be evaluated in terms of 'price', the following questions then arise: how to price data exchange activities in a power market? And how to search for the most valuable data exchange schemes in term of market price? In this paper a pricing methodology for data exchange is proposed based on the concept of marginal price. Furthermore, a systematic approach to search for the most valuable data exchange schemes is proposed based on some heuristic rules.

"Muchayi Maxwell, El-Hawary M.E.",Method for optimal pricing of electric supply including transmission system considerations,1997,,"Determining real-time electricity rate structures is currently receiving a great deal attention. In this paper, a strategy for pricing electricity supply is formulated and evaluated. Unlike other methods which use only the variation of fuel cost for generation to estimate the rate structures, the proposed pricing algorithm incorporates the optimal allocation of transmission system operating costs based on time-of-use pricing. The transmission costs are obtained by assigning a price k to each unit of power flow in the network. The assignment does not discriminate between participants located at differing parts of the network. The real-time pricing reflects the instantaneous cost of production and functions as a load management tool because this interacts with consumer behavior. The demand for power flows and transmission on an electricity supply system, like the demand for any bundle of economic goods, depends upon the assigned transmission prices, together with the economic benefit to the consumer. It is assumed that there are no privately owned generating plants and that all plants and transmission lines are operated by the utility. The modeling scheme is applied to the IEEE standard 5, 14, 30 and 57 bus power systems and involves solving a modified optimal power flow problem (OPF) iteratively using the MINOS package. It is concluded that the method has a wide potential application in electricity supply pricing.",,Algorithms; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Electric rates; Industrial economics; Iterative methods; Optimization; Resource allocation; Standards; Transmission network calculations; Electricity supply pricing; Software package MINOS; Electric utilities,Conference Paper

Schramm G.,Relative price changes and the benefits and costs of alternative power projects,1969,,"What are the conclusions that we have to draw from the foregoing discussion? We must conclude that the prevailing practice of evaluating benefits and costs in terms of present costs and prices is not only likely to lead to an under-statement of actual costs, but also may lead to gross inefficiencies in project selection. This danger is particularly great in cases of hydro projects with long construction time horizons or long-term project sequences that depend for their feasibility on some common facility. While the need to estimate future price relationships may seem to introduce new uncertainties into project evaluations the use of prevailing prices is even less satisfactory. A somewhat inaccurate estimate of future changes, as long as it points in the right direction and as long as it is backed up by a sensitivity analysis that tests the effects of the assumptions on overall benefits and costs will provide a better and more realistic picture. Today this issue is of particular urgency since the traditional cost advantage of hydro over thermal alternatives is quickly disappearing. Given the very dramatic cost reductions expected from the introduction of second and third generation atomic power plants it becomes mandatory for any power system planner to take these expected changes explicitly into account. © 1969 Annals of Regional Science.",,,Article
