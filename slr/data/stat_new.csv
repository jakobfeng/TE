"Zhao J.H., Dong Z.Y., Xu Z., Wong K.P.",A statistical approach for interval forecasting of the electricity price,2008,124,"Electricity price forecasting is a difficult yet essential task for market participants in a deregulated electricity market. Rather than forecasting the value, market participants are sometimes more interested in forecasting the prediction interval of the electricity price. Forecasting the prediction interval is essential for estimating the uncertainty involved in the price and thus is highly useful for making generation bidding strategies and investment decisions. In this paper, a novel data mining-based approach is proposed to achieve two major objectives: 1) to accurately forecast the value of the electricity price series, which is widely accepted as a nonlinear time series; 2) to accurately estimate the prediction interval of the electricity price series. In the proposed approach, support vector machine (SVM) is employed to forecast the value of the price. To forecast the prediction interval, we construct a statistical model by introducing a heteroscedastic variance equation for the SVM. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is used to estimate model parameters. Results from the case studies on real-world price data prove that the proposed method is highly effective compared with existing methods such as GARCH models. © 2008 IEEE.",Data mining; Electricity market price forecasting; Interval forecasting; Support vector machine,Data mining; Forecasting; Marketing; Maximum likelihood estimation; Operating costs; Support vector machines; Time series analysis; Electricity market price forecasting; Interval forecasting; Prediction interval; Electric industry,4,1,1,2,Article
"Bordignon S., Bunn D.W., Lisi F., Nan F.",Combining day-ahead forecasts for British electricity prices,2013,79,"This paper considers how well the approach of combining forecasts extends to the context of electricity prices. With the increasing popularity of regime switching and time-varying parameter models for predicting power prices, the multi model and evolutionary considerations that usually support the combining of simpler time series methods may be less applicable when the individual models incorporate these features. We address this question with a backtesting analysis on British day-ahead prices. Furthermore, given the volatility of power prices and concerns about accurate forecasting under extreme price excursions, we evaluate the results using various error metrics including expected shortfall. The comparisons are furthermore carefully simulated to consider model selection uncertainty in order to realistically test the value of combining as an ex ante policy. Overall, our results support combining for both accurate operational planning and risk management. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",ARMAX; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasts combination; Markov regime switching; Prediction accuracy; Time-varying parameter regression,ARMAX; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasts combination; Prediction accuracy; Regime switching; Time varying parameter; Electric load forecasting; Forecasting; Risk management; Time varying control systems; Costs; accuracy assessment; comparative study; electricity supply; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; forecasting method; Markov chain; model test; model validation; parameterization; risk assessment; time series analysis; United Kingdom,"3, 4",1,1,1,Article
"Zheng K., Wang Y., Liu K., Chen Q.",Locational Marginal Price Forecasting: A Componential and Ensemble Approach,2020,1,"Short-term locational marginal price (LMP) forecasting is the traditional problem of market participants and other institutions maximizing their profit. Most electricity market organizers in the world release the data of LMP along with its three components, i.e., the energy, congestion, and loss components. The series of the three components have their own patterns and driving factors, and can be utilized to improve the accuracy of LMP forecasting. However, most existing studies have focused on direct LMP forecasting and have barely noticed this characteristic. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between the released data of the three components and LMP forecasting through a componential and ensemble approach. Three individual forecasting models are selected and trained for these components, and an ensemble framework that stacks the summation LMP results and the direct results is proposed to enhance the overall accuracy and robustness. Numerical experiments with real market data are conducted to show the good performance of this novel approach. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",electricity market; Locational marginal price; model stacking%; short-term forecasting; tree-based regression,Power markets; Driving factors; Ensemble approaches; Forecasting models; Locational marginal price forecasting; Market participants; Numerical experiments; Overall accuracies; Three component; Forecasting,4,1,1,1,Article
"Zhou M., Yan Z., Ni Y.X., Li G., Nie Y.",Electricity price forecasting with confidence-interval estimation through an extended ARIMA approach,2006,74,"Accurate electricity price forecasting is a crucial issue concerned by market participants either for developing bidding strategies or for making investment decisions. Due to the complicated factors affecting electricity prices, accurate price forecasting turns out to be very difficult. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach has been extended to make hourly market clearing price (MCP) forecasting in electricity spot markets with error correction and confidence interval estimation. The ARIMA model used for forecasting price and the method to implement price forecasting are presented first. Then the ARIMA approach is extended to include error correction for improving accuracy of price forecasting. Moreover, the confidence interval of the forecasted prices is estimated assuming the residual errors are in gaussian or uniform distribution. Hourly MCP forecasting of the Californian Power Market is used as a computer example, and the comparison with conventional ARIMA approach is given. Computer test results show clearly that the suggested extended ARIMA approach for spot price forecasting is very effective with satisfactory accuracy. It can work under very worse market conditions with high price volatility.",,Decision making; Electricity; Error correction; Estimation; Investments; '; Bidding strategies; Electricity prices; Market clearing price (MCP); Electric load forecasting,4,1,1,2,Article
Serinaldi F.,"Distributional modeling and short-term forecasting of electricity prices by Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape",2011,47,"In the context of the liberalized and deregulated electricity markets, price forecasting has become increasingly important for energy company's plans and market strategies. Within the class of the time series models that are used to perform price forecasting, the subclasses of methods based on stochastic time series and causal models commonly provide point forecasts, whereas the corresponding uncertainty is quantified by approximate or simulation-based confidence intervals. Aiming to improve the uncertainty assessment, this study introduces the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) to model the dynamically varying distribution of prices. The GAMLSS allow fitting a variety of distributions whose parameters change according to covariates via a number of linear and nonlinear relationships. In this way, price periodicities, trends and abrupt changes characterizing both the position parameter (linked to the expected value of prices), and the scale and shape parameters (related to price volatility, skewness, and kurtosis) can be explicitly incorporated in the model setup. Relying on the past behavior of the prices and exogenous variables, the GAMLSS enable the short-term (one-day ahead) forecast of the entire distribution of prices. The approach was tested on two datasets from the widely studied California Power Exchange (CalPX) market, and the less mature Italian Power Exchange (IPEX). CalPX data allow comparing the GAMLSS forecasting performance with published results obtained by different models. The study points out that the GAMLSS framework can be a flexible alternative to several linear and nonlinear stochastic models. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity market price; GAMLSS models; Interval forecasting; Liberalized energy markets; Point forecasting,Electricity market; Energy markets; GAMLSS models; Interval forecasting; Point forecasting; Commerce; Computer simulation; Costs; Deregulation; Electricity; Forecasting; Statistical methods; Stochastic systems; Time series; Stochastic models; assessment method; commodity price; electricity generation; energy market; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; stochasticity; time series analysis; uncertainty analysis,4,1,1,2,Article
"Gulay E., Duru O.",Hybrid modeling in the predictive analytics of energy systems and prices,2020,,"The aim of this paper is to illustrate the nature of the residuals of a forecasting process and to propose a hybrid approach with linear and nonlinear components predicted by corresponding methodologies. It is a common practice that residuals are assumed to be unpredictable or are reiterated into a model as lagged variables to capture any information remaining in the residual data. The central argument of this paper is that residuals from energy price forecasting can still carry predictive information in its complex and nonlinear form. Although the linear modeling is initially very accurate, reiterating residuals in linear structures is a mismatch of data type and methodology. In this regard, the proposed algorithm hybridizes or combines linear components captured by the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) and nonlinear components processed by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve post-sample accuracy. The conventional reiterative process can improve in-sample accuracy, which literally has no value for business forecasting practices. Through a fair benchmark comparison, including methodologies of other combinations, the proposed algorithm is cross-validated by predictive accuracy gain in the out-of-sample (holdout) dataset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Combination forecasting; Energy markets; Energy prices; Price discovery; Price forecasting; Residual modeling,Costs; Forecasting; Neural networks; Signal processing; Autoregressive distributed lag models; Benchmark comparison; Business forecasting; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Linear components; Nonlinear components; Predictive accuracy; Predictive information; Predictive analytics; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial neural network; data set; energy market; forecasting method,"4, 5",2,1,1,Article
"Roungkvist J.S., Enevoldsen P., Xydis G.",High-resolution electricity spot price forecast for the danish power market,2020,1,"Energy markets with a high penetration of renewables are more likely to be challenged by price variations or volatility, which is partly due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy. The Danish electricity market (DK1) is a great example of such a market, as 49% of the power production in DK1 is based on wind power, conclusively challenging the electricity spot price forecast for the Danish power market. The energy industry and academia have tried to find the best practices for spot price forecasting in Denmark, by introducing everything from linear models to sophisticated machine-learning approaches. This paper presents a linear model for price forecasting-based on electricity consumption, thermal power production, wind production and previous electricity prices-to estimate long-term electricity prices in electricity markets with a high wind penetration levels, to help Utilities and asset owners to develop risk management strategies and for asset valuation. © 2020 by the authors.",Big data; Electricity spot price forecast; Power markets; Renewable energy; Wind power,academic research; best management practice; electricity generation; energy market; estimation method; machine learning; price dynamics; stochasticity; wind power; Denmark,4,2,1,1,Article
"Wang J., Yang W., Du P., Niu T.",Outlier-robust hybrid electricity price forecasting model for electricity market management,2020,5,"Electricity market management is of great importance for cleaner production in the development of society. However, despite this significance, electricity price forecasting remains a challenging task. Hybrid models are widely employed for forecasting electricity price, which has the characteristics of being non-stationarity, random, and non-linear. Despite their success, current hybrid models require improvement. In particular, data preprocessing, artificial intelligence optimization, feature selection, and basic forecasting engine selection should be considered. In this study, in addition to these issues, we consider the negative influence of outliers on the modeling of electricity price. In particular, a novel outlier-robust hybrid model is developed for forecasting electricity price, which combines a basic forecasting engine called outlier-robust extreme learning machine model and three new algorithms. Specifically, a new optimizer called chaotic sine cosine algorithm is developed to obtain the ideal parameters for phase space reconstruction, and then a novel feature selection method is developed to construct the optimal features in the modeling of electricity price. Moreover, an effective data preprocessing method is proposed for effective forecasting by capturing electricity price features. Subsequently, experiments based on electricity price data from the electricity markets of Australia and Singapore demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to other benchmark models. Further, the model can be a reliable forecasting method not only in electricity market management, but also in modeling time series with complex nonlinear characteristics and outliers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity market; Electricity price; Hybrid model; Multi-step forecasting,Commerce; Electric industry; Engines; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Machine learning; Phase space methods; Pollution control; Statistics; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Extreme learning machine; Feature selection methods; Hybrid model; Multi-step forecasting; Nonlinear characteristics; Phase space reconstruction; Power markets,"4, 5",2,1,1,Article
"Jónsson T., Pinson P., Madsen H., Nielsen H.A.",Predictive densities for day-ahead electricity prices using time-adaptive quantile regression,2014,32,"A large part of the decision-making problems actors of the power system are facing on a daily basis requires scenarios for day-ahead electricity market prices. These scenarios are most likely to be generated based on marginal predictive densities for such prices, then enhanced with a temporal dependence structure. A semi-parametric methodology for generating such densities is presented: it includes: (i) a time-adaptive quantile regression model for the 5%-95% quantiles; and (ii) a description of the distribution tails with exponential distributions. The forecasting skill of the proposed model is compared to that of four benchmark approaches and the well-known the generalist autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model over a three-year evaluation period. While all benchmarks are outperformed in terms of forecasting skill overall, the superiority of the semi-parametric model over the GARCH model lies in the former's ability to generate reliable quantile estimates. © 2014 by the authors.",Density forecasting; Electricity prices; Non-stationarity; Quantile regression; Stochastic processes,Costs; Decision making; Forecasting; Random processes; Regression analysis; Stochastic systems; Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Day-ahead electricity market; Density forecasting; Electricity prices; Exponential distributions; Non-stationarities; Quantile regression; Semi-parametric modeling; Power markets,4,1,1,2,Article
"Ziel F., Steinert R.",Electricity price forecasting using sale and purchase curves: The X-Model,2016,29,"Our paper aims to model and forecast the electricity price by taking a completely new perspective on the data. It will be the first approach which is able to combine the insights of market structure models with extensive and modern econometric analysis. Instead of directly modeling the electricity price as it is usually done in time series or data mining approaches, we model and utilize its true source: the sale and purchase curves of the electricity exchange. We will refer to this new model as X-Model, as almost every deregulated electricity price is simply the result of the intersection of the electricity supply and demand curve at a certain auction. Therefore we show an approach to deal with a tremendous amount of auction data, using a subtle data processing technique as well as dimension reduction and lasso based estimation methods. We incorporate not only several known features, such as seasonal behavior or the impact of other processes like renewable energy, but also completely new elaborated stylized facts of the bidding structure. Our model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of the electricity price, which is especially useful for predicting huge price spikes. Using simulation methods we show how to derive prediction intervals for probabilistic forecasting.

"Zhang J., Tan Z., Wei Y.",An adaptive hybrid model for short term electricity price forecasting,2020,8,"With the large-scale renewable energy integration into the power grid, the features of electricity price has become more complex, which makes the existing models hard to obtain a satisfactory results. Hence, more accurate and stable forecasting models need to be developed. In this paper, a new adaptive hybrid model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and deep belief network (DBN) is proposed for short term electricity price forecasting.

"Ziel F., Steinert R.",Probabilistic mid- and long-term electricity price forecasting,2018,27,"The liberalization of electricity markets and the development of renewable energy sources has led to new challenges for decision makers. These challenges are accompanied by an increasing uncertainty about future electricity price movements. The increasing amount of papers, which aim to model and predict electricity prices for a short period of time provided new opportunities for market participants. However, the electricity price literature seem to be very scarce on the issue of medium- to long-term price forecasting, which is mandatory for investment and political decisions. Our paper closes this gap by introducing a new approach to simulate electricity prices with hourly resolution for several months up to three years. Considering the uncertainty of future events we are able to provide probabilistic forecasts which are able to detect probabilities for price spikes even in the long-run. As market we decided to use the EPEX day-ahead electricity market for Germany and Austria. Our model extends the X-Model which mainly utilizes the sale and purchase curve for electricity day-ahead auctions. By applying our procedure we are able to give probabilities for the due to the EEG practical relevant event of six consecutive hours of negative prices. We find that using the supply and demand curve based model in the long-run yields realistic patterns for the time series of electricity prices and leads to promising results considering common error measures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity prices; Long-term; Negative prices; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energy; Supply and demand,Commerce; Costs; Curve fitting; Decision making; Forecasting; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Electricity prices; Long-term; Negative prices; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energies; Supply and demand; Power markets,4,"2, 3",1,2,Article
"McHugh C., Coleman S., Kerr D., McGlynn D.",Forecasting Day-ahead Electricity Prices with A SARIMAX Model,2019,,"Electricity prices display nonlinear behaviour making it difficult to forecast prices in the market. In addition, various external factors influence electricity prices therefore predicting the day-ahead electricity price is subject to other factors fluctuating. Time-series models learn to follow past market trends and then use historical information as training input to predict future output. This paper focusses on understanding and interpreting statistical approaches for electricity price forecasting and explains these techniques through time-series application with real energy data. The model considered here is a Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model with eXogenous variables (SARIMAX) as electricity prices follow a seasonal pattern controlled by various external factors. By applying algorithm rules for differencing to remove continuing trends, the data becomes stationary and parameters, 14 external factors, are chosen to predict day ahead electricity prices.

"Singh P.K., Singh N., Negi R.",Short-Term Price Forecasting with Renewable Integration in Smart Grids Using ARIMA-ANN-ANFIS Hybrid Model,2019,,"The load and price forecasting are two main problems in the electricity markets, but the consumers should be able to react to the electricity prices and handle their electricity utilization. The wind power penetration in smart grids has become highly complex in real time matching of the electricity consumption and production in the power systems due to its high variability. Thus, it is of great importance to achieve short-term prediction of electricity price accurately. In this paper, taking high wind power penetration and Nord Pool power market into concern, authors proposed a hybrid ARIMA-ANN-ANFIS model to forecast daily price for each month from January to April 2014. The performance of the proposed model has been evaluated in terms of MAE, MAPE, RMSE and variance.

"Johannesen N.J., Kolhe M., Goodwin M.",Deregulated Electric Energy Price Forecasting in NordPool Market using Regression Techniques,2019,,"Deregulated electricity market day-ahead electrical energy price forecasting is important. It is influenced by external parameters and it is a complicated function. In this work two neighboring regions in the NordPool market are analyzed to provide day-ahead electrical price forecasting using regression techniques. The characteristics of the NordPool market trading behavior leads to unanticipated price peaks at daily, weekly and annual level. The considered two Nordic regions have different energy generation sources (e.g Norway has controllable hydro power, Denmark has non-controllable wind-power) therefore day-ahead electrical energy price forecasting in deregulated market for these two neighboring countries can impact the energy generation dynamics. Due to the dynamics of the electricity markets and region divisions this work proposes electric energy price forecasting using regression tools based in the k-Nearest Neighbor regressor, to capture the small increments in changing price behavior, and an autoregressor on top to capture the finite gradient of the occasional spikes in the price cycles. The electric energy price forecasting analysis of these two regions have shown that there is much more accurate forecasting in the Norwegian market compared to Danish market. To improve the forecasting in Danish market impact of external parameters (e.g meteorological parameters) should be considered for improving the forecasting. © 2019 IEEE.",Autoregression; Electrical energy price forecasting; Energy Markets; Machine Learning,Deregulation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric tools; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Regression analysis; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Autoregression; Complicated functions; Deregulated electricity market; Deregulated markets; Electrical energy; Energy markets; Meteorological parameters; Regression techniques; Power markets,4,1,1,1,Conference
"Radovanovic A., Nesti T., Chen B.",A Holistic Approach to Forecasting Wholesale Energy Market Prices,2019,1,"Electricity market price predictions enable energy market participants to shape their consumption or supply while meeting their economic and environmental objectives. By utilizing the basic properties of the supply-demand matching process performed by grid operators, known as optimal power flow (OPF), we develop a methodology to recover energy market's structure and predict the resulting nodal prices by using only publicly available data, specifically grid-wide generation type mix, system load, and historical prices. Our methodology uses the latest advancements in statistical learning to cope with high-dimensional and sparse real power grid topologies, as well as scarce, public market data, while exploiting structural characteristics of the underlying OPF mechanism. Rigorous validations using the Southwest power pool market data reveal strong correlation between the grid level mix and corresponding market prices, resulting in accurate day-ahead predictions of real-time prices. The proposed approach demonstrates a remarkable proximity to the state-of-the-art industry benchmark, while assuming a fully decentralized, market-participant perspective.

"Mujeeb S., Javaid N.",ESAENARX and DE-RELM: Novel schemes for big data predictive analytics of electricity load and price,2019,12,"Accurate forecasting of the electricity price and load is an essential and challenging task in smart grids. Since electricity load and price have a strong correlation, the forecast accuracy degrades when bidirectional relation of price and load is not considered. Therefore, this paper considers price and load relationship and proposes two Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs (MIMO) Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNNs) models for price and load forecasting. The first proposed model, Efficient Sparse Autoencoder Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with eXogenous inputs (ESAENARX) comprises of feature engineering and forecasting. For feature engineering, we propose ESAE and performed forecasting using existing method NARX.

The descriptive and predictive analyses are performed on two well-known electricity markets’ big data, i.e., ISO NE and PJM. The proposed models outperform their sub models and a benchmark model. The refined and informative features extracted by ESAE improve the forecasting accuracy in ESANARX and optimization improves the DE-RELM's accuracy.

However, this framework is based on linear models estimated using ordinary least squares. This paper shows that considering non-linear autoregressive (NARX) neural network-type models with the same inputs as the corresponding SCAR-type models can lead to yet better performances. While individual Seasonal Component Artificial Neural Network (SCANN) models are generally worse than the corresponding SCAR-type structures, we provide empirical evidence that committee machines of SCANN networks can outperform the latter significantly. © 2017 International Institute of Forecasters",Committee machine; Day-ahead market; Electricity spot price; Forecasting; Long-term seasonal component; NARX neural network,,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article
Poyrazoglu G.,Price Estimation by Random Walk Mean Reversion in Day-ahead Electricity Market,2019,,"The fluctuations in the Day-ahead electricity market (DAM) prices generally follow the periodic demand variance.

In this paper, a novel hybrid method, with using empirical wavelet transform (EWT), support vector regression (SVR), Bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and Bayesian optimization (BO), is proposed to increase the accuracy of electricity price forecasting. First, EWT is used as a processing tool to decompose the original signal into specific modal components according to the characteristics of the signal itself. Then, considering the complexity of forecasting nonlinear subseries, SVR and BiLSTM are used as basic framework to forecast the nonlinear subseries. At the same time, BO is introduced to adjust parameters and optimize model performance. In last, the final prediction results are combined by the prediction results of different models. The proposed hybrid model is employed on the data gathered from the European Power Exchange Spot (EPEXSPOT).

There are particularities in the case of the Mexican market, the main one being the gradual increase in the number of competitors observed until now and, on the other hand, the geographic and technical characteristics of the electric power generation. The observed prices to date show great fluctuations in the observed data due to diverse aspects; among the stems we can mention the own seasonality of the demand of electrical energy, the availability of fuel, the problems of congestion in the electrical network, as well as other risks such as natural hazards. For the above, it is relevant in a market context to have a price estimation as accurate as possible for the decision-making of supply and demand.

"Yousefi A., Sianaki O.A., Sharafi D.",Long-Term Electricity Price Forecast Using Machine Learning Techniques,2019,,"Predicting the performance of energy commodities has long been a global priority for researchers and investors in the Energy sector. Large green field and brown field projects (often exceeding 1bn USD) are financed with locked in capital from the start, and typically take decades to return. Despite being one of the most important aspects of investment decision making, the prediction methodologies used widely today are not sophisticated enough to provide accurate insights for the investors. The new approach was proposed in this research to provide data analytics backed analysis for the performance of energy related commodities using innovative feature discovery methods and machine learning tools. In the presented research, a machine learning model was trained to predict the average monthly price of electricity in the next 5 years with focus on the California State energy market. Data points from 2001 to 2017 were collected and 78 data points are considered for analyses to select the highly-correlated features which could potentially affect the electricity price in the medium to long term. An economic case study is undertaken to understand the correlation of the features, and to avoid multicollinearity. In the next step, the selected features are applied into an S-ARIMA time series prediction algorithm. In addition, several feature-based machine learning algorithms are applied to the data and the results analysed and compared to find the effective forcasting approach. The findings demonstrated promising results for three years future price prediction horizon. Further studies are required to get more accurate electricity results beyond three years horizon. © 2019 IEEE.",Clustering; Energy Price Prediction; Feature Correlation Analysis; Machine Learning Algorithms; Random Forests; Time Series Analysis,Clustering algorithms; Data Analytics; Decision making; Decision trees; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Investments; Learning systems; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Smart power grids; Time series analysis; Clustering; Energy prices; Feature correlation; Investment decision making; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Prediction methodology; Random forests; Learning algorithms,"4, 5",3,1,1,Conference
"Bello A., Bunn D.W., Reneses J., Munoz A.",Medium-Term Probabilistic Forecasting of Electricity Prices: A Hybrid Approach,2017,22,"This paper provides a focus upon forecasting electricity prices in the medium term (from a few weeks to several months ahead) in which accurate estimates of tail risks, e.g., at the 1%, 5%, 95%, and 99%, are important. Medium term forecasting and risk analysis are important for operational scheduling, fuel purchasing, trading, and profit management. We extend the research on hybrid forecasting methods, which link detailed fundamental price formation models, using optimization techniques and market equilibrium considerations, with econometric recalibration to the time series data. This paper is innovative in its use of quantile regression to undertake the recalibration and provide accurate risk estimates. It is shown that probabilistic outputs from the fundamental model add value over expected value inputs to the quantile regressions and that if the fundamental model is itself well specified to diurnal variation through the inclusion of relevant explanatory variables such as demand or climatic conditions, then it is not necessary to undertake the quantile regressions separately for each hour of the day. A real application of the proposed methodology is successfully tested on the Spanish electric power system, in which the high penetration of intermittent wind generation creates extreme price risks. The hybrid method outperforms the more conventional fundamental model, making particular use of wind generation data in the quantile recalibrations. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Electricity prices; fundamentals; hybrid model; probabilistic forecasting; quantile regression,Commerce; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Scheduling; Electricity prices; fundamentals; Hybrid model; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile regression; Costs,4,2,1,2,Article
"Grossi L., Nan F.","Robust forecasting of electricity prices: Simulations, models and the impact of renewable sources",2019,7,"In this paper a robust approach to modeling electricity spot prices is introduced. Differently from what has been recently done in the literature on electricity price forecasting, where the attention has been mainly drawn by the prediction of spikes, the focus of this contribution is on the robust estimation of nonlinear SETARX models (Self-Exciting Threshold Auto Regressive models with eXogenous regressors). In this way, parameter estimates are not, or very lightly, influenced by the presence of extreme observations and the large majority of prices, which are not spikes, could be better forecasted. A Monte Carlo study is carried out in order to select the best weighting function for Generalized M-estimators of SETAR processes. A robust procedure to select and estimate nonlinear processes for electricity prices is introduced, including robust tests for stationarity and nonlinearity and robust information criteria. The application of the procedure to the Italian electricity market reveals the forecasting superiority of the robust GM-estimator based on the polynomial weighting function with respect to the non-robust Least Squares estimator. Finally, the introduction of generation from renewable sources in the robust estimation of SETARX processes contributes to the improvement of the forecasting ability of the model. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Electricity price; Nonlinear time series; Price forecasting; Robust GM-estimator; Spikes; Threshold models,Forecasting; Power markets; Time series analysis; Electricity prices; Nonlinear time series; Price forecasting; Robust GM-estimator; Spikes; Threshold model; Cost estimating; computer simulation; electricity generation; energy market; estimation method; forecasting method; nonlinearity; numerical model; renewable resource; time series analysis; Italy,4,1,1,1,Article
"Maciejowska K., Nitka W., Weron T.",Day-ahead vs. Intraday—Forecasting the price spread to maximize economic benefits,2019,17,"Recently, a dynamic development of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) has been observed. In order to allow for the adoption of trading contracts for unplanned events and changing weather conditions, the day-ahead markets have been complemented by intraday markets; in some countries, such as Poland, balancing markets are used for this purpose. This research focuses on a small RES generator, which has no market power and sells electricity through a larger trading company. The generator needs to decide, in advance, how much electricity is sold in the day-ahead market. The optimal decision of the generator on where to sell the production depends on the relation between prices in different markets. Unfortunately, when making the decision, the generator is not sure which market will offer a higher price. This article investigates the possible gains from utilizing forecasts of the price spread between the intraday/balancing and day-ahead markets in the decision process. It shows that the sign of the price spread can be successfully predicted with econometric models, such as ARX and probit. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the statistical measures of forecast accuracy, such as the percentage of correct sign classifications, do not necessarily coincide with economic benefits. © 2019 by the authors.",ARX model; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Forecasting; Price spread; Probit model,Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Renewable energy resources; ARX model; Dynamic development; Electricity prices; Forecast accuracy; Price spread; Probit models; Renewable energy source; Statistical measures; Power markets,4,1,"1, 2",1,Article
"Cerjan M., Petričić A., Delimar M.",HIRA model for short-term electricity price forecasting,2019,3,"In competitive power markets, electric utilities, power producers, and traders are exposed to increased risks caused by electricity price volatility. The growing reliance on renewable sources and their dependence on weather, nuclear uncertainty, market coupling, and global financial instability are contributing to the importance of accurate electricity price forecasting. Since power markets are not all equally developed, different price forecasting methods have been introduced for individual markets. The aim of this research is to introduce a short-term electricity price forecasting method that addresses the problems of price volatility, a varying number of input parameters, varying data availability, and a large number of parameters and input data. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used on any market as it targets the characteristics and specifics of each market. The proposed Hybrid Iterative Reactive Adaptive (HIRA) method consists of two phases. In analysis phase, fundamental parameters which affect the electricity price are identified depending on market development. Obtained parameters are used as data inputs for price forecasting using a hybrid method. The HIRA model combines a statistical approach for large data set analysis and a similar day method with neural network tools. Similar days are examined using a statistical method which combines correlation significance, price volatility, and forecasting accuracy of the historical data. Data are collected based on their availability and electricity prices are forecasted in several iterations. All relevant data for price forecasting are collected, categorized, and arranged using simple indicators which makes the HIRA model adaptive and reactive to new market circumstances. The proposed model is validated using the Hungarian Power Exchange (HUPX) electricity price data records. The results show that with HIRA model forecasting, the error is stable and does not depend on price volatility. The HIRA method has proven to be applicable for forecasting electricity prices in real-time market conditions and enables effective hedging of price risk in the production or market portfolio. © 2019 by the authors.",Data mining; Dynamic hybrid model; Electricity market; Electricity price; Neural network; Short-term electricity price forecast; Spot market,Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Electric utilities; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Competitive power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price volatilities; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Hybrid model; Spot market; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article
"Campos V., Osorio G., Shafie-Khah M., Lotfi M., Catalao J.P.S.",Short-Term Hybrid Probabilistic Forecasting Model for Electricity Market Prices,2019,,"With the integration of new power production technologies and the growing focus on dispersed production, there has been a paradigm change in the electricity sector, mostly under a renewable and sustainable way. Consequentially, challenges for profitability as well as correct management of the electricity sector have increased its complexity. The use of forecasting tools that allow a real and robust approach makes it possible to improve system operation and thus minimizing costs associated with the activities of the electric sector. Hence, the forecasting approaches have an essential role in all stages of the electricity markets. In this paper, a hybrid probabilistic forecasting model (HPFM) was developed for short-term electricity market prices (EMP), combining Wavelet Transform (WT), hybrid particle swarm optimization (DEEPSO), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), together with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The proposed HPFM was tested and validated with real data from the Spanish and Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) markets, considering the next week ahead.

However, due to the complex drivers and sharp fluctuation of electricity prices, accurate electricity price forecasting turns to be very difficult. To better capture the characteristics of day-ahead electricity prices, a new integrated model based on the improved empirical mode decomposition (IEMD), autoregressive moving average with exogenous terms (ARMAX), exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (EGARCH) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed in this paper. Then it is validated by using the data from Spanish and Australian electricity markets.

"Wang F., Li K., Zhou L., Ren H., Contreras J., Shafie-khah M., Catalão J.P.S.",Daily pattern prediction based classification modeling approach for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2019,48,"Day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) plays a very important role in the decision-making optimization of electricity market participants, the dispatch control of independent system operators (ISOs) and the strategy formulation of energy trading. Unified modeling that only fits a single mapping relation between the historical data and future data usually produces larger errors because the different fluctuation patterns in electricity price data show different mapping relations. A daily pattern prediction (DPP) based classification modeling approach for DAEPF is proposed to solve this problem. The basic idea is that first recognize the price pattern of the next day from the “rough” day-ahead forecasting results provided by conventional forecasting methods and then perform classification modeling to further improve the forecasting accuracy through building a specific forecasting model for each pattern. The proposed approach consists of four steps. First, K-means is utilized to group all the historical daily electricity price curves into several clusters in order to assign each daily curve a pattern label for the training of the following daily pattern recognition (DPR) model and classification modeling. Second, a DPP model is proposed to recognize the price pattern of the next day from the forecasting results provided by multiple conventional forecasting methods. A weighted voting mechanism (WVM) method is proposed in this step to combine multiple day-ahead pattern predictions to obtain a more accurate DPP result. Third, the classification forecasting model of each different daily pattern can be established according to the clustering results in step 1. Fourth, the credibility of DPP result is checked to eventually determine whether the proposed classification DAEPF modeling approach can be adopted or not. A case study using the real electricity price data from the PJM market indicates that the proposed approach presents a better performance than unified modeling for a certain daily pattern whose DPP results show high reliability and accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Classification modeling; Daily pattern prediction; Day-ahead forecasting; Electricity price; Weighted voting mechanism,Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Decision making; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Mapping; Pattern recognition; Classification models; Day-ahead; Decision-making optimization; Different mapping relation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Independent system operators; Weighted voting; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article
"McHugh C., Coleman S., Kerr D., McGlynn D.",A Linear Polynomial NARMAX Model with Multiple Factors to Forecast Day-Ahead Electricity Prices,2019,1,"Forecasting algorithms are a valuable mechanism to aid in the prediction of future prices. Although various black-box modelling techniques have been applied to variations of this problem, we focus on the use of transparent models to enable understanding and interpretation of the developed model. We utilize a Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous input(NARMAX) for electricity price forecasting using multiple input factors. Energy data from a 14-week period in 2017 were analyzed to determine whether a NARMAX model could accurately predict day-ahead electricity prices and to check which input factors in the model were most significant. The model considered the closely correlated lags and included 13 input factors. There were two models developed in order to determine which variables played an important role in predicting future prices. Experimental results indicate that previous price, demand, gas, coal, and nuclear are the most significant factors that influence electricity prices. Gas was the highest weighted factor for both developed models. Previous price yielded the biggest Error Reduction Ratio(ERR), but when not included in the model, demand generated the biggest ERR value. To summarize a NARMAX model with an input regression lag of one and previous price included generates the best day-ahead forecast of electricity prices. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Energy market; Multiple factors; NARMAX,Artificial intelligence; Composite structures; Costs; Forecasting; Black box modelling; Electricity price forecasting; Energy markets; Error reduction ratios; Forecasting algorithm; Multiple factors; NARMAX; Nonlinear autoregressive moving average models; Power markets,4,1,1,1,Conference

"Karabiber O.A., Xydis G.","Electricity price forecasting in the Danish day-ahead market using the TBATS, ANN and ARIMA methods",2019,11,"In this paper day-ahead electricity price forecasting for the Denmark-West region is realized with a 24 h forecasting range. The forecasting is done for 212 days from the beginning of 2017 and past data from 2016 is used. For forecasting, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Trigonometric Seasonal Box-Cox Transformation with ARMA residuals Trend and Seasonal Components (TBATS) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods are used and seasonal naïve forecast is utilized as a benchmark. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are used as accuracy criterions. ARIMA and ANN are utilized with external variables and variable analysis is realized in order to improve forecasting results. As a result of variable analysis, it was observed that excluding temperature from external variables helped improve forecasting results. In terms of mean error ARIMA yielded the best results while ANN had the lowest minimum error and standard deviation. TBATS performed better than ANN in terms of mean error. To further improve forecasting accuracy, the three forecasts were combined using simple averaging and ANN methods and they were both found to be beneficial, with simple averaging having better accuracy. Overall, this paper demonstrates a solid forecasting methodology, while showing actual forecasting results and improvements for different forecasting methods. © 2019 by the authors.",ARIMA; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combination; Neural network,Commerce; Errors; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; ARIMA; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Box Cox transformation; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combinations; Forecasting accuracy; Root mean squared errors; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article

Our hybrid methodology consists into two steps. The first step aims at modeling the conditional mean of the time series, using a generalized fractional model with k-factor of Gegenbauer termed the k-factor GARMA model; the parameters of this model are estimated using the wavelet approach based on the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT). The second step aims at estimating the conditional variance, so we adopt the local linear wavelet neural network (LLWNN) model. The proposed hybrid model is tested using the hourly log-returns of electricity spot price from the Nord Pool market. The empirical results were compared with the predictions of the ARFIMA–LLWNN, the k-factor GARMA–FIGARCH and the individual LLWNN models.

"Varshney H., Sujil A., Kumar R.",A Singular Spectrum Analysis based Approach to Price Forecasting for a Day Ahead Electricity Market,2018,1,"Deregulation across various electricity markets created a need for an operational framework that has capability to run similar to the dynamics of real world commodity markets possessing the competitiveness to ensure long run stability, providing opportunity to every participant and maintaining the price level of commodity within the reach of consumer. The electricity framework takes into account the power system balancing constraints required to ensure its reliability and security. This complex structure with its aim of competitiveness motivated the participating entities to run the generating capacities at the optimum level, forced the operators to minimize the transmission losses and created an environment for the consumers to take the benefit of variable pricing conditions. Specially, these effects are reflected via short term electricity price forecasting (STPF) in a significant amount. The STPF created the required decision base for the entities to bid in market with an effective strategy of risk management to hedge against the highly volatile pricing events to ensure the required amount of liquidity and making better economic conditions while in case of large consumers, it helps to either curtail or schedule the loads to minimize the cost of energy. It also helps them to prepare an alternative strategy to make available the required energy via small private generating units during peak price hours. To account for different requirements of various entities, accurate price forecasting is a crucial task. The complexity of the price dynamics also involves the variations attributed to spatial effects in different operating regions such as calamities and extreme conditions. In this paper, Singular Spectrum Analysis based model is used to forecast the price.

A Gaussian Kernel Density Estimator function is used for each input variable, which allows to calculate the parameters of the probability density function (PDF) of a Beta distribution for the hourly price variable. Thus, valuable information is obtained from PDFs such as point forecasts, variance values, quantiles, probabilities of prices, and time series representations of forecast uncertainty. A Reliability Indicator is also introduced to give a measure of “reliability” of forecasts. The Probabilistic Price Forecasting Models were satisfactorily applied to the real-world case study of the Iberian Electricity Market. Input variables of these models include recent prices, power demands and power generations in the previous day, power demands in the previous week, forecasts of demand, wind power generation and weather for the day-ahead, and chronological data. The best model, corresponding to the best combination of input variables that achieves the lowest MAE, obtains one of the highest Reliability Indicator values.

Over the traditional GM(0, N) model, three major improvements of the proposed model are: (i) the lower and upper bounds are firstly identified to give an interval estimation of the forecasting value; (ii) a novel whitenization method is then established to determine the definite forecasting value from the forecasting interval; and (iii) the model parameters are identified by an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) instead of the least square method (LSM) for the limitation of LSM. Finally, a newly-reformed electricity market in Yunnan province of China is studied, and input variables are contrapuntally selected. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by observed data. Compared with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, the traditional GM(0, N) model and the artificial neural network (ANN) model, the proposed model gives a better performance and its superiority is further ensured by the use of the modified Diebold-Mariano (MDM) test, suggesting that it is suitable for mid-term electricity MCP forecasting in a data-sparse electricity market. © 2016 by the authors.",Grey prediction model; Market clearing price (MCP); Mid-term; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sparse data,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Linear regression; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); System theory; Artificial neural network models; Grey prediction model; Lower and upper bounds; Market Clearing Price; Market clearing prices; Mid-term; Multiple linear regression models; Sparse data; Power markets,4,2,1,2,Article
"Ziel F., Weron R.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting with high-dimensional structures: Univariate vs. multivariate modeling frameworks,2018,50,"We conduct an extensive empirical study on short-term electricity price forecasting (EPF) to address the long-standing question if the optimal model structure for EPF is univariate or multivariate. We provide evidence that despite a minor edge in predictive performance overall, the multivariate modeling framework does not uniformly outperform the univariate one across all 12 considered datasets, seasons of the year or hours of the day, and at times is outperformed by the latter. This is an indication that combining advanced structures or the corresponding forecasts from both modeling approaches can bring a further improvement in forecasting accuracy. We show that this indeed can be the case, even for a simple averaging scheme involving only two models.

"Zhao Z., Wang C., Nokleby M., Miller C.J.",Improving short-term electricity price forecasting using day-ahead LMP with ARIMA models,2018,2,"Short-term electricity price forecasting has become important for demand side management and power generation scheduling. Especially as the electricity market is becomes more competitive, a more accurate price prediction than the day-ahead locational marginal price (DALMP) published by the independent system operator (ISO) will benefit participants in the market by increasing profit or improving load demand scheduling. Hence, the main idea of this paper is to use autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to obtain a better LMP prediction than the DALMP by utilizing the published DALMP, historical real-time LMP (RTLMP) and other useful information. First, a set of seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models utilizing the DALMP and historical RTLMP are developed and compared with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models that use the differences between DALMP and RTLMP on their forecasting capability. A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is implemented to further improve the forecasting by accounting for the price volatility. The models are trained and evaluated using real market data in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region. The evaluation results indicate that the ARMAX-GARCH model, where an exogenous time series indicates weekend days, improves the short-term electricity price prediction accuracy and outperforms the other proposed ARIMA models. © 2017 IEEE.",ARIMA models; Electricity market; Locational marginal price; Price prediction,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Scheduling; ARIMA models; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Autoregressive moving average model; Electricity price forecasting; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Independent system operators; Locational marginal prices; Price prediction; Power markets,4,1,1,1,Conference

Smart grids use ancillary services & demand response programs to manage any demand fluctuations. Independent System Operators (ISOs) & Regional Transmission Organisations (RTO) are responsible for keeping the grid balanced with generation & load. Power Grid Corporation (ISO), Indian Energy Exchange (ISO) & Kerala State Electricity Board (RTO) are the key players who perform this function for Kerala region. IEX manage the energy markets by operating three submarkets day-ahead, real-time& capacity markets. Through day-ahead market, electricity generators &load-serving entities submit their bids to receive & offer electricity to the power grid based on varying cost on each hour for the next operating day. In the real-time market, ISO & RTOs manage these changes in production & consumption throughout the day. They optimize the generation dispatch schedule where they consider generation cost & transmission constraints. Capacity markets are employed to have study flow of capital investments in the market thereby increasing the generation capacity. Currently, KSEB forecast & schedule power generation to ensure sufficient power is available at its disposal for transmission. But with generation capacity standing at a mere 30% of demand, it has to depend upon bulk purchases. To bring transparency to KSEB’s procurement programme, the Kerala state regulatory commission (erc Kerala) have provided adequate guidelines to consider commodity markets as well along with its traditional flat-ratecontracts. On this research study, we are forecasting day-ahead electricity spot price at IEX Kerala region using modern electrometric techniques. The time series analysis of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is applied to the historical IEX spot price data starting from 1st February 2017 to 31st January of 2018. In every deregulated electricity market, it’s a practice to perform the price forecasting first and then to prepare the bids accordingly. KSEB can also apply this technique to improve their procurement efficiency. From 2017 onwards, IEX has created a new separate bid region for the Kerala market, making Kerala specific market study very relevant. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

"Uniejewski B., Weron R.",Efficient forecasting of electricity spot prices with expert and LASSO models,2018,9,"Recent electricity price forecasting (EPF) studies suggest that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) leads to well performing models that are generally better than those obtained from other variable selection schemes. By conducting an empirical study involving datasets from two major power markets (Nord Pool and PJM Interconnection), three expert models, two multi-parameter regression (called baseline) models and four variance stabilizing transformations combined with the seasonal component approach, we discuss the optimal way of implementing the LASSO. We show that using a complex baseline model with nearly 400 explanatory variables, a well chosen variance stabilizing transformation (asinh or N-PIT), and a procedure that recalibrates the LASSO regularization parameter once or twice a day indeed leads to significant accuracy gains compared to the typically considered EPF models. Moreover, by analyzing the structures of the best LASSO-estimated models, we identify the most important explanatory variables and thus provide guidelines to structuring better performing models. © 2018 MDPI AG.

In this paper we try to incorporate this uncertainty in the electricity price forecasting model by applying interval numbers to express the price of electricity, with no intention of exploring influencing factors. This paper represents a hybrid model based on fuzzy C-mean clustering and the interval-valued autoregressive process for forecasting the short-term electricity price. A fuzzy C-mean algorithm was used to create interval time series to be forecasted by the interval autoregressive process. In this way, the efficiency of forecasting is improved because we predict the interval, not the crisp value where the price will be.

"Carpio J., Juan J., López D.",Multivariate exponential smoothing and dynamic factor model applied to hourly electricity price analysis,2014,9,"Thanks to its very simple recursive computing scheme, exponential smoothing has become a popular technique to forecast time series. In this work, we show the advantages of its multivariate version and present some properties of the model, which allows us to perform a dynamic factor analysis. This analysis leads to a simple methodology to reduce the number of parameters (useful when the dimension of observations is large) via a linear transformation that decomposes the multivariate process into independent univariate exponential smoothing processes, characterized by a single smoothing parameter that goes from zero (white-noise process) to one (random walk process). A computer implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm has been built for the maximum likelihood estimation of the models. The practicality of the method is demonstrated by its application to hourly electricity price predictions in some day-ahead markets, such as Omel, Powernext, and Nord Pool markets, whose forecasts are given as examples.

"González J.P., Roque A.M.S., Pérez E.A.",Forecasting functional time series with a new hilbertian ARMAX model: Application to electricity price forecasting,2018,38,"A functional time series is the realization of a stochastic process where each observation is a continuous function defined on a finite interval. These processes are commonly found in electricity markets and are gaining more importance as more market data become available and markets head toward continuous-time marginal pricing approaches. Forecasting these time series requires models that operate with continuous functions. This paper proposes a new functional forecasting method that attempts to generalize the standard seasonal ARMAX time series model to the L2 Hilbert space. The structure of the proposed model is a linear regression where functional parameters operate on functional variables. The variables can be lagged values of the series (autoregressive terms), past observed innovations (moving average terms), or exogenous variables. In this approach, the functional parameters used are integral operators whose kernels are modeled as linear combinations of sigmoid functions. The parameters of each sigmoid are optimized using a Quasi-Newton algorithm that minimizes the sum of squared errors. This novel approach allows us to estimate the moving average terms in functional time series models. The new model is tested by forecasting the daily price profile of the Spanish and German electricity markets and it is compared to other functional reference models. © 2017 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Functional ARMAX model; Functional data analysis; Functional time series,Commerce; Continuous time systems; Costs; Forecasting; Functions; Power markets; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Time series; ARMAX model; Electricity price forecasting; Functional data analysis; Functional forecasting; Functional parameters; Functional time series; Quasi-newton algorithm; Sum of squared errors; Time series analysis,4,1,1,1,Article
"Talari S., Shafie-khah M., Osório G.J., Wang F., Heidari A., Catalão J.P.S.",Price forecasting of electricity markets in the presence of a high penetration of wind power generators,2017,4,"Price forecasting plays a vital role in the day-ahead markets. Once sellers and buyers access an accurate price forecasting, managing the economic risk can be conducted appropriately through offering or bidding suitable prices. In networks with high wind power penetration, the electricity price is influenced by wind energy; therefore, price forecasting can be more complicated. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for price forecasting of day-ahead markets, with high penetration of wind generators based on Wavelet transform, bivariate Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN). To this end, a weighted time series for wind dominated power systems is calculated and added to a bivariate ARIMA model along with the price time series. Moreover, RBFN is applied as a tool to correct the estimation error, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the structure and adapt the RBFN to the particular training set. This method is evaluated on the Spanish electricity market, which shows the efficiency of this approach. This method has less error compared with other methods especially when it considers the effects of large-scale wind generators. © 2017 by the authors.",Bivariate ARIMA; Hybrid method; Price forecasting; Wavelet transform; Wind generator,accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; economic analysis; electricity industry; optimization; power generation; price dynamics; wavelet analysis; wind power,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article
"Andrade J.R., Filipe J., Reis M., Bessa R.J.",Probabilistic price forecasting for day-ahead and intraday markets: Beyond the statistical model,2017,20,"Forecasting the hourly spot price of day-ahead and intraday markets is particularly challenging in electric power systems characterized by high installed capacity of renewable energy technologies. In particular, periods with low and high price levels are difficult to predict due to a limited number of representative cases in the historical dataset, which leads to forecast bias problems and wide forecast intervals. Moreover, these markets also require the inclusion of multiple explanatory variables, which increases the complexity of the model without guaranteeing a forecasting skill improvement. This paper explores information from daily futures contract trading and forecast of the daily average spot price to correct point and probabilistic forecasting bias. It also shows that an adequate choice of explanatory variables and use of simple models like linear quantile regression can lead to highly accurate spot price point and probabilistic forecasts. In terms of point forecast, the mean absolute error was 3.03 €/MWh for day-ahead market and a maximum value of 2.53 €/MWh was obtained for intraday session 6. The probabilistic forecast results show sharp forecast intervals and deviations from perfect calibration below 7% for all market sessions. © 2017 by the authors.",Electricity market; Feature engineering; Intraday; Price forecasting; Statistical learning; Uncertainty,complexity; electrical power; energy market; energy resource; market conditions; numerical model; price dynamics; renewable resource; statistical analysis; uncertainty analysis,"4, 5",1,"1, 2",2,Article
"Pircalabu A., Benth F.E.",A regime-switching copula approach to modeling day-ahead prices in coupled electricity markets,2017,10,"The recent price coupling of many European electricity markets has triggered a fundamental change in the interaction of day-ahead prices, challenging additionally the modeling of the joint behavior of prices in interconnected markets. In this paper we propose a regime-switching AR–GARCH copula to model pairs of day-ahead electricity prices in coupled European markets. While capturing key stylized facts empirically substantiated in the literature, this model easily allows us to 1) deviate from the assumption of normal margins and 2) include a more detailed description of the dependence between prices. We base our empirical study on four pairs of prices, namely Germany–France, Germany–Netherlands, Netherlands–Belgium and Germany–Western Denmark. We find that the marginal dynamics are better described by the flexible skew t distribution than the benchmark normal distribution. Also, we find significant evidence of tail dependence in all pairs of interconnected areas we consider. As a first application of the proposed model, we consider the pricing of financial transmission rights, and highlight how the choice of marginal distributions and copula impacts prices. As a second application we consider the forecasting of tail quantiles, and evaluate the out-of-sample performance of competing models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Copula models; Day-ahead electricity prices; Financial transmission rights; Market coupling; Tail dependence; Tail quantile forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Normal distribution; Copula models; Electricity prices; Financial transmission right; Market coupling; Tail dependence; Power markets; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; modeling; performance assessment; price dynamics; Belgium; Denmark; France; Germany; Netherlands,"3, 4",1,1,1,Article
"Saâdaoui F., Mrad M.",Stochastic modelling of the price-volume relationship in electricity markets: Evidence from the Nordic energy exchange,2017,1,"The analysis of the interactions between price and transaction volume, conducted as part of a financial market, is one of the central themes of the financial theory. However, with the emergence of power exchanges and despite the expansion of the research sphere in this context, this issue had not been sufficiently addressed. This is due to not only the lack of concepts in theory but also to the peculiarity of price dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the nature of the relationship between price changes and trading volume in the Nordic power market (Nord Pool), which is one of the largest energy markets worldwide. Through statistical timing analysis of the price-volume covariation, we reconsider this joint modelling, but only settling for daily observations, which makes the specificity of this work. Contrary to most comparable works, which were based on high frequency data, we chose to omit intraday observations to circumvent the repercussion of the daily seasonality on one side and ensure more lucidity and clairvoyance to a wider horizon on the other. The empirical results go in line with our expectations and provide support for the claim that there exists a significant reciprocal causality between prices and trading volume.

"Gupta S., Chitkara P.",Day ahead price forecasting models in thin electricity market,2017,2,"Day Ahead Electricity Markets (DAMs) in India are thin but growing. Consistent price forecasts are important for their utilization in portfolio optimization models.

Drivers of demand and supply include weather variations over large geographic areas, outages of power system elements and sudden changes in contracts which lead the players to access power exchanges. These needs to be considered in forecasting models. Such models are observed to considerably reduce forecasting errors by outperforming other models under conditions, which are neither infrequent nor recur at defined intervals.

Saâdaoui F.,A seasonal feedforward neural network to forecast electricity prices,2017,15,"In power industry and management, given the peculiarity and high complexity of the time series, it is highly requested to make models more flexible and well adapted to the data, in order to give them the ability to capture and recognize the most complex patterns, and consequently gain more accuracy in forecasting. To fulfill this aim, we define the seasonal autoregressive neural network (SAR-NN) as a dynamic feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), essentially conceived to forecast electricity prices. The SAR-NN is an ANN-based autoregressive model that considers that autoregressors are only those that are lagged by a multiple of the period p of the dominating seasonality. Moving forward this neural network, step-by-step, allows to generate multiple-steps-ahead reliable forecasts. This model is specifically designed to robustly overcome the strong seasonal effects and the other nonlinear patterns that often harm ANNs forecasting performance. The strategy is tested and compared to a number of homologous models throughout empirical experiments.

Bennedsen M.,A rough multi-factor model of electricity spot prices,2017,7,"We introduce a new continuous-time mathematical model of electricity spot prices which accounts for the most important stylized facts of these time series: seasonality, spikes, stochastic volatility, and mean reversion. Empirical studies have found a possible fifth stylized fact, roughness, and our approach explicitly incorporates this into the model of the prices. Our setup generalizes the popular Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-based multi-factor framework of Benth et al. (2007) and allows us to perform statistical tests to distinguish between an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-based model and a rough model. Further, through the multi-factor approach we account for seasonality and spikes before estimating – and making inference on – the degree of roughness. This is novel in the literature and we present simulation evidence showing that these precautions are crucial for accurate estimation. Lastly, we estimate our model on recent data from six European energy exchanges and find statistical evidence of roughness in five out of six markets. As an application of our model, we show how, in these five markets, a rough component improves short term forecasting of the prices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity prices; Energy markets; Forecasting; Fractals; Mean reversion; Multi-factor modeling; Roughness,Commerce; Continuous time systems; Costs; Estimation; Forecasting; Fractals; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Surface roughness; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Energy markets; European energy exchanges; Mean reversion; Multi factors; Short-term forecasting; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic models; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; fractal analysis; numerical model; price determination; Europe,4,1,1,1,Article
"Rafiei M., Niknam T., Khooban M.-H.",Probabilistic Forecasting of Hourly Electricity Price by Generalization of ELM for Usage in Improved Wavelet Neural Network,2017,60,"In restructured markets where transactions process is competitive, forecasting of electricity price is inevitably an important available tool for market participants. Due to the sensitivity of forecasting issues in market's performance, and high prediction error resulted from the behavior of price series, nowadays probabilistic forecasting highly attracted participants' attention. In this paper, a probabilistic approach for the hourly electricity price forecasting is presented. In the proposed method, the uncertainty of predictor model is considered as the uncertainty factor. The bootstrapping technique is used to implement the uncertainty and since the method is needed to be fast and of low computational cost in the daily forecasting, a generalized learning method is applied, which has high accuracy and speed. This newly presented learning method is based on generalized extreme learning machine approach to be used for improved wavelet neural networks. Also in order to reach more accommodation, the predictor model with the changes of price time series, the wavelet preprocessing is used.

"Wolff G., Feuerriegel S.",Short-term dynamics of day-ahead and intraday electricity prices,2017,6,"Purpose: Since the liberalization of electricity markets in the European Union, prices are subject to market dynamics. Hence, understanding the short-term drivers of electricity prices is of major interest to electricity companies and policymakers. Accordingly, this paper aims to study movements of prices in the combined German and Austrian electricity market. Design/methodology/approach: This paper estimates an autoregressive model with exogenous variables (ARX) in a two-step procedure. In the first step, both time series, which inherently feature seasonality, are de-seasonalized, and in the second step, the influence of all model variables on the two dependent variables, i.e. the day-ahead and intraday European Power Energy Exchange prices, is measured. Findings: The results reveal that the short-term market is largely driven by seasonality, consumer demand and short-term feed-ins from renewable energy sources. As a contribution to the existing body of literature, this paper specifically compares the price movements in day-ahead and intraday markets. In intraday markets, the influences of renewable energies are much stronger than in day-ahead markets, i.e. by 24.12 per cent for wind and 116.82 per cent for solar infeeds. Originality/value: Knowledge on the price setting mechanism in the intraday market is particularly scarce. This paper contributes to existing research on this topic by deriving drivers in the intraday market and then contrasting them to the day-ahead market. A more thorough understanding is especially crucial for all stakeholders, who can use this knowledge to optimize their bidding strategies. Furthermore, the findings suggest policy implications for a more stable and efficient electricity market. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Autoregressive; Electricity; External drivers; Modelling; Pricing; Renewable energies; Time series analysis; Weather influence,Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric industry; Electricity; Models; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive model with exogenous variable (ARX); Dependent variables; Design/methodology/approach; Electricity companies; Policy implications; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Power markets,4,1,"1, 2",1,Article
"Abate G.D., Haldrup N.",Space-time modeling of electricity spot prices,2017,1,"Using data for the Nord Pool power grid, we derive a space-time Durbin model for electricity spot prices with both temporal and spatial lags. Joint modeling of temporal and spatial adjustment effects is necessarily important when prices and loads are determined in a network grid. By using different spatial weight matrices, statistical tests show significant spatial dependence in the spot price dynamics across areas. In fact, estimation of the model shows that the spatial dependence is as important as the temporal dependence in describing the spot price dynamics. We decompose price impacts into direct and indirect effects and demonstrate how price effects transmit to neighboring markets and decline with distance. A forecasting comparison with a non-spatial model shows that the space-time model improves forecasting performance for 7 and 30 days ahead forecasts. A model with time-varying parameters is estimated for an expanded sample period and it is found that the spatial correlation within the power grid has increased over time. We interpret this to indicate an increasing degree of market integration within the sample period. © 2017 by the IAEE.

"Yang Z., Ce L., Lian L.","Electricity price forecasting by a hybrid model, combining wavelet transform, ARMA and kernel-based extreme learning machine methods",2017,138,"Electricity prices have rather complex features such as high volatility, high frequency, nonlinearity, mean reversion and non-stationarity that make forecasting very difficult. However, accurate electricity price forecasting is essential to market traders, retailers, and generation companies. To improve prediction accuracy using each model's unique features, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines the wavelet transform, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) based on self-adapting particle swarm optimization and an auto regressive moving average (ARMA). Self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) is adopted to search for the optimal kernel parameters of the KELM. After testing the wavelet decomposition components, stationary series as new input sets are predicted by the ARMA model and non-stationary series are predicted by the SAPSO-KELM model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using electricity price data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), Australian and Spanish markets.

Ziel F.,Forecasting Electricity Spot Prices Using Lasso: On Capturing the Autoregressive Intraday Structure,2016,48,"In this paper we present a regression based model for day-ahead electricity spot prices. We estimate the considered linear regression model by the lasso estimation method. The lasso approach allows for many possible parameters in the model, but also shrinks and sparsifies the parameters automatically to avoid overfitting. Thus, it is able to capture the autoregressive intraday dependency structure of the electricity price well.

"Marcjasz G., Uniejewski B., Weron R.",Beating the naïve-combining lasso with naïve intraday electricity price forecasts,2020,6,"In the last three decades the vast majority of electricity price forecasting (EPF) research has concerned day-ahead markets. However, the rapid expansion of renewable generation-mostly wind and solar-have shifted the focus to intraday markets, which can be used to balance the deviations between positions taken in the day-ahead market and the actual demand and renewable generation. A recent EPF study claims that the German intraday, continuous-time market for hourly products is weak-form efficient, that is, that the best predictor for the so-called ID3-Price index is the most recent transaction price. Here, we undermine this claim and show that we can beat the naïve forecast by combining it with a prediction of a parameter-rich model estimated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We further argue, that that if augmented with timely predictions of fundamental variables for the coming hours, the LASSO-estimated model itself can significantly outperform the naïve forecast. © 2020 by the authors.",Averaging forecasts; Fundamental variables; ID3-Price index; Intraday electricity market; LASSO; Price forecasting; Variable selection,Continuous time systems; Forecasting; Fundamental variables; LASSO; Price forecasting; Price index; Variable selection; Power markets,4,1,2,2,Article
"Ghasemi A., Shayeghi H., Moradzadeh M., Nooshyar M.",A novel hybrid algorithm for electricity price and load forecasting in smart grids with demand-side management,2016,95,"Smart grid is a platform that enables the participants of electricity market to adjust their bidding strategies based on Demand-Side Management (DSM) models. Responsiveness of the market participants can improve reliability of system operation as well as capital cost investments. In this regard, the accurate forecast of electricity price and demand in smart grids is an important challenge as their strong correlation makes a separate forecasting to be ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneous forecast of price and demand that uses a set of effective tools in preprocessing part, forecast engine and tuned algorithm. To highlight our contributions, the proposed forecast algorithm classified into three main parts. The first part employs a new Flexible Wavelet Packet Transform (FWPT) to decompose a signal into multiple terms at different frequencies, and a new feature selection method that employs Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) and adjacent features in order to select valuable input data. The second part consists of a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model based on Nonlinear Least Square Support Vector Machine (NLSSVM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in order to model the linear and nonlinear correlation between price and load in two stages. The final part employs a modified version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm based on time-varying coefficients and stumble generation operator, called TV-SABC, in order to optimize NLSSVM parameters in a learning process. The proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm is evaluated on several real and well-known markets illustrating its high accuracy in simultaneous forecast of electricity price and demand. Moreover, the interactive effects of demand-side management programs on load factor (load curve) and price signal are investigated by numerical indices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Demand-side management; Feature selection; Load and price forecasting; Smart grids; Wavelet transform,Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Demand side management; Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Investments; Learning algorithms; MIMO systems; Optimization; Packet networks; Power markets; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Conditional mutual information; Feature selection methods; Multi-input-multi-output models; Price forecasting; Smart grid; Wavelet packet transforms; Smart power grids; algorithm; capital market; correlation; demand analysis; demand-side management; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; wavelet analysis; Apoidea,"4, 5","1, 2",1,1,Article
"Aneiros G., Vilar J., Raña P.",Short-term forecast of daily curves of electricity demand and price,2016,31,"The features of the electricity, as well as the rules of the competitive electricity markets, create the need of accurate predictions of electricity demand and price in order to anticipate decisions. Mainly, the prediction task in energy markets has been studied in the literature with the aim of obtaining scalar (hourly, daily, ...) forecasts given scalar (and/or, less frequently, functional) historical data. This paper provides two methods to predict next-day electricity demand and price daily curves given information from past curves. They are based on using robust functional principal component analysis and nonparametric models with functional both response and covariate. In addition, the nonparametric proposal is extended to incorporate, in a linear way, exogenous scalar covariates. Results of these methods for the electricity market of mainland Spain, in year 2012, are reported. Their accuracy is compared with that of a naïve method as well as with the corresponding to combining forecasts. Scalar versions are also included in the comparative study.

For this reason, rather than a simple point forecast, market participants are more interested in a probabilistic forecast that is essential to estimate the uncertainty involved in the price. By focusing on this issue, the aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of external factors in the electricity price and present a methodology for probabilistic forecasting of day-ahead electricity prices from the Iberian electricity market.

"Woo C.K., Moore J., Schneiderman B., Ho T., Olson A., Alagappan L., Chawla K., Toyama N., Zarnikau J.",Merit-order effects of renewable energy and price divergence in California's day-ahead and real-time electricity markets,2016,64,"We answer two policy questions: (1) what are the estimated merit-order effects of renewable energy in the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO's) day-ahead market (DAM) and real-time market (RTM)? and (2) what causes the hourly DAM and RTM prices to systematically diverge? The first question is timely and relevant because if the merit-order effect estimates are small, California's renewable energy development is of limited help in cutting electricity consumers' bills but also has a lesser adverse impact on the state's investment incentive for natural-gas-fired generation. The second question is related to the efficient market hypothesis under which the hourly RTM and DAM prices tend to converge. Using a sample of about 21,000 hourly observations of CAISO market prices and their fundamental drivers during 12/12/2012-04/30/2015, we document statistically significant estimates (p-value≤0.01) for the DAM and RTM merit-order effects. This finding lends support to California's adopted procurement process to provide sufficient investment incentives for natural-gas-fired generation. We document that the RTM-DAM price divergence partly depends on the CASIO's day-ahead forecast errors for system loads and renewable energy. This finding suggests that improving the performance of the CAISO's day-ahead forecasts can enhance trading efficiency in California's DAM and RTM electricity markets. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",California; Day-ahead market; Electricity prices; Merit-order effects; Real-time market; Renewable energy,Commerce; Costs; Dams; Electric utilities; Investments; Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; California; Day ahead market; Electricity prices; Ordering effects; Real-time market; Renewable energies; Power markets; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; energy policy; price dynamics; renewable resource; California; United States,4,1,"1, 2",1,Article

Here, we consider two novel extensions of this concept to probabilistic forecasting: one based on Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) applied to a set of point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows, the other on a technique dubbed Quantile Regression Machine (QRM), which first averages these point predictions, then applies quantile regression to the combined forecast. Once computed, we combine the probabilistic forecasts across calibration windows by averaging probabilities of the corresponding predictive distributions. Our results show that QRM is not only computationally more efficient, but also yields significantly more accurate distributional predictions, as measured by the aggregate pinball score and the test of conditional predictive ability. Moreover, combining probabilistic forecasts brings further significant accuracy gains. c 2019 by the authors.",Autoregression; Average probability forecast; Calibration window; Combining forecasts; Conditional predictive ability; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive distribution,Calibration; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Regression analysis; Autoregression; Combining forecasts; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive abilities; Predictive distributions; Probability forecasts; Power markets,4,2,1,2,Article

"Alonso A.M., Bastos G., García-Martos C.",Electricity price forecasting by averaging dynamic factor models,2016,6,"In the context of the liberalization of electricity markets, forecasting prices is essential. With this aim, research has evolved to model the particularities of electricity prices. In particular, dynamic factor models have been quite successful in the task, both in the short and long run. However, specifying a single model for the unobserved factors is difficult, and it cannot be guaranteed that such a model exists. In this paper, model averaging is employed to overcome this difficulty, with the expectation that electricity prices would be better forecast by a combination of models for the factors than by a single model. Although our procedure is applicable in other markets, it is illustrated with an application to forecasting spot prices of the Iberian Market, MIBEL (The Iberian Electricity Market).

"He K., Yu L., Tang L.",Electricity price forecasting with a BED (Bivariate EMD Denoising) methodology,2015,22,"The forecasting of electricity price remains the subject of increasingly intense research attention as the market structure becomes more complicated with the deregulation waves and the increasing level of price fluctuations observed. The heterogeneous data structure revealed in the recent empirical studies serves as the important stylized fact to be explored and analyzed in the heterogeneous market structure framework. Facing the increasingly diversified and more integrated market environment, the forecasting model in the electricity markets needs to take into account the individual and inter dependent heterogeneity features such as noises. In this paper, under the proposed HMH (Heterogeneous Market Hypothesis), we propose a BED (Bivariate EMD Denoising) based forecasting methodology to track and predict the electricity price movement.

"Grossi L., Nan F.",Robust smooth transition threshold autoregressive models for electricity prices,2015,3,"In this paper we suggest the use of robust STAR (Smooth Transition AutoRegressive) processes to model and forecast electricity prices observed on deregulated markets. The robustness of the model is achieved by extending to time series the M-type estimator based on the polynomial weighting function first introduced for independent multivariate data. The robust M-STAR estimator can be considered as a generalization of the robust SETAR estimator [1], because in STAR processes the change from one regime to another is ruled by a smooth function rather than by a fixed threshold. The main advantage of estimating robust STAR models is the possibility to capture two very well-known stylized facts of electricity prices: nonlinearity produced by changes of regimes and the presence of sudden spikes due to inelasticity of demand. The forecasting performance of the model is assessed through an application to the Italian electricity market (IPEX). By means of prediction performance indexes and tests, robust and non-robust STAR models for electricity prices are compared. © 2015 IEEE.",Electricity prices; Extreme values; M-estimator; Nonlinear models; Smooth Transition AutoRegressive processes,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Estimation; Forecasting; Power markets; Auto regressive process; Electricity prices; Extreme value; M-estimators; Non-linear model; Power quality,4,1,1,1,Conference
"Shah I., Lisi F.",Forecasting of electricity price through a functional prediction of sale and purchase curves,2020,4,"This work proposes a new approach for the prediction of the electricity price based on forecasting aggregated purchase and sale curves. The basic idea is to model the hourly purchase and the sale curves, to predict them and to find the intersection of the predicted curves in order to obtain the predicted equilibrium market price and volume. Modeling and forecasting of purchase and sale curves is performed by means of functional data analysis methods. More specifically, parametric (FAR) and nonparametric (NPFAR) functional autoregressive models are considered and compared to some benchmarks. An appealing feature of the functional approach is that, unlike other methods, it provides insights into the sale and purchase mechanism connected with the price and demand formation process and can therefore be used for the optimization of bidding strategies.

It is an aggregate that equals the average of hourly prices for delivery during each of the 24 individual hours. This paper demonstrates that the disaggregated hourly prices contain useful predictive information for the daily average price in the Nord Pool market. Multivariate models for the full panel of hourly prices significantly outperform univariate models of the daily average price, with reductions in Root Mean Squared Error of up to 16%.

"Garciá-Martos C., Caro E., Jesús Sánchez M.",Electricity price forecasting accounting for renewable energies: Optimal combined forecasts,2015,2,"Electricity price forecasting is an interesting problem for all the agents involved in electricity market operation. For instance, every profit maximisation strategy is based on the computation of accurate one-day-ahead forecasts, which is why electricity price forecasting has been a growing field of research in recent years. In addition, the increasing concern about environmental issues has led to a high penetration of renewable energies, particularly wind. In some European countries such as Spain, Germany and Denmark, renewable energy is having a deep impact on the local power markets. In this paper, we propose an optimal model from the perspective of forecasting accuracy, and it consists of a combination of several univariate and multivariate time series methods that account for the amount of energy produced with clean energies, particularly wind and hydro, which are the most relevant renewable energy sources in the Iberian Market. This market is used to illustrate the proposed methodology, as it is one of those markets in which wind power production is more relevant in terms of its percentage of the total demand, but of course our method can be applied to any other liberalised power market. As far as our contribution is concerned, first, the methodology proposed by Garciá-Martos et al (2007 and 2012) is generalised twofold: we allow the incorporation of wind power production and hydro reservoirs, and we do not impose the restriction of using the same model for 24 h. A computational experiment and a Design of Experiments (DOE) are performed for this purpose. Then, for those hours in which there are two or more models without statistically significant differences in terms of their forecasting accuracy, a combination of forecasts is proposed by weighting the best models (according to the DOE) and minimising the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAPE is the most popular accuracy metric for comparing electricity price forecasting models. We construct the combination of forecasts by solving several nonlinear optimisation problems that allow computation of the optimal weights for building the combination of forecasts. The results are obtained by a large computational experiment that entails calculating out-of-sample forecasts for every hour in every day in the period from January 2007 to December 2009. In addition, to reinforce the value of our methodology, we compare our results with those that appear in recent published works in the field. This comparison shows the superiority of our methodology in terms of forecasting accuracy. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.

The prediction time horizon is 12 weeks-ahead and is applied to the North Brazilian submarket, which adopts a cost-based model with unique characteristics of price behavior.

"De Marcos R.A., Reneses J., Bello A.",Long-term Spanish electricity market price forecasting with cointegration and VEC models,2016,2,"Commodity and electricity price models are motivated by the several unexpected evolutions that commodity prices have shown over the previous decades.

"Wu L., Shahidehpour M.",A hybrid model for integrated day-ahead electricity price and load forecasting in smart grid,2014,37,"Load and price forecasting are two key issues for market participants and system operators in electricity markets. Most existing works predict load and price separately. However, a dynamic pricing type scenario is envisioned in smart grid, where consumers may have the ability to react to constantly changing price signals by shifting electricity usages from expensive hours to others, which would consequently impact electricity prices. Thus, price and load signals are strongly coupled, and previous separated forecast models may not be as effective. In this study, a two-stage integrated price and load forecasting framework is developed. The first stage provides initial price and load forecasts separately, and the second stage considers load and price interaction with initial forecasts as inputs. At each stage, a hybrid time-series and adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) model is used, in which multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average catches the linear relationship of price and load log return series, generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic unveils heteroscedastic character of residuals and AWNN presents non-linear impacts. Several criteria such as average mean absolute percentage error and error variance are used to measure the forecasting accuracy.

The paper in the introduction describes the algorithm that governs the operation of the Day- Ahead Market in the Italian Power Exchange and proposes an econometric model for short-term forecasting (six months or a year) of the daily Single National Price (Prezzo Unico Nazionale, PUN) of electricity. The model includes constants, regressors, moving averages, weekly and seasonal dummies, autoregressive and heteroschedastic variables. The results show a significant decrease in error of the short-term forecast of the analyzed time series, in comparison with the method of linear least squares, traditionally used in literature. An analysis on the influence of different variables on PUN such as brent, solar radiation and weather has been reported. A comparison of the different models with specific indices have been performed and discussed. © 2014 Econjournals.

As an example, the verified highest electricity price return in March 2007 was almost 260%. The volatility of a commodity plays an important role in the study of the risk management. It also improves the efficiency in parameter estimation and the accuracy in interval forecast.

The results have shown that the model is able to estimate the behavior of the volatility. ©2008 IEEE.",Electricity price; GARCH; Volatility,Arsenic compounds; Costs; Electricity; Geographical regions; Marketing; Occupational risks; Parameter estimation; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risk perception; Electricity price; Electricity pricing; European; GARCH; Volatility; Electric network analysis,4,1,1,2,Conference
"Deng S.-J., Jiang W.",An inverse-quantile function approach for modeling electricity price,2002,2,"We propose a class of alternative stochastic volatility models for electricity prices using the quantile function modeling approach. Specifically, we fit marginal distributions of power prices to two special classes of distributions by matching the quantile of an empirical distribution to that of a theoretical distribution. The distributions from the first class have closed form formulas for probability densities, probability distribution functions, and quantile functions, while the distributions from the second class may have extremely unbalanced tails. Having rich tail behaviors, both classes allow realistic modeling of the power price dynamics. The appealing features of this approach are that it can effectively model the heavy tail behavior of electricity prices caused by jumps and stochastic volatility and that the resulting distributions are easy to simulate. This latter feature enables us to perform both parameter estimation and derivative pricing tasks based on price data directly observed from real markets. © 2002 IEEE.",Electricity supply industry; Energy management; ISO; Mathematical model; Power markets; Power system management; Pricing; Probability distribution; Risk management; Stochastic processes,Commerce; Costs; Distribution functions; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric utilities; Energy management; Inverse problems; Mathematical models; Power markets; Probability; Random processes; Risk management; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Empirical distributions; ISO; Marginal distribution; Power system management; Probability densities; Quantile functions; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic Volatility Model; Probability distributions,4,3,1,2,Conference

The factor model is applied to Turkish day ahead electricity market. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed multifactor model, estimation results are also compared to the results acquired by application of mean reverting jump diffusion model of Cartea and Figueroa (2005) and Markov regime switching model of Janczura and Weron (2010) to the same data set. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As the prices at which the energy will be purchased are unknown until the end of the bidding process, forecasting of spot prices has become an essential element in electricity management strategies. In this article, we apply forecasting factor models to the market framework in Spain and Portugal and study their performance.

"Miranian A., Abdollahzade M., Hassani H.",Day-ahead electricity price analysis and forecasting by singular spectrum analysis,2013,28,"This study proposes a model-free approach for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. The proposed approached is based on the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique. The SSA is a relatively new and powerful technique in time series analysis and forecasting thanks to its well-known capabilities in extracting the main structure of the broad classes of the time series. In this study, it is shown that SSA can be employed to decompose the original electricity price series into trend, periodic and noisy components. The main part of the price series, that is, the trend and harmonic components, is reconstructed by removing the noise component from the original series. The reconstructed price series is then used for forecasting the day-ahead electricity prices. The proposed approach is evaluated by analysing and forecasting of the dayahead electricity prices in the Australian and Spanish electricity markets. The forecasting results confirm the superiority of the SSA approach compared with some of the recently published forecasting techniques. ©The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",,Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price series; Electricity prices; Forecasting techniques; Harmonic components; Noise components; Singular spectrum analysis; Spanish electricity markets; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Forecasting; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Costs,4,1,1,1,Article
Cifter A.,Forecasting electricity price volatility with the Markov-switching GARCH model: Evidence from the Nordic electric power market,2013,38,"In this paper, electricity price behavior in the Nordic electric power market is forecasted with both the Markov-switching generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MS-GARCH) model and a set of different volatility models. The MS-GARCH model is estimated with two regimes, representing periods of low and high volatility. This study shows that electricity price volatility is not only highly volatile but also strongly regime-dependent. The empirical results show that the MS-GARCH model enables more accurate forecasting than the standard GARCH models, according to tail loss and reality check tests for one- and multi-step ahead forecasts. The results suggest that both the electricity generation companies and consumers of electricity could carry out better price forecasts by using the proposed MS-GARCH model. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Li X.R., Yu C.W., Ren S.Y., Chiu C.H., Meng K.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting based on panel cointegration and particle filter,2013,28,"An accurate forecasting of energy price is important for generation companies (GENCOs) to develop their bidding strategies or to make investment decisions. Nowadays, day-ahead electricity market is closely associated with other commodity markets such as fuel market and emission market. Under such an environment, day-ahead electricity price is volatile and its volatility changes overtime due to the uncertainties from the multi-market. This paper proposes a two-stage hybrid model based on panel cointegration and particle filter (PCPF). Panel cointegration (PC) model, which utilizes information of both the inter-temporal dynamics and the individuality of interconnected regions, provides powerful forecasting tool for electricity price. Particle filter (PF) has achieved significant successes in tracking applications involving non-Gaussian signals and nonlinear systems. This paper has two main focuses: (1) To expand the dimension of electricity price dataset from time series to panel data so that the dynamics of interconnected regions can be analyzed simultaneously and considered as a whole. (2) Regarding the model coefficients as a time-varying process, PF is used to forecast electricity price adaptively. In the case study, the proposed PCPF model is applied to the real electricity market data of PJM in the year 2008. Promising results show clearly the superior predicting behavior of the proposed modeling. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Voronin S., Partanen J.",Price forecasting in the day-ahead energy market by an iterative method with separate normal price and price spike frameworks,2013,32,"A forecasting methodology for prediction of both normal prices and price spikes in the day-ahead energy market is proposed. The method is based on an iterative strategy implemented as a combination of two modules separately applied for normal price and price spike predictions. The normal price module is a mixture of wavelet transform, linear AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and nonlinear neural network models. The probability of a price spike occurrence is produced by a compound classifier in which three single classification techniques are used jointly to make a decision. Combined with the spike value prediction technique, the output from the price spike module aims to provide a comprehensive price spike forecast. The overall electricity price forecast is formed as combined normal price and price spike forecasts. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated with real data from the Finnish Nord Pool Spot day-ahead energy market.

Dudek G.,Probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices using kernel regression,2018,1,"Electricity price forecasting has become crucial for energy companies due to its fundamental importance for decision making processes and operational management. Electricity price time series exhibit variable means, significant volatility and spikes, which places high demands on forecasting models. Moreover, in recent years researchers and practitioners have come to understand the limitations of point forecasts and require models to generate probabilistic forecasts. In contrast to point forecasts, the probabilistic forecasts takes the form of a predictive probability distribution over future quantities or events of interest. In the paper the probabilistic forecasting model based on Nadaraya- Watson estimator is proposed. The model generates the point forecasts as 24-component vectors representing day-ahead electricity prices. The probabilistic forecasts are calculated as quantiles based on the residual distribution for historical data forecasts. The performance of the proposed model is validated by testing on data from the Polish electricity market. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Kernel regression; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile forecasts,Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Decision making process; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Kernel regression; Operational management; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic forecasts; Residual distribution; Power markets,4,1,1,2,Conference
"Cruz A., Muñoz A., Zamora J.L., Espínola R.",The effect of wind generation and weekday on Spanish electricity spot price forecasting,2011,68,"This paper empirically compares the predictive accuracy of a set of methods for day-ahead spot price forecasting in the Spanish electricity market. The methods come from time series analysis and artificial intelligence disciplines, and include univariate, multivariate, linear and nonlinear. Within the univariate methods, the double seasonal ARIMA and the recently proposed exponential smoothing for double seasonality are compared and used as benchmarks. They allow us to quantify the improvement on price forecasting when including explanatory variables or using more complex models. Dynamic regression models including the electricity load forecast are then considered. Their good performance in price forecasting has been pointed out by many authors. However, we find evidences of their predictive accuracy can be significantly outperformed by accounting the wind generation forecast provided by the System Operator. Moreover, these forecasts can be even more accurate if changes of price's behavior according with the day of the week are taken into account by means of periodic models. The last of the tested methods are feed-forward neural networks used as multivariate nonlinear regression methods with universal function approximation capabilities. The influence of the wind generation forecast on price prediction is also proved with this approach. Detailed out-of-sample results of the tested methods are given. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Shafie-Khah M., Moghaddam M.P., Sheikh-El-Eslami M.K.",Price forecasting of day-ahead electricity markets using a hybrid forecast method,2011,146,"Energy price forecasting in a competitive electricity market is crucial for the market participants in planning their operations and managing their risk, and it is also the key information in the economic optimization of the electric power industry. However, price series usually have a complex behavior due to their nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variancy. In this paper, a novel hybrid method to forecast day-ahead electricity price is proposed. This hybrid method is based on wavelet transform, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFN). The wavelet transform provides a set of better-behaved constitutive series than price series for prediction. ARIMA model is used to generate a linear forecast, and then RBFN is developed as a tool for nonlinear pattern recognition to correct the estimation error in wavelet-ARIMA forecast. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the network structure which makes the RBFN be adapted to the specified training set, reducing computation complexity and avoiding overfitting. The proposed method is examined on the electricity market of mainland Spain and the results are compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods.

Therefore, generation companies need accurate price forecasting tools. Comparison of neural network and auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to forecast commodity prices in pervious researches showed that the artificial neural network (ANN) forecasts were considerably more accurate than traditional ARIMA models. This paper provides an accurate and efficient tool for shortterm price forecasting based on the combination of ANN and ARIMA. Firstly, input variables for ANN are determined by time series analysis. This model relates the current prices to the values of past prices. Secondly, ANN is used for one day-ahead price forecasting. A three-layered feed-forward neural network algorithm is used for forecasting next-day electricity prices. The ANN model is then trained and tested using data from electricity market of Iran. According to pervious studies, in the case of neural networks and ARIMA models, historical demand data do not significantly improve predictions.

Due to the day-time variations in load and thereby electrical energy price, it is wise to use different models for forecasting energy price at different hours. In this paper, three different single-hour models are used to forecast electricity price at off peak, plateau, and peak load. A 24-hour model is also used to forecast electricity price of all hours simultaneously. Analysis of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions suggests different models for each single hour model as well as the 24-hour model. The best models for off peak, plateau, and peak load are obtained to be ARIMA(1,1,1), ARIMA(2,1,1) and ARIMA(0,1,1), respectively. In addition, the time-series analyses result in an AR(2) model with 24-hour period for the 24-hour model as the most suitable model. The models are compared from viewpoints of accuracy and time consuming. The comparison shows that the user should compromise between accuracy and speed, when selecting singlehour or 24-hour models. ©2010 IEEE.",Autocorrelation; Electrical energy; Forecasting; Partial autocorrelation; Time series,Best model; Electrical energy; Electricity prices; Energy prices; Partial autocorrelation; Partial autocorrelation function; Peak load; Power markets; Time variations; Adaptive filtering; Autocorrelation; Costs; Harmonic analysis; Regression analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Electric load forecasting,4,1,1,1,Conference

In the proposed grey model, two kinds of price sequences, called the main sequence (MS) and the reference sequence (RS), are defined. The correlation coefficient between price sequences of adjacent time intervals is analyzed, which is more than 0.9522 obtained from the Nordpool data in 2007.

"Redl C., Haas R., Huber C., Böhm B.",Price formation in electricity forward markets and the relevance of systematic forecast errors,2009,65,"Since the liberalisation of the European electricity sector, forward and futures contracts have gained significant interest of market participants due to risk management reasons. For pricing of these contracts an important fact concerns the non-storability of electricity. In this case, according to economic theory, forward prices are related to the expected spot prices which are built on fundamental market expectations. In the following article the crucial impact parameters of forward electricity prices and the relationship between forward and future spot prices will be assessed by an empirical analysis of electricity prices at the European Energy Exchange and the Nord Pool Power Exchange. In fact, price formation in the considered markets is influenced by historic spot market prices yielding a biased forecasting power of long-term contracts. Although market and risk assessment measures of market participants and supply and demand shocks can partly explain the futures-spot bias inefficiencies in the analysed forward markets cannot be ruled out. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

"Aggarwal S.K., Saini L.M., Kumar A.",Price forecasting using wavelet transform and LSE based mixed model in Australian electricity market,2008,18,"Purpose - Price forecasting is essential for risk management in deregulated electricity markets. The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid technique using wavelet transform (WT) and multiple linear regression (MLR) to forecast price profile in electricity markets. Design/methodology/approach - Price series is highly volatile and non-stationary in nature. In this work, initially complete price series has been decomposed into separate 48 half-hourly series and then these series have been categorized into different segments for price forecasting. For some segments, WT based MLR has been applied and for the other segments, simple MLR model has been applied. The model is general in nature and has been implemented for one day-ahead price forecasting in National Electricity Market (NEM) of Australia. Participants can use the technique practically, since it predicts price well before submission of bids. Findings - Forecasting performance of the proposed WT and MLR based mixed model has been compared with the three other models, an analytical model, a MLR model and an artificial neural network (ANN) based model. The proposed model was found to be better. Performance evaluation for different wavelets was performed, and it has been observed that for improving forecasting accuracy using WT, Daubechies wavelet of order two gives the best performance. Originality/value - Forecasting accuracy improvement of an established technique by incorporating time domain and wavelet domain variables of the same time series into one set has been implemented in this work. The paper also attempts to explain how non-stationarity can be removed from a non-stationary time series by applying WT after appropriate statistical investigation. Moreover, real time electricity markets are highly unpredictable and yet under investigated. The model has been applied to NEM for the same reason. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Australia; Correlation analysis; Demand forecasting; Electricity industry; Financial forecasting; Volatility,Backpropagation; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electricity; Forecasting; Fourier transforms; Marketing; Network performance; Neural networks; Risk analysis; Risk management; Time series; Wavelet transforms; Australia; Correlation analysis; Demand forecasting; Electricity industry; Financial forecasting; Volatility; Electric load forecasting,4,1,1,1,Article

"Ofuji K., Kanemoto S.",Price forecasting of Japan electric power exchange using time-varying AR model,2007,5,"In this article, we built a state space model to analyze the price time series in Japan Electric Power Exchange(JEPX) spot market. In building the model, we aimed to achieve the following two goals that the model was able to a) forecast prices with reasonable accuracy, and b) understand the underlying market dynamics by decomposing the price time series into a reasonable set of contributing factors. To capture the time-variability of the contributing factors to price, self-AR(autoregressive) process was introduced to allow continuous change in the magnitude of influence from each explanatory variable. To estimate the model, Kalman Filter algorithm was applied for stepwise recursive estimation. After optimizing the model under the maximum likelihood method(MLM) coupled with minimum AIC(Akaike Information Criteria) conditions, the model was able to decompose the 15:00-15:30 JEPX spot electricity strip price into a couple of the most contributing factors with significant time-dependencies.

"Mandal P., Senjyu T., Yona A., Park J.-W., Srivastava A.K.",Sensitivity analysis of similar days parameters for predicting short-term electricity price,2007,9,"This paper describes an identification of the best similar days parameters for artificial neural network (ANN) based short-term price forecasting. The work presented in this paper is an extended version of our previous works where we proposed the price prediction technique by using ANN, which is based on similar days method. According to similar days method, we select similar price days corresponding to forecast day based on Euclidean norm. The focus of the present paper is mainly on sensitivity analysis of similar days parameter while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the PJM electricity market. We simulated three cases by: (i) selecting two similar days parameters (load at t and price at t); (ii) selecting three similar days parameters (load at t, price at t and price at t - 1), and (iii) selecting five similar days parameters (load at t, load at t - 1, load at t + 1, price at t and price at t - 1). The next-24h price forecasts obtained from ANN based on similar days method confirm that the performance of the ANN model is better when five similar days parameters are selected, i.e., the accuracy of the method is enhanced by the addition of load at t - 1 and t + 1. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, and historical price factors are well discussed. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of reasonably small values were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination of (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. © 2007 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Electricity price forecasting; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Power market; Similar days,Backpropagation; Correlation methods; Error analysis; Forecasting; Neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; ANN modeling; Artificial neural network; Correlation co-efficient; Electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity pricing; Euclidean norms; Load factors; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Mean absolute percentage error; Mean-square errors; Power market; Price factors; Price forecasting; Price prediction; Similar days; Time factors; Electric load forecasting,"4, 5",1,1,1,Conference

A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) methodology is presented to predict day-ahead electricity prices. For the high volatility of the electricity prices, the GARCH model is more suitable for illustrating the time series data than other forecast model adopted generally. The prediction error is assumed to be serially correlated other than independent variable with zero mean and constant variance, which can be modeled by an Auto Regressive process.

"Benaouda D., Murtagh F.",Hybrid wavelet model for electricity pool-price forecasting in a deregulated electricity market,2006,6,"Electricity supply industry is in the process of deregulation in many countries including Australia. The purpose of deregulation is to give consumers free choices of their electricity supply. Thus, accurate electricity pool price forecasting can provide a set of vital predicted information that helps generation, transmission and retailer participating companies to bid strategically into a deregulated electricity market in order to maximize their profits. In this article, we propose a wavelet multiscale decomposition based autoregressive approach for the prediction of one-hour ahead and one-day ahead pool price based on historical electricity pool price and predicted electricity load data. This approach is based on a multiple resolution decomposition of the signal using the non-decimated or redundant Haar à trous wavelet transform whose advantage is taking into account the asymmetric nature of the time-varying data. There is an additional computational advantage in that there is no need to re-compute the wavelet transform (wavelet coefficients) of the full signal if the electricity pool price data (time series) is regularly updated. We assess results produced by this multiscale autoregressive (MAR) method, in both linear and non-linear variants, with single resolution autoregressive (AR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) model.

"Zareipour H., Cañzares C.A., Bhattacharya K., Thomson J.",Application of public-domain market information to forecast Ontario's wholesale electricity prices,2006,111,"This paper evaluates the usefulness of publicly available electricity market information in forecasting the hourly Ontario energy price (HOEP). In order to do so, relevant data from Ontario and its neighboring electricity markets, namely, New York, New England, and PJM electricity markets, are investigated, and a final set of explanatory variable candidates that are available before real-time are selected. Multivariate transfer function and dynamic regression models are employed to relate HOEP behavior to the selected explanatory variable candidates. Univariate ARIMA models are also developed for the HOEP. The HOEP models are developed on the basis of two forecasting horizons, i.e., 3 h and 24 h, and forecasting performance of the multivariate models is compared with that of the univariate models. The outcomes show that the market information publicly available before real-time can be used to improve HOEP forecast accuracy to some extent; however, unusually high or low prices remain unpredictable, and hence, the available data cannot lead to significantly more accurate forecasts. Nevertheless, the generated forecasts in this paper are significantly more accurate than currently available HOEP forecasts. To analyze the relatively low accuracy of the HOEP forecasts, comparisons are made with respect to ARIMA models developed for locational marginal prices (LMPs) of Ontario's three neighboring markets, and price volatility analyses are presented. © 2006 IEEE.",Electricity markets; Price forecasting; Time series models; Volatility analysis,Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Marketing; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Transfer functions; Electricity markets; Price forecasting; Volatility analysis; Electric power systems,4,1,1,1,Article

Compared with load, the price of electricity is volatile, but it is not regarded as random; therefore it is possible to identify patterns based on historical data and load forecast. Market participants only have access to the public information provided by the Independent System Operator (ISO); this limits the ability of the market participants to produce accurate price forecast. An accurate estimation of the electricity price helps the market participants to determine their bidding strategy; making necessary the development of accurate price forecasting methods. In this paper the authors propose a statistical method for price forecasting considering the historical price and loads of the California power market; matching the load and price profiles of the forecasting day with historical data of previous similar days. Simulation results show that the forecasted price is closely related with the price historical data and the load of the forecasting day. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by comparing the actual price with the forecasted price and calculating the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

We model the expected value and volatility of the series using i.a. autoregressive and no-trade effects or load, wind and solar generation forecasts and accounting for the non-linearities in e.g. time to maturity. Both the in-sample characteristics and forecasting performance are analysed using a rolling window forecasting study. Multiple versions of the model are compared to several benchmark models and evaluated using probabilistic forecasting measures and significance tests. The study aims to forecast the price distribution in the German Intraday Continuous Market in the last 3 h of trading, but the approach allows for application to other continuous markets, especially in Europe. The results prove superiority of the mixture model over the benchmarks gaining the most from the modelling of the volatility. They also indicate that the introduction of XBID reduced the market volatility. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Continuous-trade markets; Electricity price forecasting; Ensemble forecasting; Generalized additive models; Intraday market; Lasso; Logistic regression; Power markets; Probabilistic forecasting; Scenario simulation; Short-term forecasting; Trajectories; XBID; Zero-inflated distribution,Commerce; Costs; Logistic regression; Mixtures; Solar power generation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Ensemble forecasting; Forecasting performance; Generalized additive model; Market volatility; Probabilistic forecasting; Student's t distribution; Forecasting; electricity; ensemble forecasting; market conditions; performance assessment; price determination; simulation; Europe,4,1,2,2,Article
"Zhou M., Yan Z., Ni Y., Li G.",An ARIMA approach to forecasting electricity price with accuracy improvement by predicted errors,2004,31,"Accurate forecasting electricity price is becoming a crucial issue concerned by market participants either for developing bidding strategies or for making investment decisions. Due to the complicated factors affecting electricity prices, accurate forecasting price turns out to be very difficult and usually cannot be achieved by a single forecasting model. This paper proposes an ARIMA approach to price forecasting with accuracy improvement by predicted errors. Besides a conventional model for price forecasting, models for forecasting residual errors are also established iteratively. ARIMA models for forecasting daily average prices, based on historical data of Californian Power Market, are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Results show that the method only requires easy-implemented low-order models instead of one complex model, while the accuracy of forecasting is improved significantly.

This work investigates the forecasting performance of several models for the 1-day-ahead prediction of demand and prices on four electricity markets (APX Power-UK, Nord Pool, PJM and IPEX). All the models are based on two steps: a nonparametric estimation of some deterministic components, followed by the choice of a suitable model for the residual stochastic component. This latter step includes univariate and multivariate as well as parametric and nonparametric models, with particular emphasis on the functional approach, that models the whole daily profile as a single functional observation. More specifically, the models involved are: a linear model and a nonlinear (nonparametric) autoregressive model, a vector autoregressive model and four autoregressive functional specifications. Prediction covers a whole year. Comparisons are based both on descriptive statistics and on statistical tests of equal forecasting accuracy.

The price of electricity in a deregulated market is very volatile in time. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate an accurate market price using historically observed data. In the proposed method, uncertain market prices are estimated by an autoregressive model using a neural network, and the time series model is extended to fuzzy model to consider the possible ranges of market prices. The neural network finds the crisp value for AR model and then the low and high ranges of fuzzy model are found by linear programming. Therefore, the proposed model can represent the possible ranges of a day-ahead market price.

"Ni E., Luh P.B.",Forecasting power market clearing price and its discrete PDF using a Bayesian-based classification method,2001,49,"Neural network methods have been successfully used for various applications. In time series prediction problems, the regression models such as multiple layer perceptron (MLP) and the radial basis function network (RBF) are usually applied. However, they cannot predict the probability density function (PDF) that is critical for some applications. When there is noise or corrupt data in the process, these regression models could be misled, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. In this paper, a classification method combined with a simple regression model is presented to predict the discrete PDF of power market clearing prices, which is critical for many decision-makings such as optimizing bidding strategies, and is very difficult to predict because of high market uncertainties. Our basic idea is to form a number of classes by discretizing the variable to be predicted, and thus converts the time series prediction problem into a pattern classification problem. The classes are clustered based on historical data, and the input statistics (e.g., input mean and covariance matrix, etc.) corresponding to each class are obtained via clustering. Given a new input, these classes are sorted according to the posterior probabilities calculated by using the Bayes’ formula. The prediction is then generated by using an auto-regression method (AR) for the classes with high posterior probabilities. The classes are then updated after the actual output is available. The method developed can be seen as an RBF with variable structure. The posterior probabilities can be viewed as an approximation of the discrete PDF, providing valuable information for decision-makes and for what if analysis. The developed method has been used to predict the on-peak and off-peak average MCPs in the New England market. The testing results show that it outperforms the RBF network in terms of prediction accuracy and computational time.",Auto-regression; Bayes’ rule; Classification; Deregulated electric power markets; MCP prediction,Decision support systems; Electric power systems; Marketing; Multilayer neural networks; Probability density function; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Uncertain systems; Bayesian classification method; Power market clearing price; Regression model; Electric load forecasting,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article

In this article a new and very easy method to compute accurate forecasts for electricity prices using mixed models is proposed. The main idea is to develop an efficient tool for one-step-ahead forecasting in the future, combining several prediction methods for which forecasting performance has been checked and compared for a span of several years. Also as a novelty, the 24 hourly time series has been modelled separately, instead of the complete time series of the prices. This allows one to take advantage of the homogeneity of these 24 time series. The purpose of this paper is to select the model that leads to smaller prediction errors and to obtain the appropriate length of time to use for forecasting.

"Lu X., Dong Z.Y., Li X.",Electricity market price spike forecast with data mining techniques,2005,88.0,"Electricity market price forecast is a changeling yet very important task for electricity market managers and participants. Due to the complexity and uncertainties in the power grid, electricity prices are highly volatile and normally carry with spikes, which may be tens or even hundreds of times higher than the normal price. Such electricity spikes are very difficult to be predicted. So far, most of the research on electricity price forecast is based on the normal range electricity prices. This paper proposes a data mining based electricity price forecast framework, which can predict the normal price as well as the price spikes. The normal price can be predicted by a previously proposed wavelet and neural network based forecast model, while the spikes are forecasted based on a data mining approach. This paper focuses on the spike prediction and explores the reasons for price spikes based on the measurement of a proposed composite supply-demand balance index (SDI) and relative demand index (RDI). These indices are able to reflect the relationship among electricity demand, electricity supply and electricity reserve capacity. The proposed model is based on a mining database including market clearing price, trading hour, electricity demand, electricity supply and reserve. Bayesian classification and similarity searching techniques are used to mine the database to find out the internal relationships between electricity price spikes and these proposed. The mining results are used to form the price spike forecast model. This proposed model is able to generate forecasted price spike, level of spike and associated forecast confidence level. The model is tested with the Queensland electricity market data with promising results. Crown Copyright © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Christensen T.M., Hurn A.S., Lindsay K.A.",Forecasting spikes in electricity prices,2012,50.0,"In many electricity markets, retailers purchase electricity at an unregulated spot price and sell to consumers at a heavily regulated price. Consequently, the occurrence of spikes in the spot electricity price represents a major source of risk for retailers, and the forecasting of these price spikes is important for effective risk management. Traditional approaches to modelling electricity prices have aimed to predict the trajectory of spot prices. In contrast, this paper focuses on the prediction of price spikes. The time series of price spikes is treated as a discrete-time point process, and a nonlinear variant of the autoregressive conditional hazard model is used to model this process. The model is estimated using half-hourly data from the Australian electricity market for the period 1 March 2001 to 30 June 2007. One-step-ahead forecasts of the probability of a price spike are then generated for each half hour in the forecast period, 1 July 2007 to 30 September 2007. The forecasting performance of the model is then evaluated against a benchmark that is consistent with the assumptions of commonly-used electricity pricing models. © 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.",Autoregressive conditional duration; Autoregressive conditional hazard; Electricity futures; Electricity prices; Price spikes,,4,1,1,1,Article

"Haldrup N., Nielsen F.S., Nielsen M.Ø.",A vector autoregressive model for electricity prices subject to long memory and regime switching,2010,43.0,"A regime dependent VAR model is suggested that allows long memory (fractional integration) in each of the observed regime states as well as the possibility of fractional cointegration. The model is motivated by the dynamics of electricity prices where the transmission of power is subject to occasional congestion periods. For a system of bilateral prices non-congestion means that electricity prices are identical whereas congestion makes prices depart. Hence, the joint price dynamics implies switching between a univariate price process under non-congestion and a bivariate price process under congestion. At the same time, it is an empirical regularity that electricity prices tend to show a high degree of long memory, and thus that prices may be fractionally cointegrated.Analysis of Nord Pool data shows that even though the prices are identical under non-congestion, the prices are not, in general, fractionally cointegrated in the congestion state. Hence, in most cases price convergence is a property following from regime switching rather than a conventional error correction mechanism. Finally, the suggested model is shown to deliver forecasts that are more precise compared to competing models. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Cointegration; Electricity prices; Fractional integration; Long memory; Regime switching,Cointegration; Electricity prices; Fractional integration; Long memories; Regime switching; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Lakes; Switching; Costs; cointegration analysis; commodity price; electricity; empirical analysis; error correction; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; price dynamics; vector autoregression,4,1,1,1,Article

For this reason, many techniques have been proposed to predict electricity market prices in the recent years. However, electricity price is a complex volatile signal owning many spikes. Most of electricity price forecast techniques focus on the normal price prediction, while price spike forecast is a different and more complex prediction process. Price spike forecasting has two main aspects: prediction of price spike occurrence and value.

The hybrid data model includes both wavelet and time domain variables as well as calendar indicators, comprising a large candidate input set. The set is refined by the proposed feature selection technique evaluating both relevancy and redundancy of the candidate inputs.

Many methodologies have been applied to this aim, but in the view of the authors, state space models are not yet fully exploited. The present paper proposes a univariate dynamic harmonic regression model set up in a state space framework for forecasting prices in these markets. The advantages of the approach are threefold. Firstly, a fast automatic identification and estimation procedure is proposed based on the frequency domain. Secondly, the recursive algorithms applied offer adaptive predictions that compare favourably with respect to other techniques. Finally, since the method is based on unobserved components models, explicit information about trend, seasonal and irregular behaviours of the series can be extracted. This information is of great value to the electricity companies' managers in order to improve their strategies, i.e. it provides management innovations.

"Sharma V., Srinivasan D.",A hybrid intelligent model based on recurrent neural networks and excitable dynamics for price prediction in deregulated electricity market,2013,33.0,"This paper examines electricity price time series from dynamical system perspective and proposes a hybrid model which employs a synergistic combination of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and coupled excitable system for prediction of future prices in deregulated electricity markets. Driven by profit maximizing decisions taken by various agents, these markets belong to the class of financial systems. However presence of intermittent spikes and complex dynamic nonlinearities in electricity price time series render the prediction task extremely challenging. The approximation ability of Recurrent Neural Networks to map dynamic functions together with sharp jumping attribute of coupled excitable systems allows close approximation of spiky time series. The developed hybrid model was applied for point and interval forecasting in various markets worldwide over different seasons for testing its adaptability in different environments.

This technique is more useful when a large number of explanatory variable candidates need to be considered. In this paper, the MARS technique is applied to forecast the hourly Ontario energy price (HOEP). The MARS models are developed in this work considering two scenarios for the explanatory variables. In the first scenario, the model is build based solely on the lagged values of the HOEP. In the second scenario, current and lagged values of the latest predispatch price and demand information, made available by the Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), are also considered as explanatory variables.

Thus, there is a need of providing methodology that is able to deal with the most important features of electricity price series, which are well known for presenting not only structure in conditional mean but also time-varying conditional variances. In this work we propose a new model, which allows to extract conditionally heteroskedastic common factors from the vector of electricity prices. These common factors are jointly estimated as well as their relationship with the original vector of series, and the dynamics affecting both their conditional mean and variance. The estimation of the model is carried out under the state-space formulation. The new model proposed is applied to extract seasonal common dynamic factors as well as common volatility factors for electricity prices and the estimation results are used to forecast electricity prices and their volatilities in the Spanish zone of the Iberian Market.

It provides useful information for the market players and the regulators, in both short and long run. Different approaches have been proposed and implemented. A new dynamic approach for forecasting the market price of electricity in the short term is proposed. The price dates are first clustered according to different types of daily profiles and then, given a proper function representing the trend in price, the set of unknown parameters are identified based on the zeroing of a Lyapunov function. The forecast can be dynamically updated with the latest data available. Higher weight can be attributed to this data in determining the future prices.

The daily electricity price time series is analyzed in two layers - normal behavior and spiky behavior. Two different data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle trend and seasonality in the time series. An ARMA-based model is used to catch the linear relationship between the normal range price series and the explanatory variable, a GARCH model is used to unveil the heteroscedastic character of residuals and a neural network is applied to present the nonlinear impact of the explanatory variable on electricity prices and improve predictions based on time series techniques. The probability of a price spike occurrence and the value of a price spike are produced by a Gaussian Mixture model and K-nearest neighboring model, respectively. Forecasts of normal range prices and price spikes are generated to form an overall price forecast up to one week ahead.

Kristiansen T.,A time series spot price forecast model for the Nord Pool market,2014,16.0,We present three relatively simple spot price forecast models for the Nord Pool market based on historic spot and futures prices including data for inflow and reservoir levels. The models achieve a relatively accurate forecast of the weekly spot prices. The composite regression model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of around 7.5% and under-forecasts the actual spot price by some 1.4 NOK/MW h in the sample period. Out of sample testing achieves a MAPE of around 7.4% including a match of the actual spot price. A myopic model using the previous week's spot price as a predictor for the next week's spot price achieves a MAPE of 7.5% and under-forecasts the actual spot price by some 0.9 EUR/MW h.

Thereby, we use different mean reversion rates for ‘normal’ and ‘extreme’ (spike) periods. Furthermore, all model parameters can easily be estimated using historical data.

However, the fluctuation of electricity price depends on other commodities and there is a very complicated randomization in its evolution process. Therefore, in recent years, although large number of forecasting methods have been proposed and researched in this domain, it is very difficult to forecast electricity price with only one traditional model for different behaviors of electricity price. In this paper, we propose an optimized combined forecasting model by ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) based on the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and support vector machine (SVM) to improve the forecasting accuracy. First, both GARCH model and SVM are developed to forecast short-term electricity price of New South Wales in Australia. Then, ACO algorithm is applied to determine the weight coefficients. Finally, the forecasting errors by three models are analyzed and compared. The experiment results demonstrate that the combined model makes accuracy higher than the single models. © 2014 Yi Yang et al.",,,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article
"Chen Y., Marron J.S., Zhang J.",Modeling seasonality and serial dependence of electricity price curves with warping functional autoregressive dynamics1,2019,3.0,"Electricity prices are high dimensional, serially dependent and have seasonal variations. We propose a Warping Functional AutoRegressive (WFAR) model that simultaneously accounts for the cross time-dependence and seasonal variations of the large dimensional data. In particular, electricity price curves are obtained by smoothing over the 24 discrete hourly prices on each day. In the functional domain, seasonal phase variations are separated from level amplitude changes in a warping process with the Fisher–Rao distance metric, and the aligned (season-adjusted) electricity price curves are modeled in the functional autoregression framework. In a real application, the WFAR model provides superior out-of-sample forecast accuracy in both a normal functioning market, Nord Pool, and an extreme situation, the California market. The forecast performance as well as the relative accuracy improvement are stable for different markets and different time periods. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2019.",Karcher mean; Seasonal functional time series; Warping function,,4,1,1,1,Article

We consider a vast array of models including linear regressions, monthly dummies, sinusoidal decompositions and wavelet smoothers. We find that in terms of forecasting EEX and Nord Pool spot prices up to a year ahead, wavelet-based models significantly outperform all considered piecewise constant and sine-based models. This result challenges the traditional approach to deseasonalize spot electricity prices by fitting monthly dummies or sinusoidal functions. We also find that extending the calibration window up to four years does not improve the results; two- and especially three-year windows lead to better spot price forecasts. © 2013 IEEE.",Electricity spot price; Forecasting; Monthly dummies; Seasonality; Sinusoidal decomposition; Wavelets,Electricity spot price; Modeling and forecasting; Piece-wise constants; Seasonality; Sinusoidal functions; Spot electricity prices; Traditional approaches; Wavelets; Commerce; Decomposition; Electricity; Forecasting; Lakes; Costs,4,3,1,1,Conference

Currently, there are many techniques available for short-term electricity market clearing price (MCP) forecasting, but very little has been done in the area of mid-term electricity MCP forecasting. Mid-term electricity MCP forecasting has become essential for resources reallocation, maintenance scheduling, bilateral contracting, budgeting and planning purposes. The proposed hybrid model showed improved forecasting accuracy compared to a forecasting model using a single SVM. PJM interconnection data have been utilized to illustrate the proposed model with numerical examples. © 2013 IEEE.",Auto-regressive moving average with external input (ARMAX); deregulated electric market; electricity market clearing price (MCP); electricity price forecasting; support vector machine (SVM),Budget control; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Forecasting; Scheduling; Autoregressive moving average; Bilateral contracting; Deregulated electric markets; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; External input; Forecasting accuracy; Maintenance scheduling; Support vector machines,"4, 5",2,1,1,Conference

"Zhou H., Wu X., Wang W., Chen L.",Forecast of next day clearing price in deregulated electricity market,2009,3.0,"The daily clearing price curve in electricity market varied with multi-period and strong fluctuation characteristic. When grey GM (1, 1) model is used in forecast, the forecast error exceeded the permitted precision. This is because GM (1, 1) model is invalidated only if the price series did not follow the rule of exponential growth. In this case, grey model with period residual modification is proposed, which inherits the advantages of grey model and makes the forecasting price curve fluctuated. Meanwhile, a series of technology is used, such as smooth processing to original data, improvement of initial condition and period residual modification. Thus the fitting curve is closer to original data and the forecasting precision is improved. Simulation results verified the feasibility of the proposed approach. ©2009 IEEE.","Deregulated electricity market; Forecast of next day clearing price; Grey Model of GM (1, 1); Period residual modification; Quadric exponential smoothing omponent","Clearing price; Deregulated electricity market; Exponential smoothing; GM (1 , 1); Grey Model; Commerce; Costs; Curve fitting; Cybernetics; Data processing; Deregulation; Electric load forecasting",4,1,1,1,Conference
"Ferreira Â.P., Ramos J.G., Fernandes P.O.",A linear regression pattern for electricity price forecasting in the Iberian electricity market,2019,1.0,"The Iberian Market for Electricity resulted from a cooperation process developed by the Portuguese and Spanish administrations, aiming to promote the integration of the electrical systems of both countries. This common market consists of organised markets or power exchanges, and non-organised markets where bilateral over-the-counter trading takes place with or without brokers. Within this scenario, electricity price forecasts have become fundamental to the process of decision-making and strategy development by market participants. The unique characteristics of electricity prices such as non-stationarity, non-linearity and high volatility make this task very difficult. For this reason, instead of a simple time forecast, market participants are more interested in a causal forecast that is essential to estimate the uncertainty involved in the price. This work focuses on modelling the impact of various explanatory variables on the electricity price through a multiple linear regression analysis. The quality of the estimated models obtained validates the use of statistical or causal methods, such as the Multiple Linear Regression Model, as a plausible strategy to achieve causal forecasts of electricity prices in medium and long-term electricity price forecasting. From the evaluation of the electricity price forecasting for Portugal and Spain, in the year of 2017, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) were 9.02% and 12.02%, respectively. In 2018, the MAPE, evaluated for 9 months, for Portugal and Spain equals 7.12% and 6.45%, respectively. © 2018 Revista Facultad de Ingenieria -redin- - Todos los derechos reservados.",Forecasting; MIBEL; Regression analysis,,4,3,1,1,Article
"Zhao H., Guo S., Zhao H.",A multi-stage intelligent model for electricity price prediction based on the Beveridge-Nelson disintegration approach,2018,1.0,"Accurate electricity price prediction is key to the orderly operation of the electricity market. However, the uncertain, stochastic and fluctuant characteristics of electricity pricees make prediction difficult. With the aim of solving this issue, this investigation proposed a multi-stage intelligent model integrating the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition (B-N-D) model, the least square support vector machine (LSSVM), and a nature-inspired optimization model named the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). Firstly, the B-N-D model was utilized to decompose the hourly electricity price time series into determinacy component, periodic trend, and stochastic item. Secondly, the WOA-LSSVM model was proposed to forecast the future hourly data of three components respectively, of which the optimal parameters of LSSVM were determined by using WOA. Finally, the future hourly electricity price data were computed by multiplying the forecasted data of those terms. To verify the validity of the proposed electricity price prediction model in this paper, five comparison approaches based on the B-N-D approach were selected, which are autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), single LSSVM, LSSVM optimized by the fruit-fly optimization algorithm (FOA), LSSVM optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) models, and WOA-LSSVM without B-N-D. By comparatively analyzing the error criteria values of the above models through testing on the objective data of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) electricity market collected from 11 December 2017 to 18 December 2017, from 15 January 2018 to 22 January 2018, and from 1 February 2018 to 25 February 2018, we conclude that the constructed intelligent model in this paper can greatly enhance the prediction precision of electricity prices. © 2018 by the authors.",Beveridge-Nelson decomposition approach; Electricity price prediction; Least square support vector machine; Multi-stage intelligent model; Whale optimization algorithm,accuracy assessment; algorithm; electricity generation; electricity industry; least squares method; numerical model; optimization; prediction; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; United States; Cetacea,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article
"Borges A., Silva E.C.E., Covas R.",A longitudinal model for MIBEL energy prices,2018,1.0,"We propose to contribute to the problematic of Electricity Price Forecasting with a longitudinal statistical approach. We focus our interest on forecasting intra-day prices using hourly data (disaggregated data) in a multivariate approach rather than in the usually used univariate approach, by adjusting a mixed-effects longitudinal model to the Iberian Electricity Market hourly prices from January 1th 2015 to June 26th 2016, in a total of 13 032 observations. Results indicate that a longitudinal approach considering a mixed-effects model, with month and weekday as fixed effects, hour group as random effect and an AutoRegressive component of order 7 describing the within hour dependence, yield a model that explains the intra-day and intra-hour dynamics for the electricity hourly prices. © 2018, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

"Grossi L., Nan F.",Robust self exciting Threshold autoregressive models for electricity prices,2014,1.0,"In this paper we suggest the use of robust GM-SETAR (Self Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive) processes to model and forecast electricity prices observed on deregulated markets. The robustness of the model is achieved by extending to time series the generalized M-type (GM) estimator first introduced for independent multivariate data. As it has been shown in a very recent paper [1], the polynomial weighting function over-performs the classical ordinary least squares method when extreme observations are present. The main advantage of estimating robust SETAR models is the possibility to capture two very well-known stylized facts of electricity prices: nonlinearity produced by changes of regimes and the presence of sudden spikes due to inelasticity of demand. The forecasting performance of the model applied to the Italian electricity market (IPEX) is improved by the introduction of predicted demand as an exogenous regressor. The availability of this regressor is a particular feature of the Italian market. By means of prediction performance indexes and tests, it will be shown that this regressor plays a crucial role and that robust methods improve the overall forecasting performance of the model. © 2014 IEEE.",extreme values; GM estimator; nonlinear models; Terms-Electricity prices,Commerce; Deregulation; Estimation; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Extreme value; Forecasting performance; GM estimator; Non-linear model; Ordinary least squares methods; Prediction performance; Self-Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive models; Terms-Electricity prices; Costs,4,1,1,1,Conference
Nishikawa H.,Time series analysis of JEPX spot price with the box-Jenkins method,2007,1.0,"Following the examples of other countries, in April 2005 Japan launched wholesale electric power exchange operations as a primary item of system reform in line with electric liberalization. Only two years have passed since the initiation of these operations. However, in the summer of 2005, the surge in market prices was evident, which suggested that certain measures should be taken to confront potential market risks. Establishing a useful system for forecasting market prices through the modeling of price fluctuations in the wholesale electric market became essential. Currently, various price models are being proposed. Taking both the limited amount of data and the model's purpose into consideration, this study adopted the univariate time series model. We conducted a time series analysis on the open price indexes in the JEPX spot market with the Box-Jenkins method. Since a seven-day cycle can be observed in the data, we adopted the seasonal ARIMA model. In accordance with the procedures of the Box-Jenkins method, we determined the degree of the model's polynomial using the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation of the data and estimated the parameters of the model with the maximum likelihood method. We conducted a forecast on next day JEPX spot market prices with this time series model and examined its validity and utility as a forecasting tool. Price forecasts made with this model require only a small amount of data and will save substantial analysis work. Consequently, this method is expected to be widely used by market participants as the reference data for their bid pricing.",Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX); Market risk; Seasonal ARIMA model; Spot market; Time series analysis,Data acquisition; Electric power transmission; Marketing; Parameter estimation; Polynomial approximation; Time series analysis; Box-Jenkins method; Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX); Market risk; Cost accounting,4,1,1,1,Conference
Dash S.K.,A hybrid ARMA-Legendre polynomial neural network and evolutionary H-infinity filter for the prediction of electricity market clearing price,2015,,"A hybrid adaptive autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and Legendre polynomial neural network trained by an evolutionary H-infinity filter is presented in this paper for predicting short-Term electricity prices in a deregulated market. The proposed model comprises a linear autoregressive (AR) part and nonlinear moving average (MA) part obtained through the use of Legendre polynomial basis functions. The Legendre polynomial functional block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher dimensional space through basis functions without using any hidden layer like the multilayered perceptron (MLP) network. Instead of using the standard forward-backward (FB-LMS) algorithm for learning the weight parameters of the ARMALEG (hybrid ARMA and Legendre network) a robust H-infinity filter is used which is superior to the widely used extended Kalman filter in terms of handling uncertain noise covariances resulting in fast convergence and tracking. Further to improve the accuracy, the H-infinity filter parameters are optimised using a differential evolution (DE) strategy. The proposed method is tested on PJM electricity market and the residuals (MAPE) are compared with other forecasting methods indicating the improved accuracy of the approach and its suitability to produce a real-Time forecast.

"Monteiro C., Ramirez-Rosado I.J., Fernandez-Jimenez L.A.",Probabilistic electricity price forecasting models by aggregation of competitive predictors,2018,,"This article presents original probabilistic price forecasting meta-models (PPFMCP models), by aggregation of competitive predictors, for day-ahead hourly probabilistic price forecasting. The best twenty predictors of the EEM2016 EPF competition are used to create ensembles of hourly spot price forecasts. For each hour, the parameter values of the probability density function (PDF) of a Beta distribution for the output variable (hourly price) can be directly obtained from the expected and variance values associated to the ensemble for such hour, using three aggregation strategies of predictor forecasts corresponding to three PPFMCP models. A Reliability Indicator (RI) and a Loss function Indicator (LI) are also introduced to give a measure of uncertainty of probabilistic price forecasts. The three PPFMCP models were satisfactorily applied to the real-world case study of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). Results from PPFMCP models showed that PPFMCP model 2, which uses aggregation by weight values according to daily ranks of predictors, was the best probabilistic meta-model from a point of view of mean absolute errors, as well as of RI and LI. PPFMCP model 1, which uses the averaging of predictor forecasts, was the second best meta-model.

"Voronin S., Partanen J.","Forecasting electricity price and demand using a hybrid approach based on wavelet transform, ARIMA and neural networks",2014,43.0,"Demand and price forecasting are extremely important for participants in energy markets. Most research work in the area predicts demand and price signals separately. In this paper, a model is presented which predicts electricity demand and price simultaneously. The model combines wavelet transforms, ARIMA models and neural networks. Both time domain and wavelet domain variables are considered in the feature set for price and demand forecasting. The best input set is selected by two-step correlation analysis. The proposed model is better adapted to real conditions of an energy market since the forecast features for price and demand are not assumed as known values but are predicted by the model, thus accounting for the interactions of the demand and price forecast processes. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using data from the Finnish energy market, which is part of the Nordic Power Pool. The results show that the proposed model provides significant improvement in both demand and price prediction accuracy compared with models using a separate frameworks approach. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Energy markets; Hybrid forecast method; Price and demand forecasts; Two-step feature selection; Wavelet transform,Correlation analysis; Demand forecast; Demand forecasting; Electricity demands; Energy markets; Forecast accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Hybrid forecast method; Commerce; Forecasting; Neural networks; Wavelet transforms; Costs,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article
"Hickey E., Loomis D.G., Mohammadi H.",Forecasting hourly electricity prices using ARMAX-GARCH models: An application to MISO hubs,2012,43.0,"The recent deregulation of the electricity industry and reliance on competitive wholesale markets has generated significant volatility in wholesale electricity prices. Given the importance of short-term price forecasts in this new environment, this paper estimates and evaluates the forecasting performance of four ARMAX-GARCH models for five MISO pricing hubs (Cinergy, First Energy, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota) using hourly data from June 1, 2006 to October 6, 2007. Our empirical results reveal three important patterns: (a) electricity price volatility is regional and the optimum volatility model depends in part on the hub location, the forecast horizon, and regulated versus unregulated status of the market; (b) the APARCH model performs well in hubs in deregulated states; and (c) volatility dynamics in regulated states are better captured by a simple GARCH model and thus are less complex. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",ARMAX; Electricity; GARCH; MISO; Pricing,ARMAX; Cinergy; Electricity industry; Electricity prices; Empirical results; Forecasting performance; GARCH; GARCH models; Hub location; Illinois; Michigan; Minnesota; MISO; Price forecasts; Volatility dynamics; Wholesale electricity; Wholesale markets; Deregulation; Electricity; Forecasting; Costs; competitiveness; deregulation; electricity industry; electricity supply; empirical analysis; energy market; forecasting method; numerical model; prediction; price determination,4,"1, 2",1,1,Article
