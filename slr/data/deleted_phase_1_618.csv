"Clò S., Cataldi A., Zoppoli P.",The merit-order effect in the Italian power market: The impact of solar and wind generation on national wholesale electricity prices,2015,131.0,"Italy promoted one of the most generous renewable support schemes worldwide which resulted in a high increase of solar power generation. We analyze the Italian day-ahead wholesale electricity market, finding empirical evidence of the merit-order effect. Over the period 2005-2013 an increase of 1. GWh in the hourly average of daily production from solar and wind sources has, on average, reduced wholesale electricity prices by respectively 2.3€/MWh and 4.2€/MWh and has amplified their volatility. The impact on prices has decreased over time in correspondence with the increase in solar and wind electricity production. We estimate that, over the period 2009-2013, solar production has generated higher monetary savings than wind production, mainly because the former is more prominent than the latter. However, in the solar case, monetary savings are not sufficient to compensate the cost of the related supporting schemes which are entirely internalized within end-user tariffs, causing a reduction of the consumer surplus, while the opposite occurs in the case of wind. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity price; Feed-in tariff; Italian wholesale power market; Merit-order effect; Renewables,Commerce; Costs; Power markets; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Electricity prices; Feed-in tariff; Ordering effects; Renewables; Solar production; Supporting scheme; Wholesale electricity; Wholesale electricity markets; Electric power generation; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; power generation; price determination; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sioshansi R.,Evaluating the impacts of real-time pricing on the cost and value of wind generation,2010,112.0,"One of the costs associated with integrating wind generation into a power system is the cost of redispatching the system in real-time due to day-ahead wind resource forecast errors. One possible way of reducing these redispatch costs is to introduce demand response in the form of real-time pricing (RTP), which could allow electricity demand to respond to actual real-time wind resource availability using price signals. A day-ahead unit commitment model with day-ahead wind forecasts and a real-time dispatch model with actual wind resource availability is used to estimate system operations in a high wind penetration scenario. System operations are compared to a perfect foresight benchmark, in which actual wind resource availability is known day-ahead. The results show that wind integration costs with fixed demands can be high, both due to real-time redispatch costs and lost load. It is demonstrated that introducing RTP can reduce redispatch costs and eliminate loss of load events. Finally, social surplus with wind generation and RTP is compared to a system with neither and the results demonstrate that introducing wind and RTP into a market can result in superadditive surplus gains. © 2010 IEEE.",Power system economics; Real-time pricing; Unit commitment; Wind forecast errors; Wind power generation,Power system economics; Real time pricing; Unit commitments; Wind forecast errors; Wind forecasts; Cost reduction; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Errors; Integration; Internet protocols; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Electric load forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zugno M., Morales J.M., Pinson P., Madsen H.",Pool strategy of a price-maker wind power producer,2013,100.0,"We consider the problem of a wind power producer trading energy in short-term electricity markets. The producer is a price-taker in the day-ahead market, but a price-maker in the balancing market, and aims at optimizing its expected revenues from these market floors. The problem is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and cast as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which can be solved employing off-the-shelf optimization software. The optimal bid is shown to deliver significantly improved performance compared to traditional bids such as the conditional mean or median forecast of wind power distribution. Finally, sensitivity analyses are carried out to assess the impact on the offering strategy of the producer's penetration in the market, of the correlation between wind power production and residual system deviation, and of the shape of the forecast distribution of wind power production. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Electricity markets; mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints; offering strategies; price-maker; wind power,Electricity market; Forecast distribution; Mathematical program with equilibrium constraints; Mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints; Mixed integer linear program; offering strategies; price-maker; Wind power distribution; Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Integer programming; Optimization; Wind power; Weather forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Hobbs B.F., Hu M.-C., Iñón J.G., Stoft S.E., Bhavaraju M.P.",A dynamic analysis of a demand curve-based capacity market proposal: The PJM reliability pricing model,2007,81.0,"Because of high generation adequacy standards in the power industry, some peaking capacity operates for a limited time during the year and may not receive sufficient energy revenues to meet its fixed costs. This is particularly true when energy prices are capped in order to mitigate market power. The northeastern U.S. independent system operators (ISOs) have responded to this issue by establishing capacity obligations for loads and markets for installed capacity, thus providing a capacity revenue stream to generators. The installed capacity (ICAP) markets in the northeastern U.S. markets are a response to this need for additional incentives to construct generation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has accepted the PJM Interconnection's (PJM) proposal to replace the present fixed ICAP requirement that is placed upon load serving entities (LSEs) with a demand curve-based system in which the ISO would be responsible for acquiring ""residual"" capacity on behalf of LSEs. The demand curve approach pays more when reserve margins are smaller and provides a reduced incentive for investment when installed reserves are above the target. Another goal is to make revenues more predictable for generators, making investment less costly and, ultimately, lowering prices for consumers. A dynamic representative agent model is presented for projecting effects upon reserve margins, generator profitability, and consumer costs and is applied to alternative demand curves proposed for the PJM market. The consumer costs resulting from a sloped demand curve are robustly lower compared to the present fixed requirement under a wide range of assumptions concerning behavior of generation owners, including risk attitudes, bidding behavior, and willingness to build capacity as a function of forecast profit. The cost savings arise from lower capital costs to generators due to reduced risk and risk premiums. Also, average installed capacity is less for the same level of reliability because of reduced fluctuations in installed reserves. © 2007 IEEE.",Economics; Power generation economics; Power generation peaking capacity,Costs; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Forecasting; Industrial economics; Investments; Marketing; Mathematical models; Reliability theory; Independent system operators; Power generation economics; Power generation peaking capacity; Reliability pricing model; Electric power systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fanone E., Gamba A., Prokopczuk M.",The case of negative day-ahead electricity prices,2013,79.0,"In recent years, Germany has significantly increased its share of electricity produced from renewable sources, which is mainly due to the Renewable Energy Act (EEG). The EEG substantially impacts the dynamics of intra-day electricity prices by increasing the likelihood of negative prices. In this paper, we present a non-Gaussian process to model German intra-day electricity prices and propose an estimation procedure for this model. Most importantly, our model is able to generate extreme positive and negative spikes.

Rathmann M.,Do support systems for RES-E reduce EU-ETS-driven electricity prices?,2007,75.0,"Support systems for electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) can reduce electricity prices which have also been influenced by a CO2 emission trading scheme (ETS): Additional RES-E substitutes electricity from fossil fuels, and thus CO2-emissions are reduced. The demand for emission reductions is lowered, as a result the CO2-price is also reduced. Consequently the wholesale price for electricity decreases. However, most RES-E support systems are financed via the electricity market, which increases the retail electricity price. An assessment for Germany shows that retail electricity prices in the first trading period of the EU-ETS 2005-2007 are lowered by 2.6 Euro / MWh due to additional RES-E. Considering the complete EU, the effect is substantially higher. This paper describes the effect and the influence of different policy designs. It develops an approach for assessing the effect and applies it for the case of Germany and roughly estimates the effect for the EU. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Kumar M.D.,Impact of electricity prices and volumetric water allocation on energy and groundwater demand management: Analysis from Western India,2005,75.0,"In recent years, power tariff policy has been increasingly advocated as a mean to influence groundwater use and withdrawal decisions of farmers in view of the failure of existing direct and indirect regulations on groundwater withdrawal in India. Many researchers argue that pro rata electricity tariff, with built in positive marginal cost of pumping could bring about efficient use of the resource, though some argue that the levels of tariff in which demand becomes elastic to pricing are too high to be viable from political and socio-economic points of view. The paper presents a theoretical model to analyze farmers' response to changes in power tariff and water allocation regimes vis à vis energy and groundwater use. It validates the model by analyzing water productivity in groundwater irrigation under different electricity pricing structures and water allocation regimes. Water productivity was estimated using primary data of gross crop inputs, cost of all inputs, and volumetric water inputs. The analysis shows that unit pricing of electricity influences groundwater use efficiency and productivity positively. It also shows that the levels of pricing at which demand for electricity and groundwater becomes elastic to tariff are socio-economically viable. Further, water productivity impacts of pricing would be highest when water is volumetrically allocated with rationing. Therefore, an effective power tariff policy followed by enforcement of volumetric water allocation could address the issue of efficiency, sustainability and equity in groundwater use in India. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

"Ford A., Vogstad K., Flynn H.",Simulating price patterns for tradable green certificates to promote electricity generation from wind,2007,74.0,"This article uses computer simulation to anticipate the price dynamics in a market for Tradable Green Certificates (TGCs). These markets have been used in Europe to promote generation of electricity from renewable resources like wind. Similar markets have been proposed in the United States of America (USA) where the certificates are called Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). The certificates are issued to the generating companies for each megawatt-hour of renewable electricity generation. The companies may sell the certificates in a market, and the revenues from certificate sales provide an extra incentive to invest in new generating capacity. Proponents argue that this market-based incentive can be designed to support government mandates for a growing fraction of electricity generation from renewable sources. In the USA, these mandates are set by the states and are known as Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). We simulate the price dynamics of a market designed to support an aggressive mandate for wind generation in the northwestern USA. The simulations show that the certificate price climbs rapidly to the cap in the early years after the market opens. Investors then react to these high prices with construction of new wind capacity. After a few years, wind generation meets, and then exceeds the requirement. We show that this pattern appears again and again when the simulations are repeated with wide variations in the estimates of behavioral parameters. We use the model to study the impact of different trading strategies by the wind companies and by the distribution companies. We also study the simulated market response if the USA adopts the carbon allowance market envisioned in The Climate Stewardship Act. The article concludes with recommendations for policy makers involved in TGC market design. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Benini M., Marracci M., Pelacchi P., Venturini A.",Day-ahead market price volatility analysis in deregulated electricity markets,2002,69.0,"The electricity market experiences pronounced short term volatility due to its peculiarities, first of all continuos load variations associated to the impossibility to profitably store electric energy. Electricity price forecast is extremely important for all market players and in particular for generating companies, that must manage their units, and the associated economic risk, in the short, medium and long term. In general, price volatility depends on a large number of parameters such as: fuel prices (often related to currency exchange rates), availability of generating units, hydro generation production, demand elasticity and variations, network congestion and management rules of any specific electricity market. This study provides an analysis of day-ahead spot market price volatility in Spain, California, UK and PJM markets. Electricity prices for the years 1999 and 2000 have been used for the study.

Centolella P.,The integration of Price Responsive Demand into Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) wholesale power markets and system operations,2010,68.0,"A number of states and utilities are pursuing demand response based on dynamic and time-differentiated retail prices and utility investments in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), often as part of Smart Grid initiatives. These developments could produce large amounts of Price Responsive Demand, demand that predictably responds to changes in wholesale prices. Price Responsive Demand could provide significant reliability and economic benefits. However, existing RTO tariffs present potential barriers to the development of Price Responsive Demand. Effectively integrating Price Responsive Demand into RTO markets and operations will require changes in demand forecasting, scarcity pricing reform, synchronization of scarcity pricing with capacity markets, tracking voluntary hedging by price responsive loads, and a non-discriminatory approach in curtailments in capacity emergencies.

"López-Lezama J.M., Contreras J., Padilha-Feltrin A.",Location and contract pricing of distributed generation using a genetic algorithm,2012,65.0,"This paper presents an approach based on a specialized genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the location and contract pricing of dispatchable distributed generation (DG) units in distribution systems. The proposed approach is based on a nonlinear bilevel programming framework that involves the interests of two different agents: the DG owner who procures the maximization of the profits obtained from the energy sales, and the Distribution Company (DisCo), which procures the minimization of the payments incurred in attending the forecasted demand. To meet the forecasted demand the DisCo can purchase energy either from the wholesale energy market or from the DG units within its network. The proposed GA determines both the location and contract pricing of the DG units that would render maximum profits to the DG owner, subject to the minimization of payments procured by the DisCo. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, several tests were carried out on a modified IEEE 34-bus and 85-bus distribution networks. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Finn P., Fitzpatrick C., Connolly D., Leahy M., Relihan L.",Facilitation of renewable electricity using price based appliance control in Ireland's electricity market,2011,64.0,"Abstract Ireland's share of electricity generated from RES-E (renewable energy sources) is due to increase from 14.4% in 2009 to 40% in 2020. With this target predominantly fulfilled with wind generated electricity, the need for increased grid flexibility to facilitate this intermittent energy source is becoming ever more significant. As smart metering becomes available, demand side participation will be one option for achieving this flexibility. Using an immersion heated hot water tank as an example, this paper examines the impact that price optimised load scheduling has on the facilitation of wind generated electricity. To replicate real-world data availability, optimisation is performed using day-ahead predicted prices while the results are calculated using final prices and metered generation data. The results demonstrate a correlation between the day-ahead predicted half-hourly price of electricity and real-time wind availability. This supports the use of price as a means of providing an incentive for load response in order to increase the amount of renewable energy that can be facilitated on the electrical grid. Furthermore, various thermal storage efficiencies were examined for the device to reveal that as the energy loss rate of the device is reduced, the financial savings increase, wind generation increases, and conventional generation decreases. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Demand side management; Real-time pricing; Wind energy,Costs; Electricity; Energy dissipation; Heat storage; Water tanks; Wind power; Appliance controls; Conventional generation; Demand side managements; Demand-side; Electrical grids; Electricity market; Energy-loss rate; Financial savings; Hot water tanks; Hourly prices; Intermittent energy source; Ireland; Load response; Load scheduling; Optimisations; Price-based; Real time pricing; Real world data; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Smart metering; Thermal storage; Wind energy; Wind generation; Electric generators; data assimilation; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy market; energy resource; optimization; renewable resource; wind power; Ireland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pirrong C., Jermakyan M.",The price of power: The valuation of power and weather derivatives,2008,59.0,"Pricing contingent claims on power presents numerous challenges due to (1) the unique behavior of power prices, and (2) time-dependent variations in prices. We propose and implement a model in which the spot price of power is a function of two state variables: demand (load) and fuel price. In this model, any power derivative price must satisfy a PDE with boundary conditions that reflect capacity limits and the non-linear relation between load and the spot price of power. Moreover, since power is non-storable and demand is not a traded asset, the power derivative price embeds a market price of risk. Using inverse problem techniques and power forward prices from the PJM market, we solve for this market price of risk function. During 1999-2001, the upward bias in the forward price was as large as $50/MWh for some days in July. By 2005, the largest estimated upward bias had fallen to $19/MWh. These large biases are plausibly due to the extreme right skewness of power prices; this induces left skewness in the payoff to short forward positions, and a large risk premium is required to induce traders to sell power forwards. This risk premium suggests that the power market is not fully integrated with the broader financial markets. © 2008.",Derivatives pricing; Electricity markets; Inverse techniques; Market price of risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Li F., Bo R.",Congestion and price prediction under load variation,2009,56.0,"In market-based planning and operation, it is very useful to have the information of generation dispatch, congestion, and price as load increases. Therefore, it is beneficial to system planners if the congestion or locational marginal pricing (LMP) versus load is readily available. This can certainly be obtained by repetitively running an optimization model at different load levels. However, this approach is too brute-force to be practical. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is proposed to identify the new binding constraint and the new marginal unit set when the system load increases from the present load level. It addresses the challenge of step changes in generation dispatch when a generation or transmission limit becomes binding. The algorithm also gives the new sensitivity of the new marginal units. Therefore, the generation dispatch, congested lines, and LMP at a new critical load level (CLL) can be easily calculated. Test results are presented in matrix formulation to clearly demonstrate and verify the proposed algorithm. Since the proposed approach is based on linearized model, it should be particularly suitable for short-term planning or operation, although application to long-term planning is also possible. © 2009 IEEE.",Congestion management; Critical load level (CLL); Energy markets; Generation sensitivity; Locational marginal pricing (LMP); Optimal power flow (OPF); Power markets,Congestion management; Critical load level (CLL); Energy markets; Generation sensitivity; Locational marginal pricing (LMP); Optimal power flow (OPF); Power markets; Acoustic generators; Binding energy; Commerce; Costs; Electric load flow; Optimization; Power electronics; Loads (forces),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By estimating a Markov regime-switching model, we find that the relation between the EUA price and its fundamentals varies over time. In particular, we are able to identify a low and a high volatility regime, both showing a strong impact of the fundamentals on the EUA price. The most important EUA price drivers are changes on the stock market and energy prices. The gas price and a broad European equity index affect the EUA price positively in both regimes, while the coal price and the oil price have a significant, but also positive impact only during the high and the low volatility regime, respectively. The high volatility regime is predominant in phases when economic activities are on a decrease or when institutional changes harm the confidence in the stringency of the EU ETS.

"Rider M.J., Paucar V.L.",Application of a nonlinear reactive power pricing model for competitive electric markets,2004,50.0,"A methodology for calculating active and reactive power marginal prices is proposed. Attention is given to the reactive power marginal price in a competitive electric market. The formulation adopts a synchronous generators steady-state model with nonlinear reactive power limits. Total cost of reactive power production (CRPP) is represented as a nonlinear model that considers the corresponding economic loss if active power is not generated; that cost is the opportunity cost. The formulation includes the CRPP of the static compensators. The methodology has been implemented using a modified optimal power flow program that includes a sequential linear programming technique enhanced with a modified predictor-corrector interior-point method. The IEEE-30, -57, -118 systems and a reduced configuration of the interconnected (South-Southeast) Brazilian system have been used for application of the methodology.

"Jiang Z., Tan J.",How the removal of energy subsidy affects general price in China: A study based on input-output model,2013,46.0,"In China, most energy prices are controlled by the government and are under-priced, which means energy subsidies existing. Reforming energy subsidies have important implications for sustainable development through their effects on energy price, energy use and CO2 emission. This paper applies a price-gap approach to estimate China's fossil-fuel related subsidies with the consideration of the external cost. Results indicate that the magnitude of subsidies amounted to CNY 1214.24 billion in 2008, equivalent to 4.04% of GDP of that year. Subsidies for oil products are the largest, followed by subsidies for the coal and electricity. Furthermore, an input-output model is used to analyze the impacts of energy subsidies reform on different industries and general price indexes. The findings show that removal of energy subsidies will have significant impact on energy-intensive industry, and consequently push up the general price level, yet with a small variation. Removing oil products subsidies will have the largest impact, followed by electricity, coal and natural gas. However, no matter which energy price increases, PPI is always the most affected, then GDP deflator, with CPI being the least. Corresponding compensation measures should be accordingly designed to offset the negative impact caused by energy subsidies reform. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Energy prices; Energy subsidies; Input-output model,Compensation measures; Energy intensive industries; Energy prices; Energy subsidies; External costs; Input output model; Price-gap approaches; Small variations; Carbon dioxide; Costs; energy efficiency; energy market; fossil fuel; Gross Domestic Product; input-output analysis; numerical model; price determination; price dynamics; subsidy system; sustainable development; China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study builds on the existing literature by employing a data series that includes a sample period of institutional change and recently developed unit root testing procedures. Besides crude oil, natural gas and coal prices are also examined, aiming to further the knowledge of non-renewable energy resource time paths in order to inform future research and update the conclusions of past studies. The unit root tests allow for structural breaks and are based on the procedures developed by Zivot and Andrews (1992), Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) and Lee and Strazicich (2003). Finally, we investigate whether the trend changes signs in the regimes which are bounded by the structural breaks and quantify the prevalence of the trends over the sample period considered. The results show that the trend is not well represented by a single positive or negative trend. The variability of the trend suggests that forecasting energy prices should not typically occur about a single trend. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Energy prices; Structural breaks; Trends,Data series; Energy prices; Institutional change; Non-renewable energy resources; Policy makers; Structural break; Trends; Unit root; World energies; Coal deposits; Coal research; Costs; Crude oil; Natural gas deposits; Time series; Renewable energy resources; commodity price; energy market; energy resource; structural adjustment; trend analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The result is robust to consideration of energy intensity by industry. The effect is greater for high growth firms. It must be emphasized that the direct effect of uncertainty is not estimated. Conditional variance of energy price is obtained from a GARCH model. Findings suggest that stability in energy prices would be conducive to greater stability in firm-level investment. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.,Energy intensity; Energy price uncertainty; Firm investment; GMM-IV,Capital stock; Conditional variance; Energy intensity; Energy prices; Error correction models; Firm investment; GARCH models; GMM-IV; High growth; Manufacturing firms; Sales growth; Costs; Industry; Sales; Uncertainty analysis; Investments; energy market; error correction; investment; numerical model; price dynamics; stock market; uncertainty analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lam P.-L.,Pricing of electricity in China,2004,43.0,"In China, the State Power Corporation (SPC) was the dominant producer and supplier of electric power. Our price estimation results based on published data of the SPC indicate that short run cost factors, like fuel costs and investment expenditure, were more important in the price determination process. Although the power purchase prices paid by the SPC to independent power producers (IPPs) have already covered capital costs, capital costs of generation and transmission assets owned by the SPC were ignored in the process. Our studies indicate that electricity prices in China were highly subsidized and below the average total costs of generation and transmission. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Price J.E.,Market-based price differentials in zonal and LMP market designs,2007,42.0,"The California ISO is redesigning procedures for scheduling, dispatch, and congestion management, which are critical to reliable, nondiscriminatory transmission service. The redesign implements Security Constrained Unit Commitment and Locational Marginal Pricing to reflect actual costs of delivering energy, using an accurate network model to price both congestion and losses. CAISO simulations of the market redesign are a unique opportunity to compare a) estimated LMPs if the redesign were in place during recent historical periods with b) actual conditions, as logged in operating records. The study uses market schedules and bids in an Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow simulation. Resulting LMPs are similar within current congestion zones, but price differences occur during high loads, reflecting actual changes in system conditions. The frequency and magnitude of LMP differences are consistent with the current market, suggesting that the increased market transparency will produce stable, predictable prices. Case studies demonstrate that optimization using SCUC and SCED, coupled with the state estimator, allows more appropriate responses to system conditions, improved utilization of transmission capacity, reduction in congestion costs, and enhanced system reliability. © 2007 IEEE.",Electricity market; Electricity supply industry; Losses; Marginal pricing; Network losses; Networks; Optimization; Power markets; Power systems; Pricing,Computer simulation; Electric load flow; Electric load management; Electric power transmission; Electric rates; Electric utilities; Optimization; Electricity market; Marginal pricing; Network losses; Electric industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Woo C.-K., Horowitz I., Hoang K.",Cross hedging and forward-contract pricing of electricity,2001,41.0,"We consider the problem of an electric-power marketer offering a fixed-price forward contract to provide electricity that it purchases from a potentially volatile and unpredictable fledgling spot energy market. One option for the risk-averse marketer who wants to hedge against the spot-price volatility is to engage in cross hedging to reduce the contract's profit variance, and to determine the forward-contract price as a risk-adjusted price - the sum of a baseline price and a risk premium. We show how the marketer can estimate the spot-price relationship between two wholesale energy markets for the purpose of cross hedging, as well as the optimal hedge and the forward contract's baseline price and risk premium. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

"Bolinger M., Wiser R.",Understanding wind turbine price trends in the U.S. over the past decade,2012,40.0,"On a $/kW basis, wind turbine prices in the U.S. have declined by nearly one-third on average since 2008, after having previously doubled over the period from 2002 through 2008. These two substantial and opposing trends over the past decade - and particularly the earlier price doubling - run counter to the smooth, gradually declining cost trajectories predicted by standard learning curve theory. Taking a bottom-up approach, we examine seven possible drivers of wind turbine prices in the U.S., with the goal of estimating the degree to which each contributed to the doubling in turbine prices from 2002 through 2008, as well as the subsequent decline in prices through 2010. In aggregate, these seven drivers - which include changes in labor costs, warranty provisions, manufacturer profitability, turbine scaling, raw materials prices, energy prices, and foreign exchange rates - explain from 70% to 90% (depending on the year) of empirically observed wind turbine price movements in the U.S. through 2010. Turbine scaling is found to have been the largest single contributor to the price doubling through 2008, although the incremental cost of scaling has been justified by greater energy capture, resulting in a lower cost of wind generation. © 2011.",Cost trends; Learning curves; Wind turbines,Bottom up approach; Declining costs; Energy capture; Energy prices; Foreign exchange rates; Incremental cost; Labor costs; Learning curve theory; Learning curves; Lower cost; Price movement; Price trends; Run counters; Wind generation; Cost accounting; Employment; Profitability; Wages; Wind turbines; Costs; bottom-up approach; energy market; exchange rate; price dynamics; wind turbine; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just S., Weber C.",Pricing of reserves: Valuing system reserve capacity against spot prices in electricity markets,2008,40.0,"This paper models the interdependencies between markets for secondary reserve capacity and spot electricity to derive the pricing of reserves under equilibrium conditions. Starting with the indifference condition between offering in both markets, the reservation price is derived from the opportunity cost consideration and the unit commitment conditions in a fundamental interrelated market framework. The reserve market examined compares widely to the German market for secondary reserves, but the general approach may also be used to investigate other reserve markets. The approach explores and formalizes the influence of reserve capacity on the spot market supply function. A numerical solution procedure is provided to this non-trivial case of market interaction.

In this paper, we extend previous work by considering a more realistic adversary model that is not arbitrarily tied to scaling and delay attacks, but that can generate any arbitrary pricing signal and show how to keep the problem tractable with a new analysis based on sensitivity functions. In addition, we extend previous work by proposing countermeasures to mitigate the negative impact of these attacks.

"Woo C.K., Zarnikau J., Moore J., Horowitz I.",Wind generation and zonal-market price divergence: Evidence from Texas,2011,39.0,"The extant literature on wind generation and wholesale electricity spot prices says little about how wind generation may affect any price differences between two inter-connected sub-markets. Using extensive data from the four ERCOT zones of Texas, this paper develops a two-stage model to attack the issue. The first stage is an ordered-logit regression to identify and quantify, for example, the impact of wind generation in the West zone on the estimated probability of a positive or negative price difference between the North and West zones. The second stage is a log-linear regression model that identifies and quantifies the estimated impact of wind generation on the sizes of those positive and negative price differences. It is shown that high wind generation and low load in the wind-rich ERCOT West zone tend to lead to congestion and zonal price differences, that those differences are time-dependent, and that other factors such as movements in nuclear generation and natural-gas prices, as well as fluctuating non-West zone loads, also play a role. The results have broad implications for energy policy makers that extend well beyond the borders of Texas and, indeed, those of the United States. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",ERCOT; Wind energy; Zonal-market price difference,Energy policy makers; ERCOT; High winds; Low load; Nuclear generation; Price difference; Regression model; Time-dependent; Two stage model; Wholesale electricity; Wind energy; Wind generation; Zonal prices; Zonal-market price difference; Commerce; Energy policy; Linear regression; Wind power; Costs; electricity generation; energy market; energy policy; price dynamics; regression analysis; wind power; Texas; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Li K., Fang L., He L.",How population and energy price affect China's environmental pollution?,2019,37.0,"This paper examines the impact of population and energy price on China's environmental pollution through both industrial and residential channels. Our theoretical models reveal that the influences of population on environmental pollution are contingent on wage stickiness and wage elasticity. We also predict that environment pollution decreases with rising energy price, but downward energy price distortion intensifies environmental pollution. We test these hypotheses using panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2001 to 2016 and employing both constant coefficient and time-varying coefficient panel data models to conduct analyses. Our empirical results show that population growth, increased urbanization, and energy price distortion all intensify environmental pollution, while population aging and rising energy price tend to alleviate environmental pollution. Our results also reveal significant regional and time heterogeneity on the impact of population factors and energy price on China's environmental pollution. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",China; Energy price distortion; Environmental pollution; Population; Urbanization,Pollution; Wages; China; Energy prices; Environmental pollutions; Population; Urbanization; Population statistics; empirical analysis; energy market; energy policy; environmental quality; panel data; price dynamics; urban population; urbanization; wage determination; China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The algorithms introduced in Part I of this paper are simulated assuming 20% and 50% wind capacity. We show that the look-ahead dispatch of the proposed method is physically implementable and, when used with elastic demand, can accommodate the integration of close to 50% wind capacity. This is contrasted with the observation that, without elastic demand, 50% wind integration is not physically implementable. From the perspective of total market surplus, the predictive dispatch of the proposed method is 3.8% suboptimal when compared to the centralized most efficient predictive economic dispatch.

In order to do this, the SO has to provide enough power reserves which can be provided on the basis of bilateral contracts or on the relevant competitive market. In this paper, several methods for the power-reserve pricing of frequency control are presented. These methods are well suited to small power systems, where an insufficient number of potential bidders makes an ancillary-services market difficult to organize.

"Swider D.J., Weber C.",Bidding under price uncertainty in multi-unit pay-as-bid procurement auctions for power systems reserve,2007,36.0,"In this paper a methodology for profit maximized bidding under price uncertainty in a day-ahead, multi-unit and pay-as-bid procurement auction for power systems reserve is proposed. Within this novel methodology a bidder is considered to follow a Bayes-strategy. Thereby, one bidder is assumed to behave strategically and the behavior of the remaining is summarized in a probability distribution of the market price and a reaction function to price dumping by the strategic bidder. With this approach two problems arise: First, as a pay-as-bid auction is considered, no uniform price and therefore no single probability distribution of the market price is readily available. Second, if historic bidding data of all participants are used to estimate such a distribution and market power is a relevant factor, the bid of the strategically behaving bidder is likely to influence the distribution. Within this paper for both of the problems solutions are presented. It is shown that by estimating a probability of acceptance the optimal bidding price with respect to a given capacity can be calculated by maximizing a stochastic non-linear objective function of expected profit. Taking the characteristics of recently established markets in Germany into account, the methodology is applied using exemplary data. It is shown that the methodology helps to manage existing price uncertainties and hence supports the trading decisions of a bidder. It is inferred that the developed methodology may also be used for bidding on other auction markets with a similar market design. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"Li Y., Flynn P.C.",Deregulated power prices: Comparison of volatility,2004,34.0,"We examine electrical power price variability for 14 deregulated markets. Power price volatility is measured by price velocity, the daily average of the absolute value of price change per hour. Deregulated markets show a wide variability in price velocity. Some price velocity is expected and arises from the daily diurnal price pattern, which differs significantly between markets. Even when the expected daily variability in price is removed, the residual unexpected variability differs between markets. Some deregulated markets, most notably Britain and Spain, show patterns that are predictable and consistent and have low values of unexpected price velocity. These markets create a climate conducive to consumers facing the market through real time pricing and shaping consumption behaviors in response to price changes. Other markets, for example, South Australia and Alberta, have patterns that are inconsistent and irregular, and hence are hard for a customer to interpret; a customer in such a market will have a higher incentive to avoid demand side management and escape risk through hedging mechanisms. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The value of many of these instruments depends directly on electricity prices. In theory, the wholesale price in a real-time market should reflect the short-run marginal cost, However, most markets are not perfectly competitive, therefore by understanding the degree of correlation between price and physical drivers, electric traders and consumers can manage their risk more effectively and efficiently. Market data from two power-pool architectures, both pre-2003 ISO-NE and Australia's NEM, have been studied. The dynamic character of electricity price is mean-reverting, and consists of intra-day and weekly variations, seasonal fluctuations, and instant jumps. Parts of them are affected by load demands. Hourly signals on both price and load are divided into deterministic and random components with a discrete fourier transform algorithm. Next, the real-time price-load relationship for periodic and random signals is examined. In addition, time-varying volatility models are constructed on random price and random load with the GARCH (1,1) model, and the correlation between them analysed.

The goal is to increase the overall profit of the portfolio by reducing imbalances and, consequently, their implicit penalty in a two-price balancing market for electricity. We investigate two different operational strategies, which differ in whether the CHP plant and the wind farm are operated jointly or independently, and we evaluate their economic performance on a real case study based on a CHP-wind system located in the western part of Denmark. We present a comprehensive mathematical model for describing the different heat and power production units of the CHP plant and suggest different ways of determining its operation in a setup with two trading floors: a day-ahead market and a balancing market. We build a simulation framework that runs in a rolling-horizon fashion, so that forecasts for heat demand, wind power production, and market prices are updated at each iteration. We conclude that the portfolio strategy is the most profitable due to the two-price structure of the balancing market. This encourages producers to handle their imbalances outside the market. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Balancing market; combined heat and power (CHP); electricity market; optimal portfolio operation; wind power,Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Power markets; Profitability; Wind power; Balancing market; Combined heat and power plants; Day ahead market; Economic performance; Operational strategies; Portfolio strategies; Simulation framework; Wind power production; Cogeneration plants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Li H., Han Z.",Manipulating the electricity power market via jamming the price signaling in smart grid,2011,32.0,"While enhancing the efficiency and agility to the power system, the communication infrastructure in smart grid also incurs vulnerabilities to the reliability of the power market and power grid. A novel attacking scheme is proposed, in which an attacker jams the signaling of power price and then ceases jamming when the power price has been significantly changed. The power users jammed by the attacker will make a rapid response to the changed power price, whose change direction can be predicted by the attacker. Then, the attacker can manipulate the price in the power market and thus makes profit. The abrupt change of power consumption will also cause a significant impact on the power grid stability. The effect of such an attack will be discussed both analytically and numerically. A countermeasure for this attack is also proposed. © 2011 IEEE.",,Communication infrastructure; Electricity power markets; Power grid stability; Power grids; Power markets; Power price; Power users; Rapid response; Significant impacts; Smart grid; Commerce; Jamming; Power quality; Profitability; Smart power grids; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sarkar V., Khaparde S.A.",DCOPF-based marginal loss pricing with enhanced power flow accuracy by using matrix loss distribution,2009,32.0,"On current days, many of the power markets are adopting the practice of marginal loss pricing. The dc optimal power flow (DCOPF) model is still mostly used for the purpose of market clearing owing to its simplicity, robustness and higher speed of convergence. Within the DCOPF framework, transmission line losses are represented as additional external loads on the system. In the classical DCOPF model of marginal loss pricing, as implemented in the New England market, the aggregated network loss is distributed over the system nodes in a fixed ratio. To gain more design flexibility in the distribution of system losses, a matrix loss distribution (MLD) framework is developed in this paper maintaining compatibility with financial transmission rights. In MLD, each individual line is considered separately for the purpose of loss distribution. The ratio in which the power loss in a certain line is distributed can be different from that in which the power loss in another line is distributed. The additional design flexibility thus obtained assists in making a more accurate representation of the power flow. The benefit of MLD is illustrated through a case study. An energy reference independent application of MLD is also suggested. © 2009 IEEE.",Estimation-based loss distribution; Financial transmission rights; Locational marginal price; Marginal loss pricing; Matrix loss distribution; Power flow accuracy; Revenue adequacy; Vector loss distribution,Financial transmission rights; Locational marginal price; Marginal loss pricing; Matrix loss distribution; Power flow accuracy; Revenue adequacy; Commerce; Economics; Electric load flow; Light transmission; Power electronics; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zhang X., Wang J., Gao Y.",A hybrid short-term electricity price forecasting framework: Cuckoo search-based feature selection with singular spectrum analysis and SVM,2019,30.0,"Under the liberalization and deregulation of the power industry, price forecasting has become a cornerstone for market participants' decision-making such as bidding strategies and purchase plans. However, the exclusive nonlinearity dynamics of electricity price is a challenge problem that largely affects forecasting accuracy. To address this task, this paper presents a hybrid forecasting framework for short-term electricity price forecasting by exploiting and mining the important information hidden in the electricity price signal. Moreover, a hybrid feature selection method (HFS) is introduced into the forecasting strategy. To exhibit the dynamical characteristics of electricity price, we primarily perform a singular spectrum analysis (SSA)-based systematic analysis process by using the merit of SSA and analyzing the multiple seasonal patterns of short-term electricity price series, providing a meaningful representation of the hidden patterns and time-varying volatility of electricity price series. Aiming at selecting the key features, the candidate variables are constructed considering the dynamic behavior of price series; further, to capture the optimal features from the candidates, the correlation threshold θ is defined for the adjustable parameters in HFS and optimally determined by the intelligent search algorithm. Additionally, triangulation based on the Pearson, Spearman and Kendall rank correlation coefficient is performed to strengthen the reliability of the proposed method. The proposed hybrid forecasting framework is validated in the New South Wales electricity market, which demonstrates that the developed approach is truly better than the benchmark models used and a reliable and promising tool for short-term electricity price forecasting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Hybrid feature selection; Hybrid forecasting; Key features; Price forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis,Commerce; Decision making; Deregulation; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Optimization; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Hybrid feature selections; Hybrid forecasting; Key feature; Price forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis; Power markets; algorithm; correlation; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; price dynamics; spectral analysis; support vector machine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rise in real energy price reduces the degree of persistence in the investment adjustment cost function. Panel results suggest that in manufacturing a 1% rise in real energy price reduces investment by a country's firms by 1.9% relative to that by firms in other countries with a smaller effect for non-manufacturing firms. The negative effect of a higher relative price of energy on firm-level investment is significantly less marked the larger the firm. Results imply that stabilizing the relative price of energy would steady firm investment with greater gains in stability at smaller and medium sized firms. Results are robust to consideration of country business cycle effect and firm leverage. Estimation of investment is based on the Euler equation approach with over 21,000 observations.

"Pandey S.N., Tapaswi S., Srivastava L.",Nodal congestion price estimation in spot power market using artificial neural network,2008,29.0,"In the world wide increasing trend of restructured power system, open access in transmission system and competition in generation and distribution have introduced a frequently occurring problem of congestion. To establish a proficient price-based congestion management procedure, the nodal pricing strategy is found to be appropriate. From congestion management point of view, the optimal nodal prices are comprised of two basic components. First component is locational marginal price, that is marginal cost of generation to supply load and transmission losses both. Second component is nodal congestion price (NCP), that is the charges to maintain network security. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm based neural network (LMANN) for estimating NCPs in spot power market by dividing the whole power system into various congestion zones is presented. Euclidian distance based clustering technique has been applied for feature selection before employing LMANN. The purpose of using artificial neural network (ANN) based approach for NCP estimation in spot power market is to exploit the tolerance for any missing or partially corrupted data to achieve tractability, robustness and very fast solution. The proposed ANN method also handles the congestion price volatility by taking continuously varying load and constrained transmission into account. The information provided by the proposed method regarding the formation of different congestion zones and the severity of congestion within a zone instructs both the market participants as well as independent system operator in making effective decisions. The proposed method has been examined for an RTS 24-bus system and is found to be quite promising. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2008.",,Algorithms; Cost accounting; Electric power systems; Problem solving; Robustness (control systems); Congestion price estimation; Nodal congestion price (NCP); Nodal pricing strategy; Neural networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Genc T.S., Sen S.",An analysis of capacity and price trajectories for the Ontario electricity market using dynamic Nash equilibrium under uncertainty,2008,28.0,"This paper studies investments in the Ontario Electricity Market which is currently being restructured. Our methodology is based on the concept of S-adapted open-loop Nash equilibrium. We examine the evolution of capital investments and pricing behavior of suppliers as uncertain electricity demand evolves over time (in Ontario). This study is particularly interesting since we compare the implications of two policies: (i) the current setting in which Ontario Power Generation (OPG) retains its generation units; (ii) the policy (set up in 2003) that required the divestiture of the largest supplier, OPG, and aimed to increase the number of independent suppliers in Ontario. We mainly focus on the independent generators like Bruce Nuclear. We use the tools of Stochastic Programming to compute the S-adapted open-loop Nash equilibrium market outcomes. We find that in the three-player market total capacity installation and market prices are higher than the ones in the five-player market. That is higher capacity may not necessarily alleviate exercise of market power. We also confirm the prediction by the National Energy Board that in a market with five major players, OPG's market share may reduce to a percentage between 35% and 40%. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate significant changes in the operation of heat generation units in DH systems as a response to future electricity price profile with a, relative to today, high yearly average electricity price and more frequent high-electricity-price periods. The observed changes include a 20% decrease in heat generation from heat pumps (HP) and an increase of up to 25% in heat generation from combined heat and power (CHP) plants, owing to a switch in the merit order of these two technologies. We show that large fluctuations in the electricity price lead to an increased value being placed on CHP plants with variable power-to-heat ratio. The results indicate that with reoccurring high-electricity-price periods the value of sold electricity alone can become high enough to motivate investment in CHP plants, i.e. indicating that the generation and selling of heat from CHP plants may not be the core business in the future. Furthermore, there are additional opportunities for increased value of both CHP plants and HPs for time periods of less than 48 h, given that such short duration periods can be identified in a reasonable time in advance, i.e. dependent on, for instance, wind power forecasts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Combined heat and power (CHP); District heating (DH); Flexibility; Heat pumps (HP); Modelling; Optimisation,Cogeneration plants; Costs; Heat generation; Heat pump systems; Heating; Integer programming; Investments; Models; Wind power; Combined heat and power; District heating system; Electricity price fluctuation; Flexibility; Heat pumps; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimisations; Wind power forecast; District heating; business; combined heat and power; cost analysis; energy market; heat production; investment; linear programing; modeling; numerical model; operations technology; optimization; price dynamics; pump; wind power; Goteborg; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland; Chandipura virus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gharesifard B., Başar T., Domínguez-García A.D.",Price-based coordinated aggregation of networked distributed energy resources,2016,27.0,"In this paper, we introduce a framework for studying the aggregated response for energy provision/consumption processes by distributed energy resources (DERs) that are physically connected to an electric power distribution network. In this framework, there is a set of agents referred to as aggregators that participate in a real-time energy market by submitting offers to sell, or bids to buy, a certain amount of energy at some price. To realize an offer or a bid, an aggregator interacts with a set of DERs and incentivizes them to produce (or consume) energy via some pricing strategy. In order to make a decision on whether or not to sell or buy energy, each DER uses the pricing information provided by the aggregator it is associated with, and some estimate of the average (or total) energy that neighboring DERs are willing to sell or buy, computed through some exchange of information among them through a cyber network; the topology of this cyber network is described by a connected undirected graph. The focus of this paper is on the DER strategic decision-making process, which we cast as a game with a single aggregator. In this context, we provide sufficient conditions on the aggregator's pricing strategy under which this game has a unique Nash equilibrium. Then, we propose a distributed algorithm that enables the DERs to seek this Nash equilibrium; this algorithm relies on simple computations using local information acquired through exchange of information with neighboring DERs. We illustrate our results through several numerical simulations. © 2015 IEEE.",Distributed energy resources; Distributed generation control; Distributed Nash seeking; Networked systems,Computation theory; Costs; Decision making; Electric power distribution; Game theory; Networked control systems; Sales; Topology; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed Nash seeking; Exchange of information; Local information; Networked systems; Pricing strategy; Strategic decision making; Undirected graph; Energy resources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gullì F., Balbo A.L.",The impact of intermittently renewable energy on Italian wholesale electricity prices: Additional benefits or additional costs?,2015,27.0,"Most studies of the literature find that the development of renewable energy sources determines a decrease in the wholesale prices. Some authors use this finding to state that the current subsidies for renewable technologies cannot be considered as excessive. By carrying out a hybrid analysis (both simulation and ex-post empirical analyses) of the case of photovoltaic energy in Italy, this article demonstrates that this result cannot be generalised. Under market power, an increase in PV production can provide benefits in terms of a wholesale price decrease only beyond a specific threshold and especially if combined with other effects. Otherwise, it is likely that PV development could imply an increase in prices. Therefore, on the one hand, caution is necessary when using the estimated change in wholesale prices to evaluate the net cost for consumers of the supporting policies for renewables: either the simulation-based models or the full empirical analyses may be misleading. On the other hand, if ""decarbonisation"" is the main objective, the energy policies should be designed in order to assure a deep and balanced penetration of the clean technologies, regardless of their estimated transitory impact on wholesale prices (and in the meantime reviewing the organisation of power markets). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity; Market power; Prices; Renewable,Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Electricity; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Market Power; Photovoltaic energy; Prices; Renewable; Renewable energy source; Renewable technology; Simulation-based models; Wholesale electricity; Costs; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; photovoltaic system; price dynamics; renewable resource; Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mathaba T., Xia X., Zhang J.",Analysing the economic benefit of electricity price forecast in industrial load scheduling,2014,26.0,"The current trend of electricity market deregulation ushers in increasingly dynamic electricity pricing schemes. The cost-optimal scheduling of industrial loads with accurate price forecasts is therefore important. However, results in the current literature suggest that mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is poor at indicating the economic benefit of a forecast. This paper presents the economic benefit analysis of electricity price forecast on the day-ahead scheduling of load-shifting industrial plants. A coal-conveying system with storage is used as a case study. The research uses three price forecasting methods on the PJM's market prices over a period of two years. Rank correlation (RC) between the predicted price and the actual price is proposed as an indicator of economic benefit. The results show that RC is a better indicator of economic benefit than root mean square error (RMSE) and MAPE. They also show that potential economic benefit obtainable from forecasts depends on price volatility and not mean price. An artificial forecast is used to validate the superiority of RC over MAPE and RMSE. It is observed that the predictability of a forecast's economic benefit is largely dependent on how responsive the load is to electricity price changes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Conveyor belt system; Day-ahead scheduling; Demand-side management; Electricity cost optimization; Price forecast; Rank correlation,Belt conveyors; Coal storage; Costs; Electric utilities; Electricity; Forecasting; Industrial plants; Mean square error; Scheduling; Conveyor belt system; Day-ahead scheduling; Demand side managements; Electricity costs; Price forecasts; Rank correlation; Electric load forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rubin O.D., Babcock B.A.",The impact of expansion of wind power capacity and pricing methods on the efficiency of deregulated electricity markets,2013,26.0,"The remarkable expansion of global wind power capacity in many countries brings forward several key economic questions regarding the performance of impacted electricity markets. Wind forecast uncertainties and rules that penalize scheduling deviations often discourage wind energy producers from participating in day-ahead electricity markets. Instead, wind energy commonly is priced either in the real-time balancing market or via a Feed-in-tariff (FIT) arrangement. In this paper we extend a recently developed equilibrium modeling approach to examine how the integration of wind energy impacts premiums in day-ahead electricity markets. In particular, we compare premiums as wind power capacity expands for different pricing mechanisms. By considering operational costs related to ramping conventional generators we are able to characterize the efficient level of premium needed to cope with the intermittent nature of wind. We find that the way that wind energy is priced is critical. We show that in the presence of imperfect competition pricing wind energy in the market increases firms' ability to extract oversized day-ahead premiums while in the case of market-independent FIT, market power is reduced as wind power capacity expands. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Cournot competition; Day-ahead premium; Deregulated electricity markets; Feed-in-tariff; Wind energy,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Weather forecasting; Conventional generators; Cournot competition; Day-ahead; Day-ahead electricity market; Deregulated electricity market; Equilibrium modeling; Feed-in tariff; Imperfect competition; Wind power; competition (economics); cost-benefit analysis; deregulation; electricity supply; energy efficiency; numerical model; pricing policy; renewable resource; tariff structure; wind power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Saxena A., Soni B.P., Kumar R., Gupta V.",Intelligent Grey Wolf Optimizer – Development and application for strategic bidding in uniform price spot energy market,2018,25.0,"Restructuring of power system has enabled generating companies to sell the power in energy markets. To avail maximum profit, every generating company frame strategies and bid in competitive energy markets. Prediction of rival behavior and information of future energy price is a major difficulty, while exercising the profit making strategies. A powerful optimization tool is required to handle the profit maximization process in dynamically changing market; keeping this fact in consideration, a new variant of Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) named as Intelligent Grey Wolf Optimizer (IGWO) is proposed. This variant employs two mathematical frameworks first an efficient sinusoidal truncated function and another one is oppositional based learning concept for ensuring the better exploration and exploitation properties. The accuracy of IGWO is tested and compared with other contemporary algorithms on 22 benchmark functions. Once proved, the proposed algorithm is applied for framing bidding strategy in uniform and dynamically changing market conditions. The results of IGWO are compared with GWO, oppositional-GWO (OGWO) and PSO. The rivals behaviors are modeled through normal distribution of the bids and two cost models are prepared. Further, Monte Carlo simulations are performed. It is observed that profit obtained from IGWO is more from OGWO, GWO and PSO for both a single trading hour and a trading day. A considerable amount of profit can be earned by a generation company by employing proposed methodology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Bidding strategies; Electricity market; Grey wolf optimization; Market clearing price; Monte Carlo simulation,Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Functions; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Normal distribution; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Bidding strategy; Contemporary algorithms; Development and applications; Exploration and exploitation; Generating companies; Generation companies; Market Clearing Price; Mathematical frameworks; Power markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Huang X., Hong S.H., Li Y.",Hour-Ahead Price Based Energy Management Scheme for Industrial Facilities,2017,25.0,"Price-based demand response (PBDR) offers a significant opportunity for electricity consumers to dynamically balance their energy demand in response to time-varying electricity prices, and therefore ease the burden on the grid during peak times. However, despite being the primary energy consumers, there is little research carried out on implementing PBDR in industrial facilities, especially on real-time price (RTP) based DR. In this study, we propose a DR scheme based on hour-ahead RTP for industrial facilities. The scheme implements an artificial neural network based price forecasting model to forecast unknown future prices to support global time horizon optimization. Based on the forecasting price, the energy cost minimization problem is formulated by mixed integer linear programming. This paper includes a practical case study of the whole process of steel powder manufacturing for performance analysis. The results show that the proposed scheme is capable of balancing the energy demand and reducing energy costs while satisfying production targets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Artificial neural network (ANN); demand response (DR); hour-ahead real-time price (HA-RTP); industrial facilities; price forecasting,Energy management; Forecasting; Industrial research; Integer programming; Neural networks; Power markets; Demand response; Electricity consumers; Energy management schemes; Industrial facilities; Mixed integer linear programming; Price forecasting; Real-time price; Time-varying electricity prices; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gaudard L., Gabbi J., Bauder A., Romerio F.",Long-term Uncertainty of Hydropower Revenue Due to Climate Change and Electricity Prices,2016,25.0,"Hydropower represents the world’s largest renewable energy source. As a flexible technology, it enhances reliability and security of the electricity system. However, climate change and market liberalization may hinder investment due to the evolution of water runoffs and electricity prices. Both alter expected revenue and bring uncertainty. It increases risk and deters investment. Our research assesses how climate change and market fluctuation affect annual revenue. But this paper focuses on the uncertainty, rather than on forecasting. This transdisciplinary topic is investigated by means of a mixed method, i.e. both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative approach uses established models in natural sciences and economics. The uncertainty is accounted for by applying various scenarios and various datasets coming from different models. Based on those results, uncertainty is discussed through an analysis discerning three dimensions of uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis requires the assessment of a large panel of models and data sets. It is therefore rarely carried out. The originality of the paper also lies on the combination of quantitative established models with a qualitative analysis. The results surprisingly show that the greenhouse gas scenarios may in fact represent a low source of uncertainty, unlike electricity prices. Like forecasting, the main uncertainties are actually case study related and depend on the investigated variables. It is also shown that the nature of uncertainty evolves. Runoff uncertainty goes from variability, i.e. inherent randomness, to epistemic, i.e. limitation of science. The reverse situation occurs with the electricity price. The implications for scientists and policy makers are discussed. © 2016, The Author(s).",Electricity market liberalization; Mixed methodology; Mountain hydrology; three-dimensional uncertainty,Climate change; Commerce; Costs; Economics; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Runoff; Flexible technologies; Market fluctuations; Market liberalization; Mixed methodology; Mountain hydrology; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative approach; Renewable energy source; Uncertainty analysis; alternative energy; climate change; commodity price; electricity industry; hydroelectric power; investment; renewable resource; runoff; uncertainty analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Anbazhagan S., Kumarappan N.",A neural network approach to day-ahead deregulated electricity market prices classification,2012,24.0,"This paper proposes a day-ahead electricity price classification that could be realized using three-layered feed forward neural network (FFNN), cascade-forward neural network (CFNN) trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The electricity price classification method is as an alternative to numerical electricity price forecasting due to high forecasting errors in various approaches. These electricity price classifications are important because all market participants do not know the exact value of future prices in their decision-making process. In this paper, various electricity market price classification classes with respect to pre specified electricity price thresholds are used. The simulation results show that the proposed CFNN method provides a robust and accurate method for day-ahead deregulated electricity market price classification classes.

"van de Ven D.J., Fouquet R.",Historical energy price shocks and their changing effects on the economy,2017,23.0,"The purpose of this paper is to identify the changes in the impact of energy shocks on economic activity — with an interest in assessing if an economy's vulnerability and resilience to shocks improved with economic development. Using data on the United Kingdom over the last three hundred years, the paper identifies supply, aggregate demand and residual shocks to energy prices and estimates their changing influence on energy prices and GDP. The results suggest that the impacts of supply shocks rose with its increasing dependence on coal, and declined with its partial transition to oil. However, the transition from exporting coal to importing oil increased the negative impacts of demand shocks. More generally, the results indicate that improvements in vulnerability and resilience to shocks did not progress systematically as the economy developed. Instead, the changes in impacts depended greatly on the circumstances related to the demand for and supply of energy sources. If these experiences are transferable to future markets, a transition to a diversified mix of renewable energy is likely to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to energy price shocks. © 2017 The Authors",Demand shocks; Economic impact; Energy prices; Long run; Supply shocks,Costs; Economics; Demand shocks; Economic impacts; Energy prices; Long run; Supply shocks; Economic and social effects; demand elasticity; economic activity; economic development; economic impact; energy market; price dynamics; vulnerability; United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Malakar T., Goswami S.K., Sinha A.K.",Impact of load management on the energy management strategy of a wind-short hydro hybrid system in frequency based pricing,2014,23.0,"In the post restructuring era of electrical power system, each of the generating farm or utility has its own business strategy in terms of generation planning, load management and for other decisions. The basic objective of the utility is to maximize the operational profit for a given period of time. Generation scheduling for a utility with wind farm largely depends on the accuracy of wind power prediction. Therefore, it is important to explore the suitability of load management approach in coordination with the use of energy storage facility to compensate the uncertainty in wind power generation. This paper focuses mainly the operating strategy of a grid connected small hybrid power system to maximize its profit by adopting coordination between load management technique and utilization of storage plant under frequency based pricing. The optimum load scheduling has been implemented to utilities own local load. An hourly-discretized optimization algorithm is proposed and solved using artificial bee colony algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the optimization problem is solved for varied wind power scenarios with different demand expectations cases in a day ahead Indian electricity market. It is noted that the proposed load management approach results more profit for the hybrid system because of better power management compared to the case when load scheduling has not been incorporated. The solution of the proposed optimization algorithm gives the strategies to be followed by the hybrid system how to operate its pump storage unit and to serve its local load in next hours. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Huisman R., Kiliç M.",A history of European electricity day-ahead prices,2013,22.0,"In this article, we examine the development of day-ahead prices in five European markets which became more connected over recent years. Where previous studies examined the convergence of price levels over time, we focus on patterns in estimates for the parameters in a switching regimes model. This makes it possible to distinguish between prices under normal market conditions and under non-normal market conditions, those market conditions that can cause extreme price spikes. We expect that increased connectivity yields additional supply in the short-term and therefore will reduce the impact of price spikes. Our results indicate that the impact of price spikes and volatility decreased over time, that prices behave more random, and that the parameter estimates between various connected markets seem to have converged between the Belgian, Dutch, French, German and Nordic day-ahead markets over the years 2003 through 2010.

"Sato M., Dechezleprêtre A.",Asymmetric industrial energy prices and international trade,2015,20.0,"This paper measures the response of bilateral trade flows to differences in industrial energy prices across countries. Using a rich panel dataset with 42 countries, 62 manufacturing sectors over 16 years (1996-2011) and covering 60% of global merchandise trade, we estimate the short-run effects of sector-level energy price asymmetry on trade. We find that changes in relative energy prices have a statistically significant but very small impact on imports. On average, a 10% increase in the energy price difference between two country-sectors increases imports by 0.2%. The impact is larger for energy-intensive sectors. Even in these sectors, however, the magnitude of the effect is such that changes in energy price differences across time explain less than 0.01% of the variation in trade flows.

"Luoma J., Mathiesen P., Kleissl J.",Forecast value considering energy pricing in California,2014,19.0,"In this study, production forecast value is investigated using day-ahead market (DAM) and real-time market (RTM) locational marginal prices (LMP) at 63 sites in California. Using the North American Mesoscale (NAM) Model, day-ahead global horizontal irradiance (GHI) forecasts are established and converted to power assuming that a 1. MW solar photovoltaic plant is co-located at each observation site. Using this forecast, energy is hypothetically sold in the DAM. As the RTM occurs, deviations between forecast and observation are settled by hypothetically purchasing or selling energy at the RTM price. Total revenue is calculated by the sum of these two transactions. Comparison of NAM forecast revenue to perfect day-ahead forecast revenue shows that perfect forecast revenue is always greater. However, yearly NAM forecast revenue is as much as 98% of the perfect forecast revenue for some sites. After a bias-correction is applied to NAM forecasts, NAM forecast revenue decreases. This demonstrates that based on the observed DAM-RTM price spread, biased forecasts can have a higher forecast value than more accurate forecasts. However, when a deviation penalty is assessed, the most accurate forecasts always yield the highest total revenue. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Energy market; Energy prices; Forecast value; Solar energy,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Solar energy; Bias correction; Day ahead market; Energy markets; Energy prices; Locational marginal prices; Production forecasts; Real-time market; Solar photovoltaic plants; Forecasting; accuracy assessment; economic analysis; energy policy; forecasting method; numerical model; photovoltaic system; pricing policy; real time; solar power; California; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bichler M., Shabalin P., Ziegler G.",Efficiency with linear prices? A game-theoretical and computational analysis of the combinatorial clock auction,2013,19.0,"Combinatorial auctions have been suggested as a means to raise efficiency in multi-item negotiations with complementarities among goods because they can be applied in procurement, energy markets, transportation, and the sale of spectrum auctions. The combinatorial clock (CC) auction has become very popular in these markets for its simplicity and for its highly usable price discovery, derived by the use of linear prices. Unfortunately, no equilibrium bidding strategies are known. Given the importance of the CC auction in the field, it is highly desirable to understand whether there are efficient versions of the CC auction providing a strong game theoretical solution concept. So far, equilibrium strategies have only been found for combinatorial auctions with nonlinear and personalized prices for very restricted sets of bidder valuations. We introduce an extension of the CC auction, the CCC auction, and show that it actually leads to efficient outcomes in an ex post equilibrium for general valuations with only linear ask prices. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the worst case efficiency of the CC auction, which highlights situations in which the CC leads to highly inefficient outcomes. As in other theoretical models of combinatorial auctions, bidders in the field might not be able to follow the equilibrium strategies suggested by the game-theoretical predictions. Therefore, we complement the theoretical findings with results from computational and laboratory experiments using realistic value models. The experimental results illustrate that the CCC auction can have a significant impact on efficiency compared to the CC auction. © 2013 INFORMS.",Allocative efficiency; Combinatorial auction; Electronic market,Clocks; Commerce; Costs; Allocative efficiency; Combinatorial auction; Computational analysis; Electronic market; Equilibrium bidding strategies; Laboratory experiments; Theoretical solutions; Worst-case efficiency; Game theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the option of selling or buying electric power at spot market prices is included in unit commitment decisions, the optimal solution of a UCP with M units under standard operating and load constraints can be obtained by solving M uncoupled sub-problems. We account for the volatility of the spot market price of electricity by using a stochastic model. The model incorporates both the stochastic features of the availabilities of generating units participating in the market and the uncertainty of the aggregate load.

"Li Y., Flynn P.C.",Deregulated power prices: Comparison of diurnal patterns,2004,18.0,"We examine electrical power price, and in particular its daily and average weekday vs. weekend pattern of change, for 14 deregulated markets. Power price in deregulated markets shows fundamentally different patterns. North American markets show a monotonic diurnal weekday price pattern, while all other markets studied show more than one price peak. Deregulated power markets differ in maximum vs. minimum daily average price and in average weekday to weekend price, in turn creating a different incentive for a consumer to time shift power consuming activities. Markets differ in the extent to which a small fraction of the days shapes the average diurnal pattern and value of price. Deregulated markets show a wide variation in the correlation between load and price. Some deregulated markets, most notably Britain and Spain, show patterns that are predictable and consistent, and hence that can encourage a customer to shape consumption behaviors. Other markets, for example South Australia, have patterns that are inconsistent and irregular, and hence are hard for a customer to interpret; a customer in such a market will have a higher incentive to escape risk through hedging mechanisms. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The proposed model is based on data from southern Norway and the result is a model estimating the regulating prices using the estimated regulating volumes. The resulting model makes it possible to estimate regulating market prices under changing conditions, like those occurring when different national markets are integrated. © 2009 IEEE.",Norwegian regulating power market; Regulating market integration; Regulating prices and volumes; Time series analysis,Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Long term; Long term study; Modelling process; National markets; Regulating market; Regulating market integration; Regulating power; Short term; Southern Norway; Statistical models; Statistical properties; Costs; Time series; Time series analysis; Commerce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ritz R.A.,Price discrimination and limits to arbitrage: An analysis of global LNG markets,2014,16.0,"Gas prices around the world vary widely despite being connected by international trade of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Some industry observers argue that major exporters have acted irrationally by not arbitraging prices. This is also difficult to reconcile with a competitive model in which regional price differences exist solely because of transport costs. We show that a model which incorporates market power can rationalize observed prices and trade flows. We highlight how different features of the LNG market limit the ability and/or incentive of other players to engage in arbitrage, including constraints in LNG shipping. We also present some rough estimates of market power in short-term sales by Qatar (to Japan and the UK), and discuss the potential impact of US LNG exports. © 2014.",International trade; Limits to arbitrage; Market power; Natural gas; Price discrimination,Costs; International trade; Natural gas; Natural gas; Competitive models; Limits to arbitrage; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Market Power; Potential impacts; Price difference; Price discrimination; Transport costs; LNG markets; Liquefied natural gas; International trade; competitiveness; gas production; gas supply; international trade; liquefied natural gas; price determination; price dynamics; trade flow; energy market; export; incentive; numerical model; Japan; Qatar; United Kingdom; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"O'Mahoney A., Denny E.",Electricity prices and generator behaviour in gross pool electricity markets,2013,16.0,"Electricity market liberalisation has become common practice internationally. The justification for this process has been to enhance competition in a market traditionally characterised by statutory monopolies in an attempt to reduce costs to end-users. This paper endeavours to see whether a pool market achieves this goal of increasing competition and reducing electricity prices. Here the electricity market is set up as a sealed bid second price auction. Theory predicts that such markets should result with firms bidding their marginal cost, thereby resulting in an efficient outcome and lower costs to consumers. The Irish electricity system with a gross pool market experiences among the highest electricity prices in Europe. Thus, we analyse the Irish pool system econometrically in order to test if the high electricity prices seen there are due to participants bidding outside of market rules or out of line with theory. Overall we do not find any evidence that the interaction between generator and the pool in the Irish electricity market is not efficient. Thus, the pool element of the market structure does not explain the high electricity prices experienced in Ireland. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Auction theory; Electricity markets; Multiple regression analysis,Auction theory; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Electricity system; Market structures; Multiple regression analysis; Pool electricity market; Second-price auction; Commerce; Electric industry; Electricity; Lakes; Regression analysis; Costs; competition (economics); electricity supply; energy market; monopoly; multiple regression; price dynamics; Ireland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We introduce a new methodology to predict long-term electricity market prices consisting of two parts: (1) a self-developed form of Porter’s five forces analysis (PFFA) determining that electricity markets are characterized by a fairly steady price increase. Dominant driving factors come out to be: (i) uncertainty of future electricity prices; (ii) regulatory complexity; and (iii) generation overcapacities. Similar conclusions derive from (2) a self-developed form of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). In this case, we find that the electricity market particularly depends on (i) market liberalization and (ii) the European Union (EU)’s economy growth. The applied methodologies provide a novel contribution in forecasting electricity price trends, by analyzing the sentiments, expectations, and knowledge of industry experts, through an assessment of factors influencing the market price and goals of key market participants. An extensive survey was conducted, interviewing experts all over Europe showed that the electricity market is subject to a future slight price increase. © 2018 by the authors.",Electricity market price; Europe; Forecast; Long term; Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Porter’s five forces analysis,Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Decision theory; Electric industry; Forecasting; Operations research; Power markets; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity prices; Europe; Forecasting electricity; Industry experts; Long term; Market liberalization; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Deregulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article tries to solve the problems of traditional nodal pricing methods to be able to consider opportunity and availability costs for the generators. A modified model of generators reactive power production cost has been used in OPF objective function considering normal and contingency conditions. Availability cost would be estimated considering the volume of network demand from the generators in contingency states through probability calculations. This cost would be paid to all the units that possibly will needed to produce reactive power in contingency states. Purvey of required availability of generation units to deal with emergency conditions, encouraging providers to invest in critical areas in the network and fair distribution of reactive power production costs over several producers are some advantages of the proposed method.

It gives an economic opportunity to renewable energy-based distributed generation, such as photovoltaic, small hydro or wind, as it can build a bridge to the integration of renewable resources in the wholesale electricity market. In this market, changes in the offers of portfolio electricity technologies affect wholesale electricity prices, since marginal generation costs are transmitted through to the wholesale market. This paper investigates the impact of energy-based distributed generation technologies composition on wholesale electricity prices variations of different EU energy markets by using a Maximum Entropy Econometric estimation procedure.

"Chellam S., Kalyani S.",Power flow tracing based transmission congestion pricing in deregulated power markets,2016,14.0,"The objective of this paper is to propose a simple transmission congestion pricing scheme based on tracing principle by considering generator fixed cost, cost for incurring loss and transmission congestion cost. Restructuring has brought about considerable changes by the virtue of which electricity is now a commodity and has converted into deregulated type. Such a competitive market has paved way for innumerable participants. This concept of restructuring has led to overloading of transmission lines. In this paper, power flow tracing has been employed by using suitable optimization algorithm, where the real power generation has been maximized. Congestion in the transmission line has been produced in a new fashion by maximizing the real power demand. The power flow under normal operating condition and congestion is determined and hence the difference in power flow is estimated. Based on the estimated power flow difference, the transmission line congestion cost is computed. Pool model and bilateral model has been considered in simulation study to introduce the concept of deregulation. The proposed method is tested and validated on Modified IEEE 30 bus test system and Indian utility 69 bus test system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"He Y., Wang B., Wang J., Xiong W., Xia T.",Correlation between Chinese and international energy prices based on a HP filter and time difference analysis,2013,14.0,"To establish a reasonable system and mechanism for Chinese energy prices, we use the Granger causality test, Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter and time difference analysis to research the pricing relationship between Chinese and international energy prices. We find that Chinese and international crude oil prices changed synchronously while Chinese refined oil prices follow the changes of international oil prices with the time difference being about 1 month to 2 months. Further, Australian coal prices Granger causes Chinese coal prices, and there is a high correlation between them. The U.S. electricity price is influenced by the WTI crude oil price, the U.S. gasoline price and the HenryHub gas price. Due to the unreasonable price-setting mechanism and regulation from the central government, China's terminal market prices for both electricity and natural gas do not reflect the real supply-demand situation. This paper provides quantitative results on the correlation between Chinese and international energy prices to better predict the impact of international energy price fluctuations on China's domestic energy supply and guide the design of more efficient energy pricing policies. Moreover, it provides references for developing countries to improve their energy market systems and trading, and to coordinate domestic and international energy markets. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Energy prices; HP filter; Time difference analysis,Central government; Electricity prices; Energy prices; Granger causality test; Hodrick-prescott filters; HP filter; Quantitative result; Time-differences; Commerce; Crude oil; Developing countries; Energy policy; Costs; crude oil; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy market; Granger causality test; price dynamics; pricing policy; China; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Janssen M., Wobben M.",Electricity pricing and market power-evidence from Germany,2009,14.0,"The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology for measuring the exercise of potential market power in liberalized electricity markets. We therefore investigate producer behavior in the context of electricity pricing with respect to fundamental time-dependent marginal cost (TMC), i.e., CO 2- and fuel cost. In doing so, we do not-in contrast to most current approaches to market power investigation-rely on an estimate of the entire generation cost, which inevitably suffers from the lack of appropriate available data. Applying an analytical model of a day-ahead electricity market, we derive work-on rates, which provide information about the impact of TMC variations on electricity prices in the market constellations of perfect competition, quasi-monopoly, and monopoly. Comparing these model-based work-on rates with actual work-on rates, estimated by an adjusted first-differences regression model of German power prices on the cost for hard coal, natural gas, and emission allowances, we find evidence of the exercise of market power in the period 2006-2008. However, our results reveal that German market competitiveness increases marginally. We confirm our results by simulating a TMC-driven diffusion model of futures power prices estimated by maximum-likelihood.

Other variables such as forecasted load in utility and fuel availability may also be uncertain. In the paper, an optimisation procedure that models uncertainties using fuzzy numbers is presented. The proposed method defines the range of control variables (local generations and imports) for satsifying operational constraints with a total operation cost lower than a predefined goal. Price of imported power, local generation as well as line flows and loads are defined as linguistic variables and represented with fuzzy numbers. The fuzzy optimisation is transformed into a classical (crisp) optimisation problem by considering a degree of acceptance for each constraint. The problem is formulated with a linear objective function and nonlinear constraints. An iterative procedure is used to compute the minimum operation cost. An example system is used to show applications of the proposed method in the decision-making process inherent in uncertain environments. © IEE, 1997.",Electric power systems; Fuzzy mathematics; Nonlinear optimisation,Constraint theory; Costs; Decision making; Electric generators; Electric utilities; Fuzzy sets; Iterative methods; Optimization; Short term power purchases; Electric power systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our answer comprises the following findings that capture the interdependence of ERCOT's energy and AS products: (1) the DAM energy price increases with the day-ahead forecasts of natural gas price, system load and AS requirements but declines with nuclear and wind generation's forecasts; (2) the AS prices increase with the DAM energy price and the AS procurement forecasts but decline with the AS offer forecasts; and (3) the RTM energy price increases with the DAM energy price but diverges from the DAM energy price due to forecasting errors related to the DAM energy price's fundamental drivers. These findings imply that Texas can reduce the prices for day-ahead energy, day-ahead AS and real-time energy via wind generation development and demand-side-management. Further, Texas can improve its electricity trading efficiency by improving ERCOT's forecast accuracy to narrow the RTM energy price's divergence from the DAM energy price. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Ancillary services; D44; D47; Day-ahead market; Electricity products; ERCOT; G13; G14; Q41; Real-time market,Commerce; Costs; Dams; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Natural gas; Ancillary service; Day ahead market; Electric reliability council of texas; Electricity trading; ERCOT; Forecast accuracy; Real-time market; Wholesale electricity; Power markets; electricity generation; electricity supply; forecasting method; market conditions; price determination; real time; Texas; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gürtler M., Paulsen T.",The effect of wind and solar power forecasts on day-ahead and intraday electricity prices in Germany,2018,13.0,"This study analyzes the effects of wind and solar power generation forecasts on electricity prices. Converse to the existing empirical literature in this area, we apply a panel data analysis to control for endogeneity due to unobserved heterogeneity. We use a dataset with 24 daily observations of day-ahead and intraday prices from 2010 to 2016, and we apply a fixed effects regression under consideration of robust Driscoll-Kraay standard errors. A noteworthy element of the regression model is the simulation-based design of a variable indicating the power generation technology that is price-determining at a certain point in time. In this context, we differentiate between the fuel types coal, gas, and others, to model the nonlinear price behavior for a varying demand. For 2016, we find price dampening effects of both wind and solar power of approximately 0.6 €/MWh per additional GWh of feed-in. Along with the rapidly increasing shares of wind and solar power of the total power generation during the last years, their price dampening effect has declined since 2013, due to a drop in fuel prices. Another finding is that a reduction in forecasting errors on the power generation from wind and solar, and smoothing of the cyclical demand would lead to a decreased price volatility. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Forecasting errors; Merit-order effect; Ramping costs; Renewable energy sources; Solar; Wind,Errors; Forecasting; Power markets; Regression analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind; Forecasting error; Ordering effects; Ramping costs; Renewable energy source; Solar; Costs; alternative energy; cost analysis; electricity generation; forecasting method; price dynamics; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moshiri S., Martinez Santillan M.A.",The welfare effects of energy price changes due to energy market reform in Mexico,2018,13.0,"Despite being a large energy producer and exporter, Mexico may soon become a net total energy importer due to a decline in oil reserves and increasing domestic consumption. To increase efficiency in the energy market, Mexican authorities approved a constitutional amendment aiming to open the state-run energy markets to competition in 2013. The reform is expected to raise efficiency and to lower energy prices in the long run. However, it will take some time for the new institutional arrangements to settle and the reform objectives to materialize. The removal of subsidies, which is expected to take place after the reform, will also raise prices particularly in the short run. In this paper, we analyze the effect of likely energy price changes due to energy market reform on household consumption and welfare in different income groups. We estimate the QUAIDS model using the nonlinear SURE method and the Mexican household budget surveys for the period 2002–2012 to obtain elasticities. The results show great heterogeneity in elasticities across energy types and income groups. Specifically, energy demand is elastic with respect to income, but changes in prices have mixed effects among energy types. The welfare effect of the price changes on low-income households will be 9 times stronger than that on the mid-income households and 18 times on and the high-income households. This warrants a compensation package to make the reform socially acceptable. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Elasticities; Energy; Household budget; Market reform; Mexico; Welfare,Budget control; Commerce; Costs; Elasticity; Petroleum deposits; Power markets; Proven reserves; Energy; Household budget; Market reform; Me-xico; Welfare; Energy efficiency; demand elasticity; energy market; energy use; household energy; price dynamics; welfare impact; Mexico [North America],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use multi-scale correlation analysis based on a modified method of time-dependent intrinsic correlation and the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise for this purpose. Three hypotheses on the type and strength of correlations in the short-, medium- and long-runs were tested. It is shown that price zones significantly differ in internal price-demand correlation structure over the comparable time scales, and not each of the theoretically formulated hypotheses is true for each of them. We can conclude that the answer to the question whether it is necessary to take into account the influence of demand-side on electricity spot prices over different time scales, is significantly dependent on the structure of electricity generation and consumption on the corresponding market. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity demand; Electricity spot price; Empirical mode decomposition; Price-demand correlation; Time-dependent intrinsic correlation; Trend estimation,Commerce; Correlation methods; Costs; Electric industry; Time measurement; Demand correlation; Electricity demands; Electricity spot price; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Time dependent; Trend estimation; Power markets; correlation; demand elasticity; demand-side management; electricity; electricity generation; energy market; price dynamics; trend analysis; Russian Federation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cortazar G., Kovacevic I., Schwartz E.S.",Expected commodity returns and pricing models,2015,13.0,"Stochastic models of commodity prices have evolved considerably in terms of their structure and the number and interpretation of the state variables that model the underlying risk. Using multiple factors, different specifications and modern estimation techniques, these models have gained wide acceptance because of their success in accurately fitting the observed commodity futures' term structures and their dynamics. It is not well emphasized however that these models, in addition to providing the risk neutral distribution of future spot prices, also provide their true distribution. While the parameters of the risk neutral distribution are estimated more precisely and are usually statistically significant, some of the parameters of the true distribution are typically measured with large errors and are statistically insignificant. In this paper we argue that to increase the reliability of commodity pricing models, and therefore their use by practitioners, some of their parameters - in particular the risk premium parameters - should be obtained from other sources and we show that this can be done without losing any precision in the pricing of futures contracts. We show how the risk premium parameters can be obtained from estimations of expected futures returns and provide alternative procedures for estimating these expected futures returns. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Commodities; Futures; Oil,Contracts; Costs; Estimation; Parameter estimation; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Stochastic systems; Alternative procedures; Commodities; Commodity futures; Commodity pricing; Estimation techniques; Futures; Oil; Risk-neutral distribution; Stochastic models; commodity price; energy market; oil; pricing policy; reliability analysis; risk factor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present an analytical framework to quantify LMP sensitivity with respect to changes in sensor data. This framework consists of a unified LMP sensitivity matrix subject to sensor data corruption. This sensitivity matrix reflects a coupling among the sensor data, an estimation of the power system states, and the real-time LMP. The proposed framework offers system operators an online tool to: 1) quantify the impact of corrupted data at any sensor on LMP variations at any bus; 2) identify buses with LMPs highly sensitive to data corruption; and 3) find sensors that impact LMP changes significantly and influentially. It also allows system operators to evaluate the impact of SCADA data accuracy on real-time LMP.

"Petrella A., Sapio A.","Assessing the impact of forward trading, retail liberalization, and white certificates on the Italian wholesale electricity prices",2012,13.0,"How do policy actions affect the dynamics of deregulated electricity prices? We investigate this issue in the context of the Italian Power Exchange (IPEX), using data on the daily average day-ahead price (PUN) between April 2004 and December 2008. Estimates of baseline time series models (SARMAX and SARMAX-EGARCH) and their forecasting performances suggest that the trend in natural gas prices, market power indicators, deterministic weekly patterns, perceived temperatures, persistence in conditional volatility, and the inverse leverage effect are essential features of the PUN dynamics. We then augment the best-performing models with dummies that account for changes in the market architecture, such as the introduction of contracts for differences (CfDs) to support renewables, trading of white certificates for energy efficiency, and the demand-side liberalization. The findings show that changes in the market architecture affected both the PUN level and its volatility. Specifically, wholesale electricity prices and volatility appear to have decreased upon the introduction of CfDs, only to be pushed upwards following the start of white certificates' trading and retail liberalization. Moreover, after controlling for reforms the inverse leverage effect vanishes, and the persistence in volatility is lower than in the baseline estimates. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity prices; Policy; Time series,Commerce; Energy efficiency; Natural gas; Public policy; Time series; Electricity prices; Essential features; Forecasting performance; Market architectures; Perceived temperature; Time series models; White certificates; Wholesale electricity; Costs; commodity price; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy market; forecasting method; liberalization; natural gas; retailing; time series analysis; Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Uniejewski B., Marcjasz G., Weron R.",On the importance of the long-term seasonal component in day-ahead electricity price forecasting: Part II — Probabilistic forecasting,2019,12.0,"A recent electricity price forecasting study has shown that the Seasonal Component AutoRegressive (SCAR) modeling framework, which consists of decomposing a series of spot prices into a trend-seasonal and a stochastic component, modeling them independently and then combining their forecasts, can yield more accurate point predictions than an approach in which the same autoregressive model is calibrated to the prices themselves. Here, we show that further accuracy gains can be achieved when the explanatory variables (load forecasts) are deseasonalized as well. More importantly, considering a novel extension of the SCAR concept to probabilistic forecasting and applying two methods of combining predictive distributions, we find that (i) SCAR-type models nearly always significantly outperform the autoregressive benchmark but are in turn outperformed by combined SCAR forecasts, (ii) predictive distributions computed using Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) outperform those obtained from historical simulation and bootstrap methods, and (iii) averaging over predictive distributions generally yields better probabilistic forecasts of electricity spot prices than averaging over quantiles. Given that probabilistic forecasting is a concept closely related to risk management, our study has important implications for risk officers and portfolio managers in the power sector. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity spot price; Long-term seasonal component; Pinball score; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA); Risk management; Seasonal Component AutoRegressive (SCAR) model,Costs; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Risk management; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Auto-regressive; Electricity spot price; Long-term seasonal component; Pinball score; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile regression; Power markets; electricity supply; forecasting method; numerical model; probability; regression analysis; seasonality; time series analysis,Burde denne kanskje tilbake?

"Unger E.A., Ulfarsson G.F., Gardarsson S.M., Matthiasson T.",The effect of wind energy production on cross-border electricity pricing: The case of western Denmark in the Nord Pool market,2018,12.0,"The aim of this analysis was to estimate the effect of planned cross-border energy flow and different levels of predicted wind energy share with respect to the three pricing outcomes (higher price, lower price, or equal prices) that can occur between a pair of trading partners in the Nordic day-ahead spot market. The analysis covers a four-year period (2012–2015). Three multinomial logit models were designed, one for trade with each of western Denmark's (DK1) Nord Pool day-ahead spot market trading partners: eastern Denmark (DK2); southern Norway (NO2); and Stockholm, Sweden (SE3). It was found that both wind energy production and planned energy cross-border flow have a large effect on the probabilities of the pricing outcomes, with greater wind energy production in DK1 linked to lower prices in DK1 and lower wind energy linked to higher prices in DK1, although the effects varied considerably across trading partners. For example, if western Denmark's wind share of production was less than 33%, on average there was a 253% increase in the probability of DK1 having a higher price than NO2, and, in the SE3 model, this corresponding value was 359.8%, which encourages trading behavior to reduce the price differences. However, the existence of such large price differences suggests that interconnector transmission capacity or trading volume is not enough to balance the price in these circumstances. Overall, the results support the conclusion that increased interconnection can reduce price differences. © 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland",Europe; Market coupling; Nord Pool; Renewable energy; Wind energy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kühnlenz F., Nardelli P.H.J., Karhinen S., Svento R.",Implementing flexible demand: Real-time price vs. market integration,2018,12.0,"This paper proposes an agent-based model that combines both spot and balancing electricity markets. From this model, we develop a multi-agent simulation to study the integration of the consumers’ flexibility into the system. Our study identifies the conditions that real-time prices may lead to higher electricity costs, which in turn contradicts the usual claim that such a pricing scheme reduces cost. We show that such undesirable behavior is in fact systemic. Due to the existing structure of the wholesale market, the predicted demand that is used in the formation of the price is never realized since the flexible users will change their demand according to such established price. As the demand is never correctly predicted, the volume traded through the balancing markets increases, leading to higher overall costs. In this case, the system can sustain, and even benefit from, a small number of flexible users, but this solution can never upscale without increasing the total costs.

"Golmohamadi H., Keypour R.",A bi-level robust optimization model to determine retail electricity price in presence of a significant number of invisible solar sites,2018,12.0,"This paper presents a bi-level model for day-ahead electricity pricing and dispatch problems faced by a distributed generation (DG)-owning retailer who plays an intermediary role between the wholesale electricity market and end-use consumers. In this approach, the stochastic programming is addressed in the upper level to study behavior of the retailer in the wholesale electricity market in presence of self-generation facilities, including thermal DGs, wind farms and roof-top photovoltaic (RPV) sites. Regarding increased penetration of RPV sites, a data dimension reduction technique through k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) methods is used to hedge against large-scale output power data of RPV sites. In addition, to forecast day-ahead power output of RPV sites, a similar-day detection (SDD) technique is addressed to investigate the impacts of climate variables, e.g. irradiation, sunshine hours and temperature, on 24-hour-ahead power of RPV sites. In the lower level problem, information gap decision theory (IGDT) is proposed to determine robustness of retail electricity price against uncertain clients’ consumption. In this way, robustness and opportuneness functions are discussed to evaluate immunity against failure and windfall reward, respectively. Finally, numerical results based on actual data from PJM market and North Carolina solar sites are presented to demonstrate the usefulness and proficiency of the proposed framework. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price; Retailer; Robust; Roof-top solar sites; Stochastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zhai Y., Biel K., Zhao F., Sutherland J.W.",Dynamic scheduling of a flow shop with on-site wind generation for energy cost reduction under real time electricity pricing,2017,12.0,On-site renewable electricity generation represents an attractive option for manufacturing enterprises to deal with time varying electricity prices while reducing their carbon footprint. Production scheduling can be used to take full advantage of the installed renewable energy capacity for electricity cost reduction. A dynamic scheduling approach is proposed to minimize the electricity cost of a flow shop with a grid-integrated wind turbine. Time series models are used to provide updated wind speed and electricity prices as actual data becomes available. The production schedule and energy supply decisions are adjusted based on the new information. The approach is demonstrated using a case study. © 2017,Electricity price forecast; On-site renewable energy generation; Real time pricing; Scheduling; Wind energy,Carbon; Carbon footprint; Costs; Machine shop practice; Power markets; Production control; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Electricity prices; Energy cost reduction; Manufacturing enterprise; Production Scheduling; Real time pricing; Renewable energy capacity; Renewable energy generation; Time-varying electricity prices; Cost reduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, a single input and multi-output (SIMO) model for typical CHPs is established, considering the varying ratio between heat and electricity outputs at different loading levels. Then, the energy prices are forecasted with a gray forecasting model and revised in real-time based on the actual prices by using the least squares method. At last, a discrete optimization model and corresponding dynamic programming algorithm are developed to design the optimal operation strategies for CHPs in real-time. Based on the forecasted prices, the potential operating strategy which may produce the maximum profits is pre-developed. Dynamic modification is then conducted to adjust the pre-developed operating strategy after the actual prices are known. The proposed method is implemented on a 1 MW CHP on a typical day. Results show the optimized profits comply well with those derived from real-time prices after considering dynamic modification process. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Combined heat and power (CHP); Discrete optimization; Dynamic programming; Price forecasting; Real-time market,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Power markets; Profitability; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power system; Deregulated energy market; Discrete optimization; Dynamic programming algorithm; Optimal operation strategy; Price forecasting; Real-time market; Dynamic programming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Joëts M.,"Heterogeneous beliefs, regret, and uncertainty: The role of speculation in energy price dynamics",2015,12.0,"This paper proposes to investigate the impact of financialization on energy markets (oil, gas, coal, and electricity European forward prices) during both normal times and periods of extreme fluctuation by using an original behavioral and emotional approach. With this aim, we propose a new theoretical and empirical framework based on a heterogeneous agents model in which fundamentalists and chartists co-exist and are subject to regret and uncertainty. We find significant evidence that energy markets are composed of heterogeneous traders who behave differently depending on the intensity of the price fluctuations and the uncertainty context. In particular, energy prices are governed primarily by fundamental and chartist agents that are neutral to uncertainty during normal times, whereas these prices face irrational chartist investors averse to uncertainty during periods of extreme fluctuations. In this context, the recent surge in energy prices can be viewed as the consequence of irrational exuberance. Our new theoretical model is suitable for modeling energy price dynamics and outperforms both the random walk and the ARMA model in out-of-sample predictive ability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) withinthe International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

"Cox M., Peichl A., Pestel N., Siegloch S.",Labor demand effects of rising electricity prices: Evidence for Germany,2014,12.0,"Germany continues to play a pioneering role in replacing conventional power plants with renewable energy sources. While this might be beneficial with respect to environmental quality, it also implies increasing electricity prices. The extent to which this is associated with negative impacts on employment depends on the interrelationship between labor and electricity as input factors in the production process. In this paper, we estimate cross-price elasticities between electricity and heterogeneous labor for the German manufacturing sector. We use administrative linked employer-employee micro-data combined with information on sector-level electricity prices and usage over the period 2003-2007. We find positive, but small conditional cross-price elasticities of labor demand with respect to electricity prices, which means that electricity as an input factor can be replaced by labor to a limited extent when the production level is held constant. In the case of adjustable output, we find negative unconditional cross-price elasticities, implying that higher electricity prices lead to output reductions and to lower labor demand, with low- and high-skilled workers being affected more than medium-skilled. Resulting adverse distributional effects and potential overall job losses may pose challenges for policy-makers in securing public support for the German energy turnaround. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity prices; Employment; Energy; Germany; Labor demand,Elasticity; Employment; Renewable energy resources; Conventional power plants; Cross-price elasticity; Electricity prices; Energy; Germany; Labor demands; Linked employer employees; Renewable energy source; Costs; alternative energy; demand analysis; electricity supply; employment; energy market; labor market; labor supply; price dynamics; renewable resource; Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Saâdaoui F.,The Price and Trading Volume Dynamics Relationship in the EEX Power Market: A Wavelet Modeling,2013,12.0,"This paper examines the dynamic relationship between power spot prices and related trading volumes in one of the most emergent energy markets. Traditionally, investigating the bivariate stochastic processes has been dominated by linear econometrical methods that proved helpful especially in finance. However, when dealing with intradaily power data, we cannot rely on models developed for financial or other commodity markets. Therefore, wavelet transforms are applied for power markets data to search for and decode nonlinear regularities and hidden patterns existing between the variables. Given its ability to decompose the time series into their time scale components and thus to reveal structure at different time horizons, wavelets are useful in analyzing situations in which the degree of association between processes is likely to change with the time-horizon. Therefore, a wavelet-based cross-analysis is performed between prices and trading volume time series. On the same basis, causality tests and out-of-sample forecasting tasks are carried out to empirically the strong relationship between the two investigated time series. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Electricity spot prices; European energy markets; Forecasting; Maximum overlapped discrete wavelet transform; Multiscale causality; Trading volume; Wavelet cross-correlation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A wireless communication infrastructure is assumed for the smart meter network. The dynamics of the power market are assumed to be a Markov decision process (MDP) by modeling the power load evolution as a two-state Markov chain. The fundamental elements of the MDP are discussed and the optimal strategy is obtained from dynamic programming. Due to the curse of dimensions, the myopic strategy is proposed to significantly simplify the algorithm. The validity of the proposed scheduling algorithm is demonstrated using numerical simulations. For example, for price insensitive power users, the average price and power generation errors are reduced by 60% and 40% using the myopic approach, compared with the simple round robin schedule, in certain circumstances. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Power market; scheduling; smart grid; wireless communications,Markov Decision Processes; Myopic strategies; Optimal strategies; Power load; Power markets; Power users; Round-robin schedule; Smart grid; Smart meters; Two-state Markov chains; Wireless communications; Commerce; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Markov processes; Scheduling; Wireless telecommunication systems; Smart power grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Templet P.H.,Energy price disparity and public welfare,2001,12.0,"The differences in the price of energy to economic sectors are linked to a number of system parameters and to public welfare. There are large disparities in energy prices within states when comparing residential and industrial prices although neoclassical economics predicts one price in markets. The large disparities between the two sectors across states negatively affects the efficiency of resource allocation, creates subsidies for those getting the cheap energy and results in unequal access to energy. These in turn lead to inefficient partitioning of energy between products and waste, higher pollution, leakage of wealth and poorer energy use efficiency, i.e. high energy intensity. States with large energy price disparities between sectors have statistically higher poverty, lower incomes, more pollution and use more energy but with less efficiency. Higher energy price disparities also result in higher throughput per unit of output thus reducing the chances for sustainability and lower public welfare. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Diversity; Energy; Energy intensity; Price disparity; Sustainability; Welfare,energy market; income; price dynamics; welfare economics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper assesses the distributional effects of these price increases in Cyprus by specifying and estimating a consumer demand system with price heterogeneity between households. This novel method allows obtaining robust parameter estimates even when household expenditure surveys are limited, as is the case in many European countries. The empirical analysis is conducted both conditional on energy-related household characteristics and unconditionally. We then use the estimated demand system to conduct welfare analysis. We find that the rise in energy prices results in welfare losses of EUR 101 per household (in 2009 prices) in year 2020, or a nationwide welfare loss of more than EUR'2009 33 million. Price increases will be regressive and will affect small and urban households more strongly than the rest of the population. Furthermore, we find that the largest proportion of welfare loss is due to loss of household's income purchasing power caused by higher energy prices, while the changes in relative prices induce deadweight loss which is a small part of welfare loss because of the limited substitutability of energy with other goods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Climate policy; Deadweight loss; Demand system; Distributional effect,Climate policy; Demand system; Distributional effect; Empirical analysis; Energy and climate policies; European Countries; Household expenditure surveys; Preference heterogeneity; Cost accounting; Costs; demand analysis; energy market; energy policy; environmental policy; European Union; heterogeneity; household income; price dynamics; purchasing power parity; welfare economics; Cyprus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Grimes D., Ifrim G., O'Sullivan B., Simonis H.",Analyzing the impact of electricity price forecasting on energy cost-aware scheduling,2014,11.0,"Energy cost-aware scheduling, i.e., scheduling that adapts to real-time energy price volatility, can save large energy consumers millions of dollars every year in electricity costs. Energy price forecasting coupled with energy price-aware scheduling, is a step toward this goal. In this work, we study cost-aware schedules and the effect of various price forecasting schemes on the end schedule-cost. We show that simply optimizing price forecasts based on classical regression error metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error), does not work well for scheduling. Price forecasts that do result in significantly better schedules, optimize a combination of metrics, each having a different impact on the end-schedule-cost. For example, both price estimation and price ranking are important for scheduling, but they carry different weight. We consider day-ahead energy price forecasting using the Irish Single Electricity Market as a case-study, and test our price forecasts for two real-world scheduling applications: animal feed manufacturing and home energy management systems. We show that price forecasts that co-optimize price estimation and price ranking, result in significant energy-cost savings. We believe our results are relevant for many real-life scheduling applications that are currently plagued with very large energy bills. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The paper is focused on balancing markets pricing policies. The proposal of a new imbalance price scheme is included and conveniently evaluated. This proposed scheme tries to minimise the use of ancillary services to compensate for deviations in searching for a more efficient market design. The effectiveness of imbalance prices as market signals is also examined, and policy recommendations regarding imbalance services are discussed. Two test cases are included that analyse the participation of a wind power producer in the Spanish electricity market using a stochastic optimisation strategy. For this purpose, the uncertainty of the variables is considered, i.e., wind power production and prediction, intraday and imbalance prices. Test cases were run with real data for 10 months, and realistic results are presented along with a hypothetical test case. The regulation of the imbalance prices may not be adequate for the Spanish electricity market because an error drop is not sufficiently encouraged. Therefore, we suggest the application of a new imbalance price scheme, which includes an additional constraint.

"Black J.W., Tyagi R.",Potential problems with large scale differential pricing programs,2010,11.0,"Flat rate prices for residential customers have historically enhanced the ability of system operators to predict demand by providing a smooth, certain price signal, thus reducing risk in meeting the need to instantaneously balance supply and demand in electricity systems/markets. The desire to reduce peak loads, however, has lead to exploration of dynamic pricing, including time of use and critical peak pricing programs. These programs are currently in the pilot stage throughout the US, with low overall participation by residential load. Large-scale participation in dynamic pricing programs can cause unwanted consequences that will not be observed in small-scale programs. This paper investigates several potential negative consequences from large-scale participation in existing dynamic pricing programs.

We computed thousands of tests regarding the machine learning parameters combinations as there is no method to set the optimal structure for these models. The results show that machine learning methods outperform traditional econometric methods and also that they present an additional advantage, which is the capacity to predict turning points.

"Simshauser P., Whish-Wilson P.",Price discrimination in Australia's retail electricity markets: An analysis of Victoria & Southeast Queensland,2017,10.0,"When capital-intensive monopoly industries are restructured and deregulated, consumer prices commence a natural drift from regulated uniform ‘average cost’ tariffs to competitive differential prices, and this can raise problems for policymakers. Deep discounts are welcomed, high Standing Offers are not. But price discrimination is unremarkable in economics. Indeed, in industries where fixed & sunk costs represent a significant portion of total cost, discriminatory pricing is usually welfare enhancing. Conversely, theory predicts and empirical evidence confirms that regulatory efforts to cherry-pick differential prices in asymmetric markets will damage consumer welfare. In this article, we analyse differential retail electricity offer prices in the Australian States of Victoria and Queensland and contrast these with industry average total cost and the marginal cost of retail supply. We find deregulated Victoria displays high price dispersion with Standing Offer tariffs 10% above industry average total cost and marginal offers at break-even prices (i.e. 20% below average total cost). In the semi-regulated Southeast Queensland market where a regulated price-cap exists, there is lower dispersion but marginal offers include a 6.7% retail mark-up. Efficient pricing requires the marginal unit produced to be priced at marginal cost and Victoria meets this criteria – but we identify an episode of inter-consumer misallocation due to high Standing Offers. We conclude policy initiatives designed to help firms shift vulnerable households from Standing Offer tariffs is desirable. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity tariffs; Non-linear prices; Price discrimination,Commerce; Dispersions; Economics; Power markets; Sales; Break-even prices; Consumer welfares; Discriminatory pricing; Electricity tariff; Non linear; Policy initiatives; Price discrimination; Retail electricity markets; Costs; capital; electricity supply; energy market; monopoly; price dynamics; retailing; tariff structure; Australia; Queensland; Victoria [Australia],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Figueiredo N.C., Silva P.P.D., Bunn D.",Weather and market specificities in the regional transmission of renewable energy price effects,2016,10.0,"This study is motivated by the observation that the effects of renewable energy output variations across several integrated power markets are likely to be complicated by price arbitrage and weather dynamics. Wind in particular has supply side effects when associated with substantial generating facilities, but also demand side influences when associated with extreme weather conditions. To unravel these effects, daily electricity prices and the weather variables wind, temperature and their interaction (wind chill) in the Central-West Europe coupled market were analysed from 2007 to the end of 2014 by means of vector autoregressions. The spillover effects were found to be quite subtle. Despite efficient price arbitrage, it is not the case that daily wind output shocks diffuse uniformly across all markets, or that the largest generator of wind energy creates the most significant spillovers or that high wind conditions necessarily lead to lower prices. Market specificities matter and are important for operational prediction and weather risk hedging. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity; Market integration; Prices; Weather; Wind energy,Costs; Electricity; Financial markets; Regression analysis; Weathering; Wind power; Electricity prices; Extreme weather conditions; Market integration; Operational predictions; Prices; Renewable energies; Spillover effects; Vector autoregressions; Commerce; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity supply; price dynamics; renewable resource; spillover effect; temperature; vector autoregression; weather; wind power; Europe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Melichar M.,Energy price shocks and economic activity: Which energy price series should we be using?,2016,10.0,"There is not one primary energy market and the price of oil is not a good proxy for many alternative energy prices. Therefore, this paper explores the effects of alternative energy price shocks on economic activity, and examines the relative performance of these alternative measures in predicting state level economic activity using the Davidson and MacKinnon J-test. The alternative energy price series considered are as follows: gasoline, diesel, natural gas, heating oil, and electricity. Alternative measures of energy price shocks produce different patterns of impulse responses than oil price shocks. Additionally, overwhelming evidence indicates that alternative energy price models, excluding models containing the price of gasoline, outperform the baseline model containing the price of oil for many states, particularly at short-to-mid forecast horizons.

An hourly-discretized optimization algorithm is proposed to identify the optimum daily operational strategy to be followed by the photovoltaic system, provided that a forecast for solar-power and load is available. This model is suitable to be applied in the real time operation of a typical house. The proposed strategy maximizes the individual revenue without shifting power demand.

"Nieuwenhout F., Brand A.",The impact of wind power on day-ahead electricity prices in the Netherlands,2011,10.0,"A detailed analysis was conducted to assess to what extent availability of wind energy has influenced day-ahead electricity prices in the Netherlands over the past four years. With a meteorological model, time series of day-ahead wind forecasts were generated for the period 2006-2009, and these were compared with APX-ENDEX day-ahead market prices. Wind energy contributes to only 4% of electricity generation in the Netherlands, but was found to depress average day-ahead market prices by about 5%. With the help of the bid curves on the APX-ENDEX day-ahead market for 2009, a model was made to assess the impact of increasing levels of wind generation on power prices in the Netherlands. One of the main findings is that the future impact on prices will be less than in the past. With an increase of installed wind capacity from 2200 MW to 6000 MW, average day-ahead prices are expected to be depressed by an additional 6% in case no additional conventional generation is assumed. Taking into account existing government policy on wind and ongoing work on new conventional power plants, prices in 2016 will be only 3% lower due to wind. © 2011 IEEE.",,Bid curve; Conventional generation; Conventional power plants; Day ahead market; Day-ahead prices; Electricity generation; Electricity prices; Meteorological models; Netherlands; Power price; Wind capacity; Wind forecasts; Wind generation; Commerce; Electric generators; Electricity; Time series; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Galetovic A., Muñoz C.M.",Estimating deficit probabilities with price-responsive demand in contract-based electricity markets,2009,10.0,"Studies that estimate deficit probabilities in hydrothermal systems have generally ignored the response of demand to changing prices, in the belief that such response is largely irrelevant.

To make our point we present an estimation of deficit probabilities in Chile's Central Interconnected System between 2006 and 2010.

"Skantze P., Ilic M., Gubina A.",Modelling locational price spreads in competitive electricity markets; applications for transmission rights valuation and replication,2004,10.0,"The restructuring of the electric utilities industry has forced industry participants to rethink their approach to a number of decision processes. To manage risk and plan investment in generation assets, as well as to examine the efficient expansion of the current transmission grid, one needs to have a clear understanding of the interaction between the grid properties and the behaviour of the regional power markets. In this paper we discuss a fundamental modelling approach which extracts the stochastic properties of electricity prices by modelling the impact of physical and economic drivers affecting the production, delivery, and consumption of electricity. If the fundamental inputs are directly observable, we can use historical data to calibrate the model parameters. In the case of electricity, this simple and abundant set of training data can make a crucial difference. We present the bid-based stochastic model (BSM) and look into its application to valuing of financial derivatives, especially options based on the locational spread in electricity price between two markets. The advantage of the bid-based model is that one is able to link the capacity of the transmission line, in megawatts, directly to the correlation between electricity prices at the end nodes. This leads us to a valuation method for a locational spread option, the financial equivalent of a physical transmission right. The model represents an improvement over standard spread option formulation in that it accounts for the effect of the nonlinear flows in the transmission network on the correlation and distribution of locational prices. We also address the question of whether financial transmission rights can be replicated with a dynamic portfolio of forward contracts at the end nodes. This poses the possibility of model-based arbitrage between existing forward markets and the emerging transmission rights markets. Furthermore, it allows users to simulate the effect of transmission outages or expansion. For example, a for-profit transmission provider who is contemplating addition of a new transmission line between two markets needs to know whether he will be able to recover the fixed cost of investing in the line by selling transmission rights to market participants. By calibrating the bid-based model according to current price levels and adding the capacity of the new transmission line, the transmission owner can simulate future cash flows and estimate the profitability of the investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Taghizadeh-Hesary F., Yoshino N., Inagaki Y.",Empirical analysis of factors influencing the price of solar modules,2019,9.0,"Purpose: One of the key drivers behind the recent growth in the global solar energy market is the decline in solar module prices. Many empirical analyses have been carried out to identify the mechanism behind this price reduction. However, studies on the price reduction mechanism of solar modules over the years have focused purely on the technological aspect of manufacturing. The purpose of this study is to consider the influence of economic and monetary factors such as the interest rate and exchange rate on solar module pricing in addition to other factors that considered in earlier studies including technology, wage rate and other energy prices. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, an oligopolistic model and econometric method are used to determine the economic factors that have an influence on solar module prices. The paper constructs a solar module pricing model and conducts a fully modified ordinary least squares analysis to estimate the influence of each factor. Analysis is conducted for the top five solar module producing countries in the world from 1997 to 2015. The five countries are the People’s Republic of China, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the USA. Findings: Empirical analysis provides several findings concerning the solar module pricing mechanism. These vary for each country. However, generally the interest rate has a positive correlation with solar module prices, while the exchange rate, knowledge stock and oil price have a negative correlation with solar module prices. Practical implications: First, the government must expand channels for renewable energy funding. As renewable industries are high-tech, the influence that capital cost has on technology price is significant. Government efforts to provide industries with low-interest finance will accelerate renewable business. There have been many attempts to lower interest rates for renewable energy technology to accelerate growth in the green technology market. Second, the government must expand research and development (R&D) expenditures focused on renewable energy technology. The technological advancements acquired through R&D enhance module performance efficiency, thereby reducing costs. Therefore, government policies aimed at increasing targeted R&D expenditure will be an effective means of expanding the installation of renewable energies.

"Sapio A., Spagnolo N.",Price regimes in an energy island: Tacit collusion vs. cost and network explanations,2016,9.0,"In this paper, we explore the determinants of wholesale electricity prices in an energy island such as Sicily, by estimating regime switching models with fixed and time-varying transition probabilities on daily data in the 2012-2014 period. Explanatory variables used alternatively in the price equation and in the switching equation include power demand, the supply of intermittent renewables, the residual supply index, and a congestion indicator. Four competing hypotheses on the determinants of price regimes are tested (arbitrary market power, cost profile, tacit collusion, congestion) in order to understand why, despite the general trend of declining prices induced by renewables in southern Italy, Sicilian prices stood high. The pattern of estimated coefficients is consistent with a tacit collusion story. © 2016.",Electricity price; Energy island; Markov regime-switching; Price regimes; Tacit collusion,Economics; Energy resources; Electricity prices; Energy island; Markov regime-switching; Price regimes; Tacit collusion; Costs; demand analysis; electricity supply; energy market; price determination; probability; Italy; Sicily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lai P., Du M., Wang B., Chen Z.",Assessment and decomposition of total factor energy efficiency: An evidence based on energy shadow price in China,2016,9.0,"By adopting an energy-input based directional distance function, we calculated the shadow price of four types of energy (i.e., coal, oil, gas and electricity) among 30 areas in China from 1998 to 2012. Moreover, a macro-energy efficiency index in China was estimated and divided into intra-provincial technical efficiency, allocation efficiency of energy input structure and inter-provincial energy allocation efficiency. It shows that total energy efficiency has decreased in recent years, where intra-provincial energy technical efficiency drops markedly and extensive mode of energy consumption rises. However, energy structure and allocation improves slowly. Meanwhile, lacking an integrated energy market leads to the loss of energy efficiency. Further improvement of market allocation and structure adjustment play a pivotal role in the increase of energy efficiency. © 2016 by the authors.",Directional distance function; Efficiency decomposition; Energy efficiency; Shadow price,assessment method; decomposition analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy use; shadow pricing; spatiotemporal analysis; China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Uritskaya O.Y., Uritsky V.M.",Predictability of price movements in deregulated electricity markets,2015,9.0,"In this paper we investigate predictability of electricity prices in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Ontario, as well as in the US Mid-C market. Using scale-dependent detrended fluctuation analysis, spectral analysis, and the probability distribution analysis we show that the studied markets exhibit strongly anti-persistent properties suggesting that their dynamics can be predicted based on historic price records across the range of time scales from 1. h to one month. For both Canadian markets, the price movements reveal three types of correlated behavior which can be used for forecasting. The discovered scenarios remain the same on different time scales up to one month as well as for on- and off-peak electricity data. These scenarios represent sharp increases of prices and are not present in the Mid-C market due to its lower volatility. We argue that extreme price movements in this market should follow the same tendency as the more volatile Canadian markets. The estimated values of the Pareto indices suggest that the prediction of these events can be statistically stable. The results obtained provide new relevant information for managing financial risks associated with the dynamics of electricity derivatives over time frame exceeding one day. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Deregulated electricity markets; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Efficient market hypothesis; Financial forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Financial markets; Forecasting; Power markets; Probability distributions; Spectrum analysis; Deregulated electricity market; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Different time scale; Efficient market hypothesis; Electricity derivatives; Electricity prices; Financial forecasting; Persistent properties; Deregulation; deregulation; electricity supply; financial system; prediction; price dynamics; probability; spectral analysis; Alberta; Canada; Ontario [Canada],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Governments have to enforce regulations to guarantee that such a power system, in spite of many competing stakeholders, participants, companies, and regulating agencies can be operational. This paper analyzes the present arrangements and the future requirements to be posed on incentives and regulation for ancillary services (AS) for power balancing. The paper proposes companies to assess their own needs for AS. A two-sided market for AS is being described to replace the existing arrangements for secondary control.

"Li Y., Flynn P.C.",Power Price in Deregulated Markets,2003,9.0,"We compare the diurnal pattern of power price for weekdays and weekends for 14 deregulated markets, and find significant differences. All markets show low early morning prices with one or more price peaks during the day and evening. North American markets show a weekday monotonic pattern; European and New Zealand markets show a ""double peak"" pattern. Markets differ in the ratio of daily maximum to minimum price and of average weekday to average weekend price, and hence have a different incentive for time shifting power consuming activities within and between days. Data were filtered to remove days of high or low price excursions. In some but not all markets both the average price and the diurnal price pattern change significantly; infrequent price excursions shape price patterns. Price shows a significant correlation to load in some but not all markets.

The model combines features of both reliability pricing and real-time pricing. A production cost simulation submodel is used to estimate expected total and marginal production costs on an hourly basis, as well as system reliability measured by the loss-of-load probability. These estimates are inputs to a welfare-maximization model with revenue constraints differentiated by customer class. The methodology is illustrated by a numerical application with typical power system and market data. The results show that the proposed pricing approach is significantly superior to spot and Ramsey pricing in terms of economic efficiency, energy conservation, and generation-capacity requirements.

"Goodarzi S., Perera H.N., Bunn D.",The impact of renewable energy forecast errors on imbalance volumes and electricity spot prices,2019,8.0,"This paper contributes to the general consideration of whether a policy of incentivising system operators to improve the quality and market availability of forecasts for renewable energy outputs would be beneficial. Using data from the German electricity market, we investigate the effect of wind and solar energy forecasts errors on imbalance volumes and subsequent spot electricity prices. We use ordinary least squares regression, quantile regression and autoregressive moving averages to identify these relationships using variables that have a quarter-hourly data granularity. The results show that higher wind and solar forecast errors increase the absolute values of imbalance volumes and that these can pass through into higher spot prices. We find that wind forecast errors in Germany impact spot prices more than solar forecasting errors. Policy incentives to improve the accuracy and availability of renewable energy forecasts by the system operators should therefore be encouraged. © 2019",Electricity imbalance; Electricity spot prices; Forecast errors; Renewable energy,Commerce; Costs; Errors; Solar energy; Weather forecasting; Autoregressive moving average; Electricity spot price; Forecast errors; Ordinary least squares regressions; Policy incentives; Quantile regression; Renewable energies; Spot electricity prices; Power markets; accuracy assessment; alternative energy; available water capacity; electricity industry; energy policy; error analysis; forecasting method; price dynamics; regression analysis; resource availability; Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings are that between 1981 and 2012, the level of the sectors’ energy intensity was subject to the combined impact of factor prices and biased technology progress. For some sectors, the average Allen-Uzawa elasticity of substitution (AES)for energy to capital or labor rental price was negative. For the 18 sectors, the biased technological progress was from energy savings, while one for the rest from energy consumption. In the 21 sectors, input price changes decreased the sectors’ energy intensity, while 17 of them had the sectors’ energy intensity decreased by technological progress. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Energy intensity; Factor price changes; Kalman filter estimation; Technological progress,econometrics; economic impact; energy efficiency; energy market; input-output analysis; Kalman filter; technological development; China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hu F., Feng X., Cao H.",A short-term decision model for electricity retailers: Electricity procurement and time-of-use pricing,2018,8.0,"This paper establishes a short-term decision model, based on robust optimization, for an electricity retailer to determine the electricity procurement and electricity retail prices. The electricity procurement process includes purchasing electricity from generation companies and from the spot market. The selling prices of electricity for the customers are based on time-of-use (TOU) pricing which is widely employed in modern electricity market as a demand response program. The objective of the model is to maximize the expected profit of the retailer through optimizing the electricity procurement strategy and electricity pricing scheme. A price elasticity matrix (PEM) is adopted to model the demand response. Also, uncertainty in spot prices is modeled using a robust optimization approach, in which price bounds are considered instead of predicted values. Using a robust optimization approach, the retailer can adjust the level of robustness of its decisions through a robust control parameter. A case study is presented to illustrate the performance of the model. The simulation results demonstrate that the developed model is effective in increasing the expected profit of the retailer and flattening the load profiles of customers. © 2018 by the authors.",Demand response; Electricity procurement; Robust optimization; Spot market; Time-of-use (TOU) pricing,Commerce; Costs; Optimization; Power markets; Profitability; Robust control; Sales; Demand response; Electricity procurement; Robust optimization; Spot market; Time-of-use pricing; Electric variables measurement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shenoy S., Gorinevsky D.",Data-Driven Stochastic Pricing and Application to Electricity Market,2016,8.0,"This paper develops a novel approach to computation of the probability integrals encountered in derivative pricing using stochastic models estimated from historical data. First, nonparametric probability distribution models are built directly from the data as a solution of a convex optimization problem scalable to very big datasets. Second, these models are used for numerical calculus of probability integrals, where the quadrature includes long tails of the probability distributions. The application example is the procurement contract in the day-ahead bulk market for electricity. The data for PJM utility loads and prices in the day-ahead and spot markets were used to estimate the risk and to price the contract. The data-driven forward contract pricing allows to optimize the contract cost and reduce it by 2% compared to the baseline; this corresponds to about 0.6B/year in potential utility savings. © 2016 IEEE.",Economic forecasting; financial management; power engineering; power generation dispatch; power system analysis computing; power system economics; probability density function; risk analysis,Big data; Calculations; Commerce; Convex optimization; Costs; Electric load dispatching; Power markets; Probability density function; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Economic forecasting; Financial managements; Power engineering; Power generation dispatch; Power system analysis computing; Power system economics; Probability distributions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Hille E., Möbius P.",Do energy prices affect employment? Decomposed international evidence,2019,7.0,"This paper analyzes the energy price-employment nexus and contributes to the literature by showing that it is important to decompose the regulatory effect into demand, cost, and factor-shift effects. This is done by means of a cross-country multi-sectoral dataset. The results show that both rising energy prices and shadow prices of energy have no significant effect on net employment when the manufacturing sectors only are analyzed. While finding significant variations across countries, the average employment effects become significantly positive once jobs in the economy as a whole are considered. This change is driven mainly by larger positive cost effects, which more than offset the negative demand effects and reductions in the positive factor-shift effects. Moreover, the paper reveals that the often implemented approach of using a simple regulation regressor, instead of decomposing the employment effect, can result in biased estimates. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Climate policy; Employment; Energy prices; Shadow prices,Employment; Biased estimates; Climate policy; Employment effects; Energy prices; Manufacturing sector; Negative demands; Regulatory effects; Shadow price; Costs; decomposition analysis; employment; energy market; environmental policy; implementation process; international comparison; regulatory approach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Zhou Q., Tesfatsion L., Liu C.-C.",Scenario generation for price forecasting in restructured wholesale power markets,2009,7.0,"In current restructured wholesale power markets, the short length of time series for prices makes it difficult to use empirical price data to test existing price forecasting tools and to develop new price forecasting tools. This study therefore proposes a two-stage approach for generating simulated price scenarios based on the available price data. The first stage consists of an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model for determining scenarios of cleared demands and scheduled generator outages (D&O), and a moment-matching method for reducing the number of D&O scenarios to a practical scale. In the second stage, polynomials are fitted between D&O and wholesale power prices in order to obtain price scenarios for a specified time frame. Time series data from the Midwest ISO (MISO) are used as a test system to validate the proposed approach. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach is able to generate price scenarios for distinct seasons with empirically realistic characteristics. ©2009 IEEE.",ARMA model; Moment-matching method; Restructured wholesale power markets; Scenario generation; Wholesale power prices,ARMA model; Moment-matching method; Restructured wholesale power markets; Scenario generation; Wholesale power prices; Commerce; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Method of moments; Power transmission; Time series; Electric load forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gibescu M., Kling W.L., van Zwet E.W.",Bidding and regulating strategies in a dual imbalance pricing system: Case study for a Dutch wind producer,2008,7.0,"In this work, offshore wind power forecast and realisation data are combined with price information from the day-ahead market operated by the Amsterdam Power Exchange and from the imbalance market operated by the Dutch System Operator. This allows for computing spot-market revenues and imbalance penalties or gains for a wind power producer. Three different cases are evaluated: a perfect forecast, actual forecasting error distribution with median contracting and with 'optimal quantile' contracting. The optimal quantile is determined from the probability distribution of the random average wind power production and depends on price predictions for the spot and imbalance prices. The wind producer can use two down-regulating strategies to avoid being charged for excess energy during times when the surplus price becomes negative. The optimal quantile bidding combined with a strategy of down-regulating to contract level produces a comparable yearly revenue with that of an equivalent deterministic producer.

Punzi M.T.,The impact of energy price uncertainty on macroeconomic variables,2019,6.0,"This paper evaluates the macroeconomic implications of energy price volatility through the lens of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model in an open economy. The model develops a small open economy in which households consume energy products and firms use energy as productivity inputs, where the country is so small that it needs to import energy, the price of which is determined abroad. Whereas positive energy price shocks cause an economic slowdown due to higher costs for consumers and firms, energy price volatility shocks generate an increase in GDP in the short-run and a reversal in the long-run. These findings are empirically supported by estimates from a Panel VAR model applied to 10 Asian economies, where energy price volatility has a positive impact on GDP in the short-run. Moreover, the paper finds that increasing demand or supply uncertainty also affect energy prices, with amplified fluctuations relative to a model that abstracts from energy. Market volatility leads households to cut consumption for precautionary savings motives, which in turn increases investment. Both energy price and uncertainty fluctuation lead to high macroeconomic volatility in the business cycle. Policy makers should encourage investment in energy security and renewable energy, such that households and firms would become less responding to fluctuations in the non-renewable energy market. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",C32 E21; DSGE model; E22; Energy price; F41; Panel VAR; Q43; Stochastic volatility; Uncertainty,Commerce; Costs; Energy policy; Energy security; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Value engineering; C32 E21; DSGE models; Energy prices; Panel vars; Stochastic volatility; Uncertainty; Investments; alternative energy; business cycle; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; energy market; energy policy; Gross Domestic Product; household energy; investment; macroeconomics; policy making; price dynamics; stochasticity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ma K., Wang C., Yang J., Hua C., Guan X.",Pricing mechanism with noncooperative game and revenue sharing contract in electricity market,2019,6.0,"In this paper, a pricing mechanism is proposed for the electricity supply chain, which is consisting of one generation company (GC), multiple consumers, and competing utility companies (UCs). The UC participates in electricity supply chain management by a revenue sharing contract (RSC). In the electricity supply chain, the electricity real-time balance has an important role in the stable operation of the power system. Therefore, we introduce the demand response into the electricity supply chain to match supply with demand under forecast errors. Hence, we formulate a noncooperative game to characterize the interactions among the multiple competing UCs, which set the retail prices to maximize their profits. Besides, the UCs select their preferred contractual terms offered by the GC to maximize its profits and coordinate the electricity supply chain simultaneously. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) are examined, and an iterative algorithm is developed to obtain the NE. Furthermore, we analyze the RSC that can coordinate the electricity supply chain and align the NE with the cooperative optimum under the RSC. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model and the influence of market demand disruptions on the profits of the UCs, GC, and supply chain. © 2013 IEEE.",Electricity supply chain; load forecast errors; noncooperative game; pricing mechanism; revenue sharing contract (RSC),Binary alloys; Commerce; Contracts; Costs; Electric load management; Electric power generation; Electric power plant loads; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Game theory; Industry; Iterative methods; Power markets; Profitability; Supply chains; Uranium compounds; Electricity supply; Games; Load forecast; Load forecasting; Noncooperative game; Pricing mechanism; Revenue sharing contracts; Supply chain management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hashmi M.U., Muthirayan D., Bušić A.",Effect of real-Time electricity pricing on ancillary service requirements,2018,6.0,"The objective of this work is to analyze the effect of real time electricity price (RTP) on the amount of ancillary services required for load balancing in presence of responsive users, information asymmetry and forecast errors in demand and renewable energy sources (RES) generation. We consider a RTP that is determined by the forecasted generation and ramping cost. A community choice aggregator manages the load of all the consumers by setting the price. The consumer’s objective is to minimize their overall cost of consumption. Ancillary services are called upon to balance the load in real time. With zero RES in the power network and a high degree of load flexibility, the proposed RTP flattens and the volatility in demand vanishes. However, in presence of RES the volatility in price and demand is reduced up to an extent and ancillary services are required for load balancing. The amount of ancillary services required increases with forecast errors. We also propose a real time algorithm that approximates the optimal consumer behavior under the complete information setting.

"Severini M., Squartini S., Fagiani M., Piazza F.",Energy management with the support of dynamic pricing strategies in real micro-grid scenarios,2015,6.0,"Although smart grids are regarded as the technology to overcome the limits of nowadays power distribution grids, the transition will require much time. Dynamic pricing, a straightforward implementation of demand response, may provide the means to manipulate the grid load thus extending the life expectancy of current technology. However, to integrate a dynamic pricing scheme in the crowded pool of technologies, available at demand side, a proper energy manager with the support of a pricing profile forecaster is mandatory. Although energy management and price forecasting are recurrent topics, in literature they have been addressed separately. On the other hand, in this work, the aim is to investigate how well an energy manager is able to perform in presence of data uncertainty originating from the forecasting process. On purpose, an energy and resource manager has been revised and extended in the current manuscript. Finally, it has been complemented with a price forecasting technique, based on the Extreme Learning Machine paradigm. The proposed forecaster has proven to be better performing and more robust, with respect to the most common forecasting approaches. The energy manager, as well, has proven that the energy efficiency of the residential environment can be improved significantly. Nonetheless, to achieve the theoretical optimum, forecasting techniques tailored for that purpose may be required. © 2015 IEEE.",Dynamic Price Forecasting; Energy Management; Extreme Learning Machine; Mixed-Integer Linear Programming; Neural Networks; Smart Micro Grid,Costs; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Forecasting; Houses; Integer programming; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Managers; Neural networks; Power markets; Current technology; Dynamic price; Extreme learning machine; Forecasting techniques; Mixed integer linear programming; Power distribution grids; Residential environment; Smart Micro Grids; Smart power grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to accurately assess the cost of a given project, the feeder losses must be calculated. In the past, it was necessary to estimate the feeder losses based upon the peak load and a calculated load factor for the year. The cost of these losses would then be calculated based upon an expected, fixed per-kW h generation cost. This paper presents a more accurate means of calculating the cost of losses, using hourly feeder load information and time-varying electric energy cost data.

"Materassi D., Roozbehani M., Dahleh M.A.",Equilibrium price distributions in energy markets with shiftable demand,2012,6.0,"The paper examines existence of equilibrium price distributions in energy markets with real-time pricing and consumers with time-flexible demands. Previous works have examined consumer optimal policies for shifting time-flexible loads up to a deadline, in response to an exogenous and stochastic price process. It is shown here that under some mild assumptions on the stochastic price process and the information structure in the market, the individual consumer's optimal policy is a threshold policy. The threshold policy indicates that a consumer will consume only when the price falls below a certain threshold which depends on the time left to his deadline and the information on the price process. This behavior by individual consumer leads to an aggregate behavior by a large number of consumers who implement threshold policies in reaction to the price process; although at each instant of time, different consumers may have different thresholds due to different deadlines and different information assumptions. The aggregate response from the consumers determines the state of the wholesale market, and thus, affects the price process. The question that we intend to answer in this paper is that of consistency of assumptions on the price process and the market outcomes. It is assumed that the price at each time interval is determined by the Independent Service Operator (ISO) on the basis of an estimate of the global consumption as a function of price. It is shown that under technical regularity assumptions on the model components, the price distribution has at least one equilibrium point. Thus, there exists at least one price process that is consistent both with the consumption behavior of the aggregate of consumers who individually implement threshold policies, and the marginal cost pricing mechanism of the ISO. © 2012 IEEE.",,Aggregate behavior; Energy markets; Equilibrium point; Equilibrium price; Global consumption; Information structures; Marginal-cost pricing; Market outcomes; Model components; Optimal policies; Price process; Real time pricing; Regularity assumption; Threshold policies; Time interval; Wholesale markets; Aggregates; Commerce; Costs; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Consumer behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nikogosian V., Veith T.",The impact of ownership on price-setting in retail-energy markets-The German case,2012,6.0,"This paper analyzes whether public ownership has an impact on providers' price-setting. Under the assumption of more efficient energy provision which benefits customers a large number of former energy monopolists have been privatized in line with the liberalization of energy markets in Germany at the end of the 1990s. However, current re-municipalizations are justified by similar arguments in the public debate. Based on a dataset on the ownership structure of energy providers we find that public property or private property itself is not the decisive factor for lower retail and wholesale prices. Rather, a high ownership concentration leads to low prices, regardless of the type of owner. As public investors often seek total ownership of a provider, households, which are less willing to switch, benefit at least indirectly from public ownership. Tests for robustness of our results applying different owner and concentration measures confirm the results independently from the underlying estimation specification. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Ownership structure; Strategic price-setting; Vertical ownership relation,Concentration measures; Data sets; Energy markets; Germany; In-line; Ownership structure; Price setting; Private property; Public debate; Public investors; Public ownership; Strategic price-setting; Vertical ownership relation; Whole sale prices; Privatization; Sales; Costs; energy efficiency; energy market; liberalization; ownership; price determination; public sector; retailing; Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Webber G., Warrington J., Mariéthoz S., Morari M.",Communication limitations in iterative real time pricing for power systems,2011,6.0,"Iterative, or negotiated, pricing mechanisms have been of interest for decades as a systematic means of operating electricity markets, and have more recently been proposed as a way of dealing with the increased diversity of responsive market participants brought about by smart grid technologies and the increasing share of intermittent energy sources. One possibility is for the market coordinator to communicate iteratively with market participants to determine energy prices, on a receding horizon basis. Until now, little work has been carried out on the practicalities of implementing such pricing mechanisms, and yet because a market outcome must be cleared in real time, adequate communication speed and reliability is essential. The authors present a model of lossy and delayed communication over a network for such a negotiated pricing mechanism, derived from practical consideration of message timing, collection strategies and security. The convergence of the algorithm to an optimal dispatch is shown to be quite robust to frequent communication failures and delays.

"Cardell J., Anderson L., Tee C.Y.",The effect of wind and demand uncertainty on electricity prices and system performance,2010,6.0,"The uncertainty in wind power forecasts often results in forecast errors that require system operators to redispatch a power system in real time, once the actual wind generation is known. This paper analyzes the financial impact of this uncertainty in terms of the costs of redispatch. The analysis uses an optimal power flow (OPF) model in a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) framework to estimate these cost impacts as the difference in production cost and system lambda from a base case dispatch. Using a range of wind generation, reserve margins and assumptions for the ramp capability of non-wind generators, the results from the OPF and MCS show that wind power forecast uncertainty combined with load uncertainty can increase the variability in production cost for situations where moderate wind and load are expected, and will increase the variability in system lambda for the situation where low wind output and high load are expected. The results also show that on average there are few voltage violations. © 2010 IEEE.",Electricity markets; Interruptible load; Monte Carlo Simulation; Wind power generation,Cost impact; Demand uncertainty; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Financial impacts; Forecast errors; High load; Interruptible load; Load uncertainty; Monte Carlo Simulation; Optimal power flows; Power systems; Production cost; Real time; Redispatch; System operator; Voltage violation; Wind generation; Wind generators; Wind power forecast; Computer simulation; Cosmic ray detectors; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Monte Carlo methods; Ramp generators; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Electric load forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Mastroeni L., Vellucci P., Naldi M.",A reappraisal of the chaotic paradigm for energy commodity prices,2019,5.0,"Energy commodity prices have been examined over the last 20 years to detect the presence of chaos as an alternative to stochastic models, with contrasting results. In this paper, we wish to reassess the chaotic paradigm in the light of two new pieces of information with respect to the literature: the appearance of noise-aware estimation methods for the correlation entropy and the availability of longer time series. Our analysis shows that the literature has heavily underestimated the presence of noise, and that chaotic characteristics coexist with stochastic ones in the time series of prices. Through the recurrence quantification analysis, we have also observed the presence of intermittency, where periods of regular behaviour are replaced by periods of chaotic behaviour, which could explain the emergence of bubbles. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Chaos; Crude oil; Energy commodities; Entropy; Futures; Heating oil; Natural gas,Chaos theory; Costs; Crude oil; Entropy; Natural gas; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Time series; Time series analysis; Chaotic behaviour; Chaotic characteristics; Energy commodity; Estimation methods; Futures; Heating oil; Intermittency; Recurrence quantification analysis; Financial markets; commodity price; crude oil; energy market; entropy; estimation method; future prospect; natural gas; stochasticity; time series analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sapio A.,"Greener, more integrated, and less volatile? A quantile regression analysis of Italian wholesale electricity prices",2019,5.0,"This paper provides estimates of quantile regression models of the relationship between Italian day-ahead electricity prices, the supply of renewables and the inception of a new cable (SAPEI, linking Sardinia with the Italian peninsula), in the 2006–2015 time window. The results confirm the merit order effects detected in the existing literature, both for photovoltaics and wind power, more strongly in market conditions characterised by moderately low price levels and with some implied increase in volatility. The new cable has apparently challenged the ability of power generating companies to extract value through price spikes, has mitigated volatility, and its effects have been complementary with those of renewables. Effects from photovoltaics are more sensitive to robustness checks.

"Ng W.W.Y., Zhang J., Lai C.S., Pedrycz W., Lai L.L., Wang X.",Cost-sensitive weighting and imbalance-reversed bagging for streaming imbalanced and concept drifting in electricity pricing classification,2019,5.0,"In data streaming environments such as a smart grid, it is impossible to restrict each data chunk to have the same number of samples in each class. Hence, in addition to the concept drift, classification problems in streaming data environments are inherently imbalanced. However, streaming imbalanced and concept drifting problems in the power system and smart grid have rarely been studied. Incremental learning aims to learn the correct classification for the future unseen samples from the given streaming data. In this paper, we propose a new incremental ensemble learning method to handle both concept drift and class imbalance issues. The class imbalance issue is tackled by an imbalance-reversed bagging method that improves the true positive rate while maintains a low false positive rate. The adaptation to concept drift is achieved by a dynamic cost-sensitive weighting scheme for component classifiers according to their classification performances and stochastic sensitivities. The proposed method is applied to a case study for the electricity pricing in Australia to predict whether the price of New South Wales will be higher or lower than that of Victorias in a 24-h period. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with statistical significance in comparison to the state-of-the-art incremental learning methods. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity pricing; imbalanced classification; incremental Learning,Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Learning systems; Personnel training; Power markets; Bagging; Electricity pricing; Imbalanced classification; Incremental learning; Sensitivity; Smart grid; Smart power grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Quint D., Dahlke S.",The impact of wind generation on wholesale electricity market prices in the midcontinent independent system operator energy market: An empirical investigation,2019,5.0,"The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) is the second largest organized competitive wholesale electricity market in the U.S. Wholesale electricity prices in MISO have decreased over the past several years, as both natural gas prices have fallen, and large amounts of wind generation capacity have been added. Using an empirical econometric approach studying historical hourly real-time electricity prices, load, natural gas prices, and other MISO market data, a series of econometric models are estimated using historical data from 2008 to 2016, to identify the impact of increased wind generation on wholesale electricity prices in MISO. This is the first such empiric study for MISO, the largest wholesale electricity market by geography in the world. Furthermore, this is the first empiric study estimating impacts of wind generation on electricity price that utilizes a comprehensive set of predictor variables to control for many sources of potential bias. The results show a statistically significant impact of wind generation on real-time hourly MISO system prices, ranging from an estimated decrease of $0.14 to $0.34 per mega-watt hour, for each 100 mega-watt hours of additional wind generation. It is observed that the estimated marginal impacts of additional wind generation have declined over time. This is likely attributable to the long-term shifts in the supply and demand dynamics experienced in the MISO energy market, as well as to changes made to the MISO market structure to better accommodate variable generation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Energy economics; Wind energy,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Natural gas; Power markets; Wind power; Electricity prices; Empirical investigation; Energy economics; Independent system operators; Real-time electricity prices; Variable generations; Wholesale electricity; Wholesale electricity markets; Electric power generation; econometrics; electricity; empirical analysis; energy market; historical record; natural gas; power generation; price dynamics; resource economy; wind power; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We study the behaviour of the UK energy and non-energy intensive sectors firms in a real business cycle (RBC) model using unfiltered data. The model is econometrically estimated and tested by indirect inference. Output contraction during the Great Recession was largely caused by energy price and sector-specific productivity shocks, all of which are non-stationary and hence tend to dominate the sample variance decomposition. We also found that the channel by which the energy price shock reduces output in the model is via the terms of trade: these fall permanently when world energy prices increase and as substitutes for energy inputs are strictly limited there are few reactions via production channels. Therefore, there is no other way to balance the deteriorating current account than through lower domestic absorption. © 2018",Energy price shock; Great Recession; Output; Productivity shock; RBC; Unfiltered data,Productivity; Energy price shocks; Great Recession; Indirect inference; Output; Production channels; Specific productivity; Terms of trades; Unfiltered data; Costs; business cycle; data set; econometrics; energy market; price determination; productivity; United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bustos-Salvagno J., Fuentes F.H.",Electricity interconnection in Chile: Prices versus costs,2017,5.0,"Having a well-adapted transmission network is key for reaching a sustainable energy system, where generators and consumers participate in an efficient market. The purpose of the present research is to estimate the impact on the final prices of the interconnection of the two largest electrical systems in Chile. To this end, an econometric model is used in which prices, among other variables, are explained by the level of marginal costs in the system (opportunity cost), the degree of concentration in the market (market power), and the variability of marginal costs projected by the agents (risk). The data corresponds to bilateral contracts between generators and major clients, from 2006 to 2014. The basic results indicate that the interconnection would benefit final customers by reducing equilibrium contract prices, as a result of the decreased variability of expected marginal costs and a lower concentration of existing generating companies. This study's main contribution is to focus on the benefits of electricity interconnection under conditions of competition and risk, instead of using the simple estimation of direct costs, as has traditionally been done. © 2017 by the authors.",Chile; Contracts; Electricity; Energy policy; Market power; Risk; Transmission,Commerce; Contracts; Costs; Electricity; Energy policy; Risk perception; Risks; Transmissions; Bilateral contracts; Chile; Econometric model; Electrical systems; Electricity interconnections; Generating companies; Market Power; Sustainable energy systems; Electric power system interconnection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pereira J.P., Pesquita V., Rodrigues P.M.M.",The effect of hydro and wind generation on the mean and volatility of electricity prices in Spain,2017,5.0,"Many electricity markets are experiencing profound changes due to the large-scale deployment of renewable energy. This paper analyzes the effect of wind and hydro power on wholesale electricity prices. We focus on the Spanish market due to the high penetration of wind and hydro, and also the availability of data on water stored in Spanish dams. We estimate the impact of wind generation and hydro availability on the electricity price level and volatility through an ARX-GARCHX model. The results show that these two different renewables have different impacts on electricity prices: intermittent wind generation increases the price volatility, while dispatchable hydro reduces it. The results are consistent with hydropower plants behaving strategically and, given their zero marginal cost, dampening the otherwise higher price increases due to wind intermittency. Therefore, hydropower complements other intermittent renewables, not only operationally, but also economically. © 2017 IEEE.",,Commerce; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Power markets; Electricity prices; Hydropower plants; Intermittent renewables; Large-scale deployment; Price volatility; Renewable energies; Wholesale electricity; Wind generation; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ghosh D., Dutta S., Chakraborty S.",Multifractal behavior of Electricity Bid Price in Indian Energy Market,2016,5.0,"Abstract The bid price of power generation in a country is of extreme importance due to its obvious impact on the industry although it is difficult to explore correlation among cost of a product in any industry with fluctuations of biding price of power. This is due to the fact that the fluctuations are nonlinear and extremely complex. Recent years have witnessed the study of this type of complex systems with powerful tool involving fractal methodology. This paper reports for the first time in Indian scenario a study on the fluctuation pattern of biding price of power in five different bid areas of India with a robust and rigorous technique based on chaos and fractal behavior. The exhaustive study reveals very interesting patterns of the fluctuation process, namely in all domains, the fluctuations are multifractal in time and degree of multifractality is quite different in different zones. The data is completely new and has serious implications on product cost of industry and ultimately on stock price indices.

"Fanzeres B., Street A., Barroso L.A.",Contracting strategies for generation companies with ambiguity aversion on spot price distribution,2014,5.0,"Energy spot price is characterized by its high volatility and difficult prediction, representing a major risk for energy companies, especially those that rely on renewable generation. The typical approach employed by such companies to address their mid- and long-term optimal contracting strategy is to simulate a large set of paths for the uncertainty factors to characterize the probability distribution of the future income and, then, optimize the company portfolio to maximize its certainty equivalent. In practice, however, spot price modeling and simulation is a big challenge for agents due to its high dependence on parameters that are difficult to predict, e.g., GDP growth, demand variation, entrance of new market players, regulatory changes, just to name a few. Under this framework, decisions are made under ambiguity, which happens whenever the decision maker is aware that a given set of scenarios and probabilities represent only an approximation of the true underlying distribution. In this work, robust optimization is used to account for ambiguity aversion in the optimal contracting strategy of renewable generation companies. A case study with data from the Brazilian system is shown to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.",Ambiguity Aversion; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Forward and Capacity Contracts; Hybrid Robust and Stochastic Optimization; Power System Economics; Price-Quantity Risk; Renewable Generation,Costs; Decision making; Economics; Optimization; Value engineering; Ambiguity aversion; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Power system economics; Renewable generation; Stochastic optimizations; Probability distributions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thatte A.A., Choi D.-H., Xie L.",Analysis of locational marginal prices in look-ahead economic dispatch,2014,5.0,"This paper studies the impact of introducing look-ahead dispatch on locational marginal prices in real-time electricity markets. Due to the high forecast error and inter-temporal variability of renewable resources (e.g., wind and solar), many system operators are in the process of upgrading their market clearing engine from static economic dispatch-based ones to dynamic look-ahead economic dispatch-based ones. Compared with conventional static dispatch that calculates the optimal dispatch for the current operating interval, look-ahead dispatch calculates the optimal dispatch solution over multiple future time intervals. Look-ahead dispatch can obtain cost saving by pre-ramping some of the dispatched generators so that the system can more economically match forecast changes in net load (i.e., system load - renewable power output). In addition to the cost saving benefit, system operators in RTOs claim that look-ahead dispatch results in lower price volatility than static dispatch. In this paper, we attempt to demystify this industry claim and provide counterexamples to this claim. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between price volatility and some key factors such as system-wide ramping capability, the number of time intervals in look-ahead dispatch horizon, load pattern and forecast uncertainty. The simulation results are illustrated with numerical examples in the IEEE 14-bus system. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.",Electricity market; locational marginal price; look-ahead economic dispatch,Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Power markets; Scheduling; Economic Dispatch; Electricity market; Forecast uncertainty; Locational marginal prices; Market clearing engines; Price volatility; Renewable resource; Temporal variability; Electric load forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Market participants require an accurate price forecast to maximum their profits. Hereby, important events have to be considered instantly since the information value falls quickly.

Nevertheless, current forecast systems utilize exclusively structured attributes such as historical price, coal or gas and neglecting published messages. As an initial step, the paper will investigates if a forecast is possible through text data and if the overall forecast accuracy increases. To address the issue, a price trend classification is executed based on data and text mining techniques. The results are interesting. Unstructured text data enables an adequate forecast. Although, the combination of both data types can exceed the individual models itself.

"Panyakaew P., Damrongkulkamjorn P.",Hybrid computational method for step-bidding price optimal power flow,2013,5.0,This paper presents hybrid computational method for step-bidding price optimal power flow where the objective is to minimize total generation cost consisting of several step bidding prices from participated generators. The constraints are power balanced equations and system operating limits. The algorithm assumed a constant forecasted real power demand and no bilateral contracts. The hybrid computational method decomposes the calculations into two parts: the market dispatch part; and the power flow dispatch part. The bidding prices and the amount of power willing to produce are submitted from generators in form of several bidding blocks. The market dispatch part gives the results in terms of allocation of the bids of real power generations at each bus based only on the price offered without considering physical limits of the power systems. The power flow dispatch part minimizes the changes of real power generations resulting from the market dispatch part while satisfying power flow and necessary limits. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 30 bus system. Four interesting case studies have been illustrated with satisfying results. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.,Bidding price; Electricity market; Hybrid computational method; Optimal power flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Moazzami M., Hooshmand R.A.",Short-term nodal congestion price forecasting in a large-scale power market using ANN with genetic optimization training,2012,5.0,"In a daily power market, price and load forecasting are the most important signals for the market participants. In this paper, an accurate feed-forward neural network model with a genetic optimization Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation training algorithm is employed for short-term nodal congestion price forecasting in different zones of a large-scale power market. The use of genetic algorithms for neural network training optimization has a remarkable effect on the accuracy of price forecasting in a large-scale power market. The necessary data for neural network training are obtained by solving optimal power flow equations that take into account all effective constraints at any hour of the day in a single month. The structure of the neural network has 2 input signals of active and reactive powers for every load busbar in every hour of the programming model. These 2 signals are always available. In this study, an IEEE 118-bus power system is used to test the proposed method authenticity. This system is divided into 3 zones, and a neural network with genetic algorithm training optimization is employed for every zone. Performance of the proposed method is compared with ARIMA and GARCH time series for the same data. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is robust, efficient, and accurate.

"Uhlen K., Warland L., Grande O.S.",Model for area price determination and congestion management in joint power markets,2005,5.0,"The Market Splitting principle, used by Nord Pool in the Nordic day-ahead market, is an option also for the creation of a liberalized single market for electricity across the EU. However, improvements in the methodology for area price determination and congestion management are needed to make this model suitable for the more meshed and complex power system in central Europe. Alternative methodologies have been proposed where power flow calculations are included, and the main purpose of this paper is to present a simulation model which can be used to assess alternative methods for congestion management. The paper describes a simulation model where the Flow Based Market Coupling method is implemented and demonstrated. This method can be seen as a compromise between nodal pricing and market splitting (area pricing), where the criterion for congestion management is minimization of the Socio-economic Congestion Cost. The main principles for the proposed model are described, and case studies are performed on a generic system model in order to highlight the main characteristics of the method, and to summarise the main benefits and challenges that remain for a practical implementation of the Flow Based Market Coupling method. The case studies show that the method has the potential to solve the congestion management problem in a way that is optimal from a socio-economic point of view. The total costs of congestions are minimized, and the maximum differences in area prices are normally reduced. As a consequence the transmission system utilization is improved and the market players' risk referred to area prices is reduced. However, a successful implementation of the method depends heavily on the power flow model that is applied. It is of vital importance that this model is sufficiently accurate and continuously updated to predict the actual power flows on the main cross-border transmission corridors. © 2005 IEEE.",Congestion Management; Day ahead Market; Flow Based Market Coupling; Market Splitting; Power Exchange,Computer simulation; Cost effectiveness; Electric power systems; Electricity; Marketing; Optimization; Risk management; Congestion Management; Day ahead Market; Flow Based Market Coupling; Market Splitting; Power Exchange; Electric power distribution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Deng L., Li Z., Sun H., Guo Q., Xu Y., Chen R., Wang J., Guo Y.",Generalized locational marginal pricing in a heat-and-electricity-integrated market,2019,4.0,"In this paper, a new pricing method derived from the heat-and-electricity-integrated market clearing problem, referred to as generalized locational marginal pricing (GLMP), is presented. The market clearing problem is formulated by the independent system operator (ISO) to coordinate the electric power system with the district heating system by considering time-delay effects in the heating transfer process. GLMP is explained as the shadow price related to the nodal electricity balance and nodal heat balance at the optimal solution. Without considering network constraints, a simplified market clearing problem is proposed to illustrate the price linkage between heating and electricity markets through combined heat and power joint costs and feasible regions. Rational generation units will behave exactly as the ISO predicts by maximizing their individual producer surplus. Then, a compact form of the complete market clearing problem is employed to derive the detailed components of GLMP, namely, the extended marginal generation component, marginal loss component, and marginal congestion component. Furthermore, time-delay effects are reflected in the pricing. Numerical results verify the validity of component classification in GLMP and demonstrate that the proposed method can promote efficiency improvements and reduce cross-subsidies. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",combined heat and power; cost allocation; cross-subsidy; integrated energy system; Locational marginal pricing,Commerce; District heating; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Location; Numerical methods; Power generation; Time delay; Combined heat and power; Cost allocation; Cross subsidy; Integrated energy systems; Locational marginal pricing; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Smith M.S., Shively T.S.",Econometric modeling of regional electricity spot prices in the Australian market,2018,4.0,"Wholesale electricity markets are increasingly integrated via high voltage interconnectors, and inter-regional trade in electricity is growing. To model this, we consider a spatial equilibrium model of price formation, where constraints on inter-regional flows result in three distinct equilibria in prices. We use this to motivate an econometric model for the distribution of observed electricity spot prices that captures many of their unique empirical characteristics. The econometric model features supply and inter-regional trade cost functions, which are estimated using Bayesian monotonic regression smoothing methodology. A copula multivariate time series model is employed to capture additional dependence — both cross-sectional and serial — in regional prices. The marginal distributions are nonparametric, with means given by the regression means. The model has the advantage of preserving the heavy right-hand tail in the predictive densities of price. We fit the model to half-hourly spot price data in the five interconnected regions of the Australian national electricity market. The fitted model is then used to measure how both supply and price shocks in one region are transmitted to the distribution of prices in all regions in subsequent periods. Finally, to validate our econometric model, we show that prices forecast using the proposed model compares favorably with those from some benchmark alternatives. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian monotonic function estimation; Copula time series model; Intraday electricity prices,Commerce; Cost functions; Electric power system interconnection; Power markets; Time series; Australian national electricity markets; Electricity prices; Empirical characteristics; Monotonic functions; Multivariate time series models; Spatial equilibrium models; Time series modeling; Wholesale electricity markets; Costs; Bayesian analysis; econometrics; electricity supply; energy market; estimation method; numerical model; price dynamics; time series analysis; Australia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ilseven E., Göl M.",Hydro-Optimization-Based Medium-Term Price Forecasting Considering Demand and Supply Uncertainty,2018,4.0,"This paper proposes an electricity market model of Turkish electricity market for monthly and yearly electricity price forecasting in medium-term by means of supply and demand dynamics formed via a theoretical approach. The electricity market model created within this scope consists of three main components related to electricity demand, supply, and price segments along with hydro optimization submodel, which takes into account the nonlinear relation between supply and price. Electricity price is determined based on the intersection of demand curve and merit order curve that has dynamic behavior for dam-type hydrogeneration, import coal, and natural gas power plants. The paper aims to determine the range of possible electricity prices rather than a single price forecast by creating multiple scenarios based on the uncertainties in main variables affecting the electricity prices.

"Frimpong P.B., Antwi A.O., Brew S.E.Y.",Effect of Energy Prices on Economic Growth in the ECOWAS Sub-Region: Investigating the Channels Using Panel Data,2018,4.0,"The article empirically examines the effect of energy prices on economic growth within the Economic Community of West African States sub-region by acknowledging that the effect of energy prices on growth is quintessentially indirect and hence can be tracked through some channels. Exploiting the System Generalized Methods of Moments estimation technique for the period spanning 2002–2015, the results indicate that the overall effect of energy prices on economic growth is significantly negative. This effect propagates mainly through government consumption expenditure and investment, albeit its effect through real interest rate is positive. However, its negative effects on government consumption, investment, and exchange rate significantly overwhelm the positive effect from real interest rate. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",economic growth; energy prices; Ghana; System GMM,economic growth; economic relations; energy market; exchange rate; expenditure; interest rate; investment; panel data; price dynamics; regional economy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shang D.R.,Pricing of emergency dynamic microgrid power service for distribution resilience enhancement,2017,4.0,"Extreme weather events can cause significant damage to power distribution grids, leading to extended power outages. Intentional islanding enables the use of distributed energy resources (DERs) to power critical loads and accelerate grid restoration. In this study, an innovative dynamic microgrid islanding scheme was investigated as a means of enhancing distribution grid resilience. If customers in a dynamic microgrid request emergency electricity services during an outage, the question of how the distribution system operator should price the DER emergency power service arises. To answer this question, an economic load dispatch model was implemented in a single-bid auction market to forecast the market-clearing price of electricity in the dynamic microgrid island. The results show that the cost of emergency service is impacted by the power supply and demand in the island. When the combined heat and power plant capacity of the dynamic microgrid exceeded the demand, the market-clearing price of electricity in the island could be even less than the on-grid electricity price during normal periods. Thus, the dynamic microgrid scheme provides a low-cost means of supplying end-users with emergency power. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Distributed energy resources; Dynamic microgrid; Economic load dispatch; Electricity pricing; Intentional islanding,Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Costs; Distributed power generation; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Emergency services; Energy policy; Energy resources; Outages; Distributed Energy Resources; Economic load dispatch; Electricity pricing; Intentional islanding; Micro grid; Electric load dispatching; distribution system; electricity supply; energy market; energy resource; pricing policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rentschler J., Kornejew M.",Energy price variation and competitiveness: Firm level evidence from Indonesia,2017,4.0,"This paper uses firm survey data from the manufacturing and mining sectors in Indonesia, and investigates the extent to which energy prices affect competitiveness (proxied by profitability). Persistent regional price differences due to Indonesia's insular geography enable this study to show that energy prices have a small (but statistically significant) adverse long-run effect on competitiveness – though different energy types matter in different sectors. By estimating cross and own price elasticities and Uzawa-Allen partial elasticities of (inter-fuel) substitution, this study also shows that firms have the ability to respond to higher energy prices by adjusting their energy mix, i.e. substituting certain energy goods for others. Moreover, this study shows that firms also respond to higher energy prices by increasing energy efficiency, and by passing on costs to end-users. Nevertheless, these response measures are not sufficient to fully mitigate the adverse effect of energy prices on firms. Based on these results, policy recommendations are offered which are of immediate relevance for the design of energy pricing reforms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Competitiveness; Energy prices; Firms; Fossil fuel subsidies,Costs; Elasticity; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Adverse effect; Competitiveness; Energy prices; Firms; Own-price elasticities; Policy recommendations; Price difference; Response measures; Competition; competitiveness; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; fossil fuel; policy reform; price dynamics; profitability; subsidy system; Indonesia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Choi D.-H., Xie L.",Impact of power system network topology errors on real-time locational marginal price,2017,4.0,"This paper examines the impact of power transmission network topology change on locational marginal price (LMP) in real-time power markets. We consider the case where the false status of circuit breakers (CBs) that bypass topology error processing can generate an incorrect power system network topology, subsequently distorting the results of the state estimation and economic dispatch. The main goal of this paper is to assess the economic impact of this misconfigured network topology on real-time LMP in an entire power system with network congestion. To this end, we start with our prior result, a simple and analytical congestion price equation, which can be applied to any single line congestion scenario. This equation can be extended to better understand the degree to which the LMP at any bus changes due to any line status error. Furthermore, it enables a rigorous analysis of the relationship between the change in LMP at any bus with respect to any line error and various physical/economical grid conditions such as the bidding prices for marginal generators and the locations of the congested/erroneous lines. Numerical examples on the impact analysis of this topology error are illustrated in IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems. © 2017, The Author(s).",Economic dispatch; Locational marginal price; Power market; Power system network topology,Commerce; Costs; Electric circuit breakers; Electric power transmission networks; Errors; Location; Numerical methods; Power markets; Scheduling; Topology; Economic Dispatch; Line congestions; Locational marginal prices; Network congestions; Power system networks; Real time power market; Rigorous analysis; Topology error processing; Electric load dispatching,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jain A.K., Srivastava S.C.",Price Responsive Demand Management of an Industrial Buyer in Day-ahead Electricity Market,2017,4.0,"An industrial buyer, who can reschedule its production plan, may develop strategic bid by shifting its demand from high price period to low price period. Based on this concept, a new optimization formulation has been proposed to develop bidding strategy of such buyers considering Price Responsive Demand Shifting (PRDS). Since the bidding strategy of the buyer depends upon the market clearing price, which is volatile/uncertain due to various factors like gaming behavior of participants, demand forecasting error, transmission congestion etc, the proposed optimization problem is formulated as a stochastic linear problem, comprising of two sub-problems. The first sub-problem represents the market clearing process by the System Operator, which is formulated to maximize the social welfare of the market participants, while the second sub-problem aims at maximizing the purchase cost saving of the industrial buyer. The optimal bidding strategy has been obtained by solving these two sub-problems considering hourly market clearing for 24-hour scheduling period. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested on a 5-bus system and modified IEEE 30-bus system. Results obtained with the demand shifting based bidding strategy have been compared with those obtained with a Conventional Price Quantity (CPQ) bid strategy. It has been observed that the proposed approach leads to enhancement in the purchase cost saving as compared to the CPQ and meets the energy consumption targets of the industrial buyer. © 2017 by De Gruyter 2017.",electricity market; optimal bidding strategy; price responsive demand shifting; stochastic linear optimization; uniform market clearing price,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Linear programming; Optimization; Production control; Sales; Stochastic systems; Day-ahead electricity market; Linear optimization; Market Clearing Price; Optimal bidding strategy; Optimization formulations; Price responsive demand; Price responsive demand shifting; Transmission congestion; Power markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lebedev D., Rosin A., Kutt L.",Simulation of real time electricity price based Energy Management System,2016,4.0,"The aim of the case study was to determine profitability of Energy Management System (EMS) in the intraday market like Elbas (Nord Pool Spot). To optimize the operation of EMS, a Demand Response (DR) algorithm was used for the calculation of a battery bank charge-discharge schedule (BCDS) taking into account the volatility in the Real-Time price (RTP). The profits are gained from importing and storing more energy at low price periods while decreasing the imported power from the grid at high price periods and dispatching the stored energy for load demands. The forecast procedure analyzes the history of the energy price for a predefined back-time period and optimizes the BCDS to bring the highest profit to the end customer. The results are composed from typical parameters of a household's energy demand applied in EMS. The results obtained were compared with those from laboratory obtained by the Day-Ahead price based control algorithm.

"Ntakou E., Caramanis M.",Enhanced convergence rate of inequality constraint shadow prices in PMP algorithm cleared distribution power markets,2016,4.0,"The extension of Transmission Locational Marginal Cost Prices (LMP) to Distribution node LMPs, or DLMPs, is a prerequisite for efficient demand response that may support significant integration of Renewables. AC load flow and non-linear distribution cost modeling needed to this end, render centralized market clearing Algorithms intractable, with Distributed Proximal Message Passing (PMP) Algorithms offering what appears to be the only scalable and tractable alternative. DLMPs of real and reactive power are associated with equality power balance constraint shadow prices at each distribution node, while, allowable voltage limit inequality constraints are associated with inequality constraint shadow prices. This paper addresses the slower convergence rate of voltage constraint shadow price estimates in PMP algorithms. In particular, we use first order optimality conditions to derive relations that characterize the interaction of equality and inequality shadow prices across the distribution network, and employ them to construct a filter that enhances the estimation accuracy of voltage inequality constraint shadow prices. We show that use of this filter results in a significant speedup of the PMP algorithm's convergence rate for both voltage shadow prices as well as DLMPs. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bigerna S., Bollino C.A.",Optimal price design in the wholesale electricity market,2016,4.0,"In this paper, we construct an optimal price design mechanism to determine the equilibrium in the day-Ahead electricity market, specifically aimed at solving the uncomfortable conflict between conventional thermal sources (CTS) and renewable energy sources (RES). We find that the actual hourly market design is inadequate to achieve an efficient solution in the presence of a large and increasing share of RES. It is not conducive to catalyzing the correct price signal for future investments and does not take into account welfare considerations. Our proposal for a new market design is based on three main pillars. We state pro-competitive incentives to CTS participation in the market. We take into full account the opportunity cost of RES for society and propose correct price signals on the demand side through an optimal Ramsey pricing scheme. We show an empirical application to the Italian electricity market, using empirical measures of LCOE for RES and empirical estimation of heterogeneous buyers' behavior. The results show improvement in efficiency and welfare in the Italian electricity market with respect to the existing zonal market prices for suppliers and uniform price for buyers.

The proposed model does not predict the exact value of future electricity price, but the class to which it belongs, established with respect to pre-specified threshold. This strategy is proposed since for some applications, the exact value of future prices is not required for the decision-making process. A feature selection technique is applied to identify the relevant attributes to the decision tree. Some decision tree algorithms are investigated such as CART and C5.0. These results are compared with NN, another classification technique commonly used. In addition, ensemble models combining CART, C5.0 and NN two by two are analyzed. The prediction time horizon is 1 week ahead and the system used is the Brazilian market, which adopts a cost-based centralized dispatch with unique characteristics of price behavior. The results show that an ensemble model of C5.0 and CART produced high accuracy of 99.3%, and can be an attractive tool to mitigate risks in purchasing power. © 2015 IEEE.",classification; decision tree; electricity price forecasting; feature selection,Algorithms; Classification (of information); Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Power markets; Classification models; Classification technique; Decision making process; Decision-tree algorithm; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Prediction time horizon; Selection techniques; Data mining,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sapio A.,The impact of renewables on electricity prices and congestion in a regime switching model: Evidence from the italian grid,2015,4.0,"In this paper, the cross-zonal impact of renewable energy (RE) on electricity prices is assessed by means of a time-varying regime switching model, focusing on the highly congested line connecting Sicily with the Italian peninsula. In the base regime, there is no congestion and the price in Sicily (which equals the systemmarginal price) depends on national electricity demand and RE supply. In the congested regime, the Sicilian price depends on the local electricity demand and RE supply, as well as on market power by local generators. The transition between regimes is modeled through a dynamic probit, including, as explanatory variables, the RE supply on both sides of the potentially congested line. The regime switching model is estimated using hourly data from the Italian dayahead electricity market for the year 2012. As shown by results, congestion is determined by the total amount of renewables in mainland Italy, but when the RE supply is disaggregated into different sources, one finds that congestion is mainly due to photovoltaics (from the peninsula) and hydropower (wherever located), whereas wind power has a negative effect on congestion regardless of localization. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,Commerce; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Photovoltaic effects; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Electricity demands; Electricity prices; Explanatory variables; Italian day-ahead electricity markets; Italian peninsula; Regime switching model; Renewable energies; System marginal price; Stochastic models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Sossan F., Bindner H.",A comparison of algorithms for controlling DSRs in a control by price context using hardware-in-the-loop simulation,2012,4.0,"With future increasing of electric energy production from fluctuating sources, the need for regulating power will rise and conventional power plants that today provide all power system ancillary services could not have the capability and the flexibility of providing it. Demand Side Resource, DSRs, are electric loads whose power consumption can be shifted without having a big impact on the primary services they are supplying and they are suitable for being controlled according the needs of regulating power in the electric power system. In this paper the performances and the aggregate responses provided by three algorithms for controlling electric space heating through a broadcasted price signal are compared. The algorithms have been tested in a software platform with a population of buildings using a hardware-in-the-loop approach that allows to feedback into the simulation the thermal response of a real office building; the experimental results of using a model predictive controller for heating a real building in a variable price context are also presented.

Real-time balancing power is usually provided through various market solutions and thus, the prices on such markets will be affected by the increase in wind power production. Consequently, there exist a need for planning and simulation tools concerning the increased balancing demand. This paper therefore describes an estimation model for real-time balancing prices in systems where significant levels of wind power will be added.

"Gibescu M., Van Zwet E.W., Christie R.D., Kling W.L.",Optimal bidding strategy for mixed-portfolio producers in a dual imbalance pricing system,2008,4.0,"In this work we construct an optimal bidding strategy for an energy producer who owns a mixed portfolio of conventional fossil-fuelled plants and renewable resources of stochastic output such as wind farms. The energy market setup consists of a day-ahead spot, in combination with a dual-pricing imbalance market, as can be found e.g. in the Netherlands. A risk-neutral producer seeks to maximize the expectation of its random profit from conventional and renewable energy sales, under the predictive probability distributions of wind power production, day-ahead spot price and imbalance prices for surplus and deficit production. Our main result is a price-quantity curve, which the producer should submit in the day-ahead bidding process. This work builds upon our previous results on the optimal bidding curve of a wind producer alone. Here we show that pooling wind and conventional resources yields strictly higher expected revenues than separate operation. Essentially, the expensive fossil-fuelled units are used only as backup for wind energy shortages, while bidding from renewable sources becomes more aggressive in the presence of conventional back-up that can insulate from imbalance penalties. We validate this new method by computing and comparing yearly revenues for a mixed portfolio producer typical of the Netherlands, using data from the day-ahead market operated by the Amsterdam Power Exchange and the imbalance market run by the Dutch system operator TenneT.",Energy markets; Forecasting; Imbalance pricing; Optimization under uncertainty; Wind energy,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Day ahead market; Energy markets; Optimal bidding strategy; Optimization under uncertainty; Renewable energy sales; Renewable resource; Renewable sources; Wind power production; Power markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Bento P., Nunes H., Pombo J., do Rosário Calado M., Mariano S.",Daily operation optimization of a hybrid energy system considering a short-term electricity price forecast scheme,2019,3.0,"The scenario where the renewable generation penetration is steadily on the rise in an increasingly atomized system, with much of the installed capacity “sitting” on a distribution level, is in clear contrast with the “old paradigm” of a natural oligopoly formed by vertical structures. Thereby, the fading of the classical producer–consumer division to a broader prosumer “concept” is fostered. This crucial transition will tackle environmental harms associated with conventional energy sources, especially in this age where a greater concern regarding sustainability and environmental protection exists. The “smoothness” of this transition from a reliable conventional generation mix to a more volatile and “parti-colored"" one will be particularly challenging, given escalating electricity demands arising from transportation electrification and proliferation of demand-response mechanisms. In this foreseeable framework, proper Hybrid Energy Systems sizing, and operation strategies will be crucial to dictate the electric power system’s contribution to the “green” agenda. This paper presents an optimal power dispatch strategy for grid-connected/off-grid hybrid energy systems with storage capabilities.

We extend the Student’s t and the exponential generalised beta distribution of the second kind stochastic location and stochastic seasonal DCS models. We consider the generalised t distribution as an alternative for the error term and also consider dynamic specifications of volatility. We use a unique dataset of spot electricity prices for El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama. We consider two data windows for each country, which are defined with respect to the liberalisation and development process of the energy market in Central America. We study the identification of a wide range of DCS specifications, likelihood-based model performance, time-series components of energy prices, maximum likelihood parameter estimates, the discounting property of conditional score, and out-of-sample forecast performance.

Ten minutes averaged wind data are obtained from LIDAR over the period of twelve months and it is compared with the 38 years' data from weather station with the objective of determining the wind resources at the wind-farm. The performance of one of the wind turbines located in the wind-farm is assessed by comparing the wind power potential of the wind turbine with its actual power production. Our analysis shows that the wind farm under study is rated as 'good' in terms of wind power production and has wind power density of 479 W/m2. The annual wind-farm's income is estimated based on the real-data collected from the wind turbines. The effect of price of electricity and the spot prices of Norwegian-Swedish green certificate on the income will be illustrated by means of a Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) approach.

Since the model belongs to the log-GARCH class, the model is robust to spikes or jumps, allows for a rich variety of volatility dynamics without restrictive positivity constraints, can be estimated equation-by-equation by means of standard methods even in the presence of feedback, and allows for Dynamic Conditional Correlations (DCCs) that can – optionally – be estimated subsequent to the volatilities. We use the model to study the hourly day-ahead system prices at Nord Pool, and find extensive evidence of periodic volatility and volatility feedback. We also find that volatility is characterised by (positive) leverage in one third of the hours, and that a DCC model provides a better fit of the conditional correlations than a Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",ARCH; Dynamic conditional correlations; Electricity prices; Exponential GARCH; Financial return; Leverage; Log-GARCH; Multivariate GARCH; Nord Pool; Volatility,Arches; Economics; Energy resources; Dynamic conditional correlations; Electricity prices; Exponential GARCH; Financial returns; Leverage; Log-GARCH; Multivariate GARCH; Nord Pool; Volatility; Costs; correlation; electricity; estimation method; multivariate analysis; numerical model; price dynamics; regression analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cross J., Nguyen B.H.",Time varying macroeconomic effects of energy price shocks: A new measure for China,2018,3.0,"In this paper, we examine the effects of world energy price shocks on China's macroeconomy over the past two decades. We begin by showing that the use of oil prices as a proxy for more general energy price dynamics is not appropriate for the case of China. Having established this fact, we propose a new energy price index which accurately reflects the structure of China's energy expenditure shares, and intertemporal fluctuations in international energy prices. We then employ a sufficiently rich set of time varying VARs, identified through a new set of agnostic sign restrictions, to estimate the effects of energy price shocks on China's macroeconomy. Our main result is that positive energy price shocks generate statistically significant reductions in real GDP growth and increases in inflation. Interestingly, both the sets of responses have consistently declined over the sample period. Next, the interest rate responses are found to be consistently positive over the sample period. Given the aforementioned stagflation result, this suggests that the PBOC is more focused on inflation stabilization as compared to facilitating output growth. All presented results are shown to be robust under both official national data and those developed by Chang et al. (2015), thus strengthening our conclusion that energy price shocks have significant time varying effects on China's macroeconomy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",China; Energy prices; Sign restrictions; Stochastic volatility; Time varying parameters,Economic analysis; Stochastic systems; China; Energy prices; Sign restrictions; Stochastic volatility; Time varying parameter; Costs; energy market; expenditure; Gross Domestic Product; inflation; interest rate; macroeconomics; oil supply; parameterization; price dynamics; stochasticity; China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Herrero I., Rodilla P., Batlle C.",Enhancing intraday price signals in U.S. ISO markets for a better integration of variable energy resources,2018,3.0,"Efficient operation of power systems increasingly requires accurate forecasting of load and variable energy resources (VER) production, along with flexible resources and markets, capable of adapting to changing conditions in the intraday horizon. It is of utmost importance to reflect these needs in price signals, to align the incentives of market agents with the new challenges. The two‑settlement system used by U.S. ISOs falls short to provide efficient intraday economic signals and a cost reflective allocation of intraday rescheduling costs. This paper advocates for a multi‑settlement system, which entails calculating intraday prices as forecasts are updated and re‑schedules are executed. This approach incorporates more granular prices, as in European intraday markets, while keeping the efficient centralized dispatch logic of the ISO model. A stylized case example illustrates the virtues of a multi‑settlement system, which sends cost reflective signals, and consequently facilitates VER integration. Copyright © 2018 by the IAEE.

"Vendries Algarin J., Hawkins T.R., Marriott J., Khanna V.",Effects of Using Heterogeneous Prices on the Allocation of Impacts from Electricity Use: A Mixed-Unit Input-Output Approach,2017,3.0,"Economic input-output life cycle assessment (IO-LCA) models allow for quick estimation of economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with goods and services. IO-LCA models are usually built using economic accounts and differ from most process-based models in their use of economic transactions, rather than physical flows, as the drivers of supply-chain GHG emissions. GHG emissions estimates associated with input supply chains are influenced by the price paid by consumers when the relative prices between individual consumers are different. We investigate the significance of the allocation of GHG emissions based on monetary versus physical units by carrying out a case study of the U.S. electricity sector. We create parallel monetary and mixed-unit IO-LCA models using the 2007 Benchmark Accounts of the U.S. economy and sector specific prices for different end users of electricity. This approach is well suited for electricity generation because electricity consumption contributes a significant share of emissions for most processes, and the range of prices paid by electricity consumers allows us to explore the effects of price on allocation of emissions. We find that, in general, monetary input-output models assign fewer emissions per kilowatt to electricity used by industrial sectors than to electricity used by households and service sectors, attributable to the relatively higher prices paid by households and service sectors. This fact introduces a challenging question of what is the best basis for allocating the emissions from electricity generation given the different uses of electricity by consumers and the wide variability of electricity pricing. © 2016 by Yale University",energy accounting; environmental input-output analysis; industrial ecology; input-output life cycle assessment (IO-LCA); mixed-unit input-output model; physical input-output tables (PIOT),Costs; Economics; Electric power utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Supply chains; Energy accounting; Environmental input-output analysis; Industrial ecology; Input output model; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Physical input output table; Electric power generation; commodity price; electricity; electricity generation; emission inventory; energy market; energy use; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; input-output analysis; model; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ergemen Y.E., Haldrup N., Rodríguez-Caballero C.V.",Common long-range dependence in a panel of hourly Nord Pool electricity prices and loads,2016,3.0,"Equilibrium electricity spot prices and loads are often determined simultaneously in a day-ahead auction market for each hour of the subsequent day. Hence daily observations of hourly prices take the form of a periodic panel rather than a time series of hourly observations. We consider novel panel data approaches to analyse the time series and the cross-sectional dependence of hourly Nord Pool electricity spot prices and loads for the period 2000–2013. Hourly electricity prices and load data are characterized by strong serial long-range dependence in the time series dimension in addition to strong seasonal periodicity, and along the cross-sectional dimension, i.e. the hours of the day, there is a strong dependence which necessarily has to be accounted for in order to avoid spurious inference when focusing on the time series dependence alone. The long-range dependence is modelled in terms of a fractionally integrated panel data model and it is shown that both prices and loads consist of common factors with long memory and with loadings that vary considerably during the day. Due to the competitiveness of the Nordic power market the aggregate supply curve approximates well the marginal costs of the underlying production technology and because the demand is more volatile than the supply, equilibrium prices and loads are argued to identify the periodic power supply curve. The estimated supply elasticities are estimated from fractionally co-integrated relations and range between 0.5 and 1.17 with the largest elasticities being estimated during morning and evening peak hours. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity prices and loads; Fractional integration; Long memory; Panel data models,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Elasticity; Electric power systems; Stochastic systems; Time series; Cross sectional dependence; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Fractional integration; Long memory; Long range dependence; Panel data models; Production technology; Power markets; competitiveness; electricity industry; electricity supply; energy market; panel data; price dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Schneider I., Roozbehani M.",Endogenous error pricing for energy imbalance settlements,2016,3.0,"This paper models the bidding behavior of energy market participants under an endogenous imbalance pricing mechanism. Wind producers are increasingly required to settle their day-ahead electricity bids based on their actual production in real-time, which impacts their bidding behavior and curtailment decisions. The real-time price that players pay or receive in order to settle their deviations is based on the realized forecast errors in wind and demand, so it is affected by the strategies of all wind producers in the market. We formulate a two-stage game where players place ex-ante bids for energy production and then may curtail their realized output in real-time. Then, we find the subgame perfect equilibrium strategy for producer bidding and curtailment. Profit-maximizing bids are equal to the expected value of players' post-curtailment production values. The results show that the endogenous pricing mechanism leads to better tradeoffs of system efficiency and risk compared to the case where penalties are exogenous. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hreinsson E.B.,Optimal long term hydro scheduling linked to average electricity market prices,2016,3.0,"Traditionally, the Icelandic, island, hydro-based power system has been scheduled and planned based on local, isolated demand of two types: General Demand (GD) and the flat, now dominating Energy Intensive Industry (EII) demand. Thus a local load profile determines the scheduled operation, perhaps causing underutilization of resources, and water spillage. This limited flexibility is built into an isolated system, but interruptible EII contracts have served to increase the utilization to better meet the variable resource inflow (Water, geothermal steam). However, an access to a larger market would mitigate and change radically this limitation. Therefore a model based estimate of possible benefits is all important, when considering a UK-Iceland HVDC submarine link. © 2016 IEEE.",,Commerce; Geothermal water resources; Water resources; Energy intensive industries; Geothermal steam; Hydro scheduling; Icelandics; Icelands; Isolated systems; Local loads; Model-based OPC; Power markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Luo C., Huang Y.-F., Gupta V.",Dynamic pricing and energy management strategy for EV charging stations under uncertainties,2016,3.0,"This paper presents a dynamic pricing and energy management framework for electric vehicle (EV) charging service providers. To set the charging prices, the service providers faces three uncertainties: the volatility of wholesale electricity price, intermittent renewable energy generation, and spatial-temporal EV charging demand. The main objective of our work here is to help charging service providers to improve their total profits while enhancing customer satisfaction and maintaining power grid stability, taking into account those uncertainties. We employ a linear regression model to estimate the EV charging demand at each charging station, and introduce a quantitative measure for customer satisfaction. Both the greedy algorithm and the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm are employed to derive the optimal charging prices and determine how much electricity to be purchased from the wholesale market in each planning horizon. Simulation results show that DP algorithm achieves an increased profit (up to 9%) compared to the greedy algorithm (the benchmark algorithm) under certain scenarios. Additionally, we observe that the integration of a low-cost energy storage into the system can not only improve the profit, but also smooth out the charging price fluctuation, protecting the end customers from the volatile wholesale market. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The voltage stability is one of the major criteria for preserving system security. Structure of Competitive market for reactive power estimation is rising in recent trends. The reactive power is very essential for maintaining the voltage profile in transmission line. Thus the reactive power pricing and its estimation importance is focused in this paper. Here the cost function of reactive power is developed and calculated most accurately based on generator as reactive power source. This cost function for the generator is modified in some prescribed manner and it is implemented using optimal power flow in MATLAB. The proposed method is realized in IEEE 9 bus and IEEE 30-bus system.

"Shcherbakova A., Kleit A., Blumsack S., Cho J., Lee W.",Effect of increased wind penetration on system prices in Korea's electricity markets,2014,3.0,"In this paper, we examine the effect of increased wind penetration on system marginal prices (SMPs) in South Korea's electricity market. Korea's renewable portfolio standard (RPS) went into effect in 2012, with a goal of increasing the share of renewable generation to 10% of the total load by 2022. We examine the output of wind installations across the Korean peninsula and simulate an increase in wind penetration consistent with Korea's RPS targets. Under a variety of assumptions on demand elasticity, we find that higher shares of wind generation in total supply reduce both the average SMP and its variation. In particular, we find that wind energy output on the Korean peninsula is more correlated with peak electricity demand than has been reported for other regions. The per-unit value of wind energy to owners of wind assets is thus higher for South Korea than would be the case for European or North American locations with a similar mix of fuels other than wind.

The simulations were performed as one of the final deliverables of the E-Price project. The market design under simulation includes the introduction of double sided markets for ancillary services for power balancing, in which balance responsible parties have the possibility to hedge their position in terms of energy balance. The model, which includes both day-ahead and real-time decisions, has been exposed to imbalances of three categories. These imbalances are power plant trips, wind power forecasting errors and wind power fluctuations. As such it is evaluated how the proposed power balancing mechanisms perform. The simulations show that the proposed double sided market for ancillary services gives proper incentives to balance responsible parties to minimize their imbalance as well as to provide available resources to the balancing systems in place. © 2013 IEEE.",Automatic Generation Control; Economic Dispatch; Power Markets; Unit Commitment,Ancillary service; Automatic generation control; Economic Dispatch; Power fluctuations; Power markets; Real-time decisions; Unit Commitment; Wind power forecasting; Scheduling; Wind power; Commerce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mody S., Steffen T.",Optimal charging of EVs in a real time pricing electricity market,2013,3.0,"The idea of grid friendly charging is to use electricity from the grid to charge batteries when electricity is available in surplus and cheap. There are several ways of achieving this, for example using droop control, using night time electricity tariffs, or using smart metering. The goal is twofold: to avoid putting additional load on the electricity grid and power generation, and to reduce the cost to the consumer. This paper looks at the saving potential when charging an electric car using real time tariffs provided by a smart meter, using the Ameren tariffs in Illinois as an example. If prices are known in advance (day-ahead pricing), the optimization only requires picking the cheapest time slots for charging the battery. Further savings can be made by using real time prices that are not known in advance, but the optimization problem then depends on price prediction models, and it becomes much more difficult to solve. This paper presents a simple suboptimal approach, and it quantifies the potential improvements that could be made using more sophisticated price predictions. The result is that cost savings in the order of about 50 USD (1/3 of the electricity costs) are feasible if a fast charger is used using real time pricing. The scale of the savings is such that complex optimization strategies are not worthwhile, and for the foreseeable future simple solutions are expected to be more cost effective.

"Hodge T., Dahl C.A.",Power marketer pricing behavior in the California Power Exchange,2012,3.0,"Various studies have examined whether market power abuses by independent electricity generators contributed to the demise of the California Power Exchange (PX). However, the behavior of wholesale power marketers has generally been overlooked. To fill this gap, our paper focuses on the pricing behavior of five major power marketers in the California PX during 2000: Duke Energy Trading & Marketing, Reliant Energy Services, Dynegy Power Marketing, Enron Power Marketing, and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading. Our unique data set, collected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during an investigation of energy market pricing manipulation, allows us to assess the level of market power using the conduct parameter pricing model. The estimated conduct parameter allows us to determine power marketer pricing behavior is competitive, Cournot, or collusive. Our results indicate that Duke Energy and Reliant were exercising market power when pricing the wholesale electricity they sold in the California PX during 2000.

"Montero J.-M., Fernández-Avilés G., García M.-C.",Estimation of Asymmetric Stochastic Volatility Models: Application to Daily Average Prices of Energy Products,2010,3.0,"Energy supply and demand, and as a consequence energy prices, are likely to represent one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century. Commodity markets exhibit increased volatility when there is little or no underutilized supply capability to meet natural fluctuations in demand. In the case of energy markets, the large capital requirements and significant lead times associated with energy production and delivery make them more susceptible to the imbalances in supply capability and demand. Energy price volatility has destructive impact on market agents, and this impact is intensified when the prices exhibit asymmetric volatility. This article pursues two aspects of the issue. First we consider general aspects, especially the asymmetric pattern of volatility of daily returns of different types of energy products. Then, we analyze the behaviour of daily returns by using traditional models of volatility that include AGARCH, TGARCH, EGARCH, and ARSV strategies, as well as a threshold asymmetric autoregressive stochastic volatility (TA-ARSV) model that we propose. The energy products considered in this analysis are probably the most relevant energy products for the economic activity of the nations and the economic relations between countries: Crude Oil (OPEC reference basket and London Brent index), Gasoline, Natural Gas, Butane, and Propane.

With comprehensive consideration of the changing rules of the day-ahead electricity price, a day-ahead electricity price forecasting method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and grey GM(1,2) model is proposed, in which the moving average method is used to process the raw data series, and the grey GM(1,2) model is used to the processed series and the PSO is used to minimize the weighted mean absolute percent error to further optimize the grey background value. The numerical example based on the historical data of the PJM market shows that the method can reflect the characteristics of electricity price better and the forecasting accuracy can be improved virtually compared with the conventional GM(1,2) model.

"Li H.-D., Zhang J., Xiao L., Li H.-P., Feng Y.",Application of DS evidence theory in combined price forecasting,2008,3.0,"The method of combined forecasting establishes multiple forecasting models, and calculates the final results by summing up the weighted results of every model. However, it is hard to determine the weights of the combination. The weights of the combination are determined by the history predicted errors in the traditional method of combination. Since it does not take into account of the external environmental influencing factors in forecasting a point price, the historical predicted errors have impact on the forecasting result. Actually, the forecasting precision of different methods is influenced by the environmental factors directly. This paper discusses how to apply DS evidence theory into combined price forecasting with multiple models. The main framework of research is as follow: firstly, modeling data is used to train multiple models, which produces the model and training errors applied in price forecasting; secondly, training errors are converted into credibility of each model in predicting the point. Then, as an output value the credibility is outputted, while the environmental factors of this moment are input variables. As a result, credibility training and forecasting model is built up; thirdly, the environmental factors are regarded as objected input, and the built credibility forecasting model is used to forecast the credibility; fourthly, several models are used to forecast the price respectively; fifthly, DS evidential reasoning method is used to synthetically calculate conformity the credibility of each model, and the combined weight of each model is obtained; sixthly, the forecasted price of multiple models is combined with the predicted weight and the final price is obtained. Finally, a study case serves to analyze and compare combined price forecasting based on DS evidence theory with equally weighted average combined forecasting and variance-covariance optimized combined forecasting and the results illustrate that this model is valid. © 2008 DRPT.",Combined forecasting; Evidence theory; Power market; Price forecasting,Deregulation; Dielectric relaxation; Electric load forecasting; Errors; Industrial economics; Technology; Combined forecasting; D-S evidence theory; Environmental factors; Evidence theory; Evidential reasoning; External-; Forecasting models; Forecasting precision; Influencing factors; Input variables; International conferences; Modeling data; Multiple modeling; Power market; Power technologies; Price forecasting; Training errors; Weighted averaging; Forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kang C., Guo L., Bai L., Xu R., He J., Xu K.",Joint analysis of power system reliability and market price considering the uncertainties of load forecasts,2007,3.0,"Reliability evaluation plays an important role in power system planning and operation. In electricity market, the uncertainties of market price and load forecasting will also greatly affect system reliability. This paper presents a novel model and algorithm for joint analysis of power system reliability and market price considering the uncertainties of load forecasts. After a process of reliability evaluation and market simulation, the results include system reliability indices and the probability distribution function of price can be achieved. If the forecasting load is a certain value, the probability distribution of the market price, as well as Expected Value and Standard Deviation, can be obtained directly. Furthermore, a stochastic load model is established to describe the uncertainty of future system load. Taking the uncertainty of load forecasting into consideration, we can suppose the forecasting load to be a random variable. Under different load levels, the market price has different probability distributions. So, the full distribution is the weighted sum of each distribution. In this algorithm, units' uncertain bids and output are incorporated together as well as the probability of forecasting load. In order to show the efficiency of the proposed models and algorithms, two numerical samples are studied in details in this paper. A simple system which contains 4 units is analyzed firstly. The calculations of system reliability indices considering uncertain load forecasting are demonstrated within this example. Consequently, IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) composed of 32 units is utilized to simulate the real electricity market. The probability distribution of market price under different load levels are calculated and then depicted by figures. Through the study, the expectant unit output and its income are also analyzed and some instructive conclusions are yielded which are useful for the participants of the market. Based on these results, it is also possible to evaluate the risk involved by generating units when system load forecasting is uncertain. The sample studies indicate that the model established is efficient. © 2006 IEEE.",Electricity market; Electricity price; Power system; Probability distribution; Reliability evaluation; Uncertainty,Electricity market; Electricity price; Reliability evaluation; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Probability distributions; Reliability analysis; Stochastic models; Uncertainty analysis; Electric power systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yoshikazu I., Shozo T.",Analysis of price changes in artificial double auction markets consisting of multi-agents using Genetic Programming for learning and its applications,2007,3.0,"In this paper, we show the analysis of price changes in artificial double auction markets consisting of multi-agents who learn from past experiences based on the Genetic Programming (GP) and its applications. For simplicity, we focus on the double auction in an electricity market. Agents in the market are allowed to buy or sell items (electricity) depending on the prediction of situations. Each agent has a pool of individuals (decision functions) represented in tree structures to decide bid price by using the past result of auctions. A fitness of each individual is defined by using successful bids and a capacity utilization rate of production units for a production of items, and agents improve their individuals based on the GP to get higher return in coming auctions. In simulation studies, changes of bid prices and returns of bidders are discussed depending on demand curves of customers and the weight between an average profit obtained by successful bids and the capacity utilization rate of production units. The validation of simulation studies is examined by comparing results with classical models and price changes in real double auction markets. Since bid prices bear relatively large changes, we apply an approximate method for a control by forcing agents stabilize the changes in bid prices. As a result, we see the stabilization scheme of bid prices in double auction markets is not realistic, then it is concluded that the market contains substantial instability.

"Morstyn T., Teytelboym A., Hepburn C., McCulloch M.D.",Integrating P2P Energy Trading with Probabilistic Distribution Locational Marginal Pricing,2020,2.0,"This paper proposes a new local energy market design for distribution systems, which integrates peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and probabilistic locational marginal pricing. Distribution locational marginal pricing and P2P energy trading have each been proposed as potential alternatives to traditional retail pricing, to improve coordination between prosumers with distributed energy resources. Unidirectional locational pricing provides a scalable approach for coordinating demand, considering constraints and losses; while P2P energy trading allows prosumers to negotiate mutually beneficial bilateral energy transactions that increase the utilisation of their flexible energy resources. This paper proposes a market design combining the benefits of these two strategies. First, a new strategy for day-ahead locational marginal pricing is developed, which manages the uncertainty associated with local generation, demand and upstream prices by introducing a spread between the prices charged for energy imports and paid for energy exports. Then, local P2P energy trading platforms are integrated to additionally enable direct prosumer-to-prosumer trading, with transaction fees penalising energy transfers according to probabilistic differential locational marginal prices.

However, comparative insights on consumer responses to both these prices have not received attention. This paper attempts to fill this void by developing a system-wide demand response model to better understand price elasticities under DAM and RTM pricing. These insights may also assist grid operators to develop improved short-term forecasts of electricity demand. Using a large dataset from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and a hierarchical Bayesian population model, we offer new insights on how DAM and RTM pricing shapes demand for electricity, and the related consequences for maintaining a reliable electricity market. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian inference; Electricity demand; Energy forecast; Price effects,Bayesian networks; Commerce; Costs; Electric power utilization; Inference engines; Large dataset; Bayesian inference; Electric reliability council of texas; Electricity demands; Energy forecasts; Hierarchical bayesian; Price effect; Short-term forecasts; Wholesale electricity; Power markets; Bayesian analysis; demand analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy market; price dynamics; Texas; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kaplun V., Osypenko V.",About Using Electricity Pricing for Smart Grid Dynamic Management with Renewable Sources,2019,2.0,"A new approach to the design subsets (clusters) of 'objects' for optimal pricing in local systems of Smart Grid (SG) of the combined type has been proposed. In our case, under term 'objects' we understand the day-time (more precisely, twenty-four hours) periods, in which the necessary measurements of informative, from the standpoint of the task, values (the energy generated by the components of the system, its current cost for each type of generator, etc.) were performed. We assume that systems Smart Grid are based on renewable generation sources such as solar radiation and wind energy in combination with such system components as high-power storage batteries and power generators based on autonomous power station. The obtained statistical information formed the basis of constructing models that describe certain optimal in terms of developed criteria of a subset of 'objects' using bi-clustering algorithms. The authors of this innovative approach have in mind the further application of the model output (optimal clustering) for the dynamic estimation of the total cost of energy generated by its own components, taking into account the cost of the network involved in the subsequent periods of the day. In research the half-hourly sampling time within one day was used. Simulation on the basis of collected statistical data, the results of which can be applied in processes (algorithms) of electricity pricing for smart grid dynamic management with renewable sources has been performed. © 2019 IEEE.",dynamic energy management; electricity pricing; renewable sources; Smart Grid,Clustering algorithms; Costs; Digital storage; Electric generators; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power transmission networks; Power markets; Statistics; Wind power; Constructing models; Dynamic energy managements; Electricity pricing; Innovative approaches; Renewable generation; Renewable sources; Smart grid; Statistical information; Smart power grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aineto D., Iranzo-Sánchez J., Lemus-Zúñiga L.G., Onaindia E., Urchueguía J.F.",On the influence of renewable energy sources in electricity price forecasting in the Iberian market,2019,2.0,"The mainstream of EU policies is heading towards the conversion of the nowadays electricity consumer into the future electricity prosumer (producer and consumer) in markets in which the production of electricity will be more local, renewable and economically efficient. One key component of a local short-term and medium-term planning tool to enable actors to efficiently interact in the electric pool markets is the ability to predict and decide on forecast prices. Given the progressively more important role of renewable production in local markets, we analyze the influence of renewable energy production on the electricity price in the Iberian market through historical records. The dependencies discovered in this analysis will serve to identify the forecasts to use as explanatory variables for an electricity price forecasting model based on recurrent neural networks. The results will show the wide impact of using forecasted renewable energy production in the price forecasting. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

"Kim J.-H., Kim H.-J., Yoo S.-H.",Willingness to pay price premium for smartphones produced using renewable energy,2019,2.0,"Due to air pollution and greenhouse gases issues associated with the use of fossil fuels and nuclear safety issues after the Fukushima accident, consumers are increasingly in favor of commodities produced using electricity generated from relatively expensive renewable energy (RE) rather than cheap fossil fuels or nuclear energy. This is usually called 'RE100'. The objective of this study is to examine South Korean consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) price premium for a RE100 commodity using the specific case of smartphones. We accomplished the purpose by conducting a contingent valuation survey of 1000 individuals in August 2018 and analyzing the data gathered from the survey. In addition, the spike model was applied to dealing with the zero WTP responses. Based on the analysis results, an average price premium was statistically significantly estimated to be KRW 11,699 (USD 10.5) for all respondents. This is worth 1.6% of the price for a conventional non-RE100 smartphone (KRW 750,000 or USD 673.9) and is higher than the cost increase (0.97%) when producing RE100 smartphones. Therefore, it can be seen that South Korean consumers have sufficient acceptance for RE100 smartphones. © 2019 by the authors.",Consumer preference; Contingent valuation; Price premium; Renewable energy; Smartphone,alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; consumption behavior; contingent valuation; electricity generation; energy market; greenhouse gas; mobile phone; nuclear accident; preference behavior; willingness to pay; South Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Huang S.-C., Wu C.-F.",Energy commodity price forecasting with deep multiple kernel learning,2018,2.0,"Oil is an important energy commodity. The difficulties of forecasting oil prices stem from the nonlinearity and non-stationarity of their dynamics. However, the oil prices are closely correlated with global financial markets and economic conditions, which provides us with sufficient information to predict them. Traditional models are linear and parametric, and are not very effective in predicting oil prices. To address these problems, this study developed a new strategy. Deep (or hierarchical) multiple kernel learning (DMKL) was used to predict the oil price time series. Traditional methods from statistics and machine learning usually involve shallow models; however, they are unable to fully represent complex, compositional, and hierarchical data features. This explains why traditional methods fail to track oil price dynamics. This study aimed to solve this problem by combining deep learning and multiple kernel machines using information from oil, gold, and currency markets. DMKL is good at exploiting multiple information sources. It can effectively identify the relevant information and simultaneously select an apposite data representation. The kernels of DMKL were embedded in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is a deep model and efficient at representing complex and compositional data features. This provided a solid foundation for extracting the key features of oil price dynamics. By using real data for empirical testing, our new system robustly outperformed traditional models and significantly reduced the forecasting errors. © 2018 by the authors.

"Brix A.F., Lunde A., Wei W.",A generalized Schwartz model for energy spot prices — Estimation using a particle MCMC method,2018,2.0,"We investigate a large set of energy models that account for the stylized properties in energy prices, especially stochastic volatility and spikes. The models under consideration belong to the class of factor models while our full model features a two-factor price process and a two-component stochastic volatility process. The first factor in the price process captures the normal variations; the second accounts for spikes. The two-component volatility allows for a flexible autocorrelation structure. Instead of using various filtering techniques for splitting the factors, as often found in the literature, we estimate the model in one step using the particle MCMC method. We fit the models to both the spot market and the forward market for UK natural gas. We find that the inclusion of stochastic volatility is crucial for the statistical fit of spot prices whereas the spikes are important for explaining forward prices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Energy prices; Forward prices; Multi-factor model; Spikes; Stochastic volatility,Commerce; Costs; Stochastic systems; Energy prices; Forward price; Multi factors; Spikes; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic models; autocorrelation; energy market; natural gas; numerical model; price determination; stochasticity; United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Minhas D.M., Khalid R.R., Frey G.",Activation of electrical loads under electricity price uncertainty,2017,2.0,"The electricity price is an uncertain and changeable entity, mostly depends on power generating source and consumer's power demands behavior. The problem arises when all the consumers try to avail specific low price time slot to activate their power demands. It ends up with energy congestion or system destabilization. A better strategy is, to forecast a day ahead price and update it instantly, whenever a new consumer purchases an amount of energy for its next day demands. Therefore, every time a new price is applicable for the upcoming purchasers on day-ahead basis. This strategy may be adopted by an aggregator. An aggregator, which is equipped with renewable energy resources (RES), also imports electricity from the grid. It forecasts and updates a day-ahead fluctuating electricity price for its consumers. So that, all the consumers can avail relatively low price electricity slots based on their energy purchasing decisions. In this paper, a regression base statistical model is adopted to investigate two major problems: 1) accurate forecasting of day-ahead electricity price by an aggregator; 2) activate load demands by the consumers at lower electricity prices. In our proposed solution, linear regression is used to forecast the electricity price, exploiting intermittent nature of the renewables. Whereas, load activation strategy is proposed by introducing electrical loads with different levels of delay tolerance. Applying boundary condition values using logistic regression, a consumer can activate its loads on different electricity prices. The simulation results have established an effectively forecasted value of electricity price and an accurate activation of consumer's load demands. © 2017 IEEE.",demand response; load management; price forecasting; regression models,Chemical activation; Consumer behavior; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Electric load management; Electric power utilization; Energy resources; Forecasting; Purchasing; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Demand response; Electricity prices; Logistic regressions; Price forecasting; Purchasing decisions; Regression model; Renewable energy resource (RES); Statistical modeling; Power markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vijayalakshmi S., Girish G.P., Singhania K., Vincent E.N.",Is Indian Spot Electricity Price Series Stationary?,2017,2.0,"Day-ahead spot electricity market of Indian energy exchange operates all 24 hours, 365 days a year. Many studies in literature have explored modeling spot electricity prices particularly in the context of NordPool, CalPx and PJM markets but very few studies in literature have explored modeling spot electricity prices in Indian context. Is Indian Spot Electricity Price Series Stationary? Answering this fundamental question paves way for application of techniques inspired from time series econometric modeling and forecasting literature which makes an inherent assumption that the underlying price-series is stationary. In this study we empirically investigate whether Spot Electricity Price Series is Stationary by using 17,520 hourly spot prices for each of the five regions of Indian electricity market and applying Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test, Phillips Peron Test, Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin Test and Narayan and Popp Test allowing for structural breaks.

"Asan G., Tasaltin K.",Market efficiency assessment under dual pricing rule for the Turkish wholesale electricity market,2017,2.0,"This study analyses the price dynamics of day-ahead and real-time electricity prices following the implementation of dual-pricing legislation in Turkey, to understand the legislation's impact on arbitrage opportunities and market efficiency. The convergence of prices between the day-ahead forward and the real-time markets analysed in order to determine whether persistent price differences between the two markets exist. Arbitrage opportunities exist if there is a persistent difference between prices in the day-ahead forward and real-time market. Markets are considered to be efficient if it is not possible for market participants to earn an excess profit through exploitation of price differences. Furthermore, we examined how the ex-post risk premium changes over time using rolling estimations and find that after the implementation of dual pricing, the risk premium increased significantly for day and peak hours where the demand is relatively higher compared to night hours. As market participants have more experience regarding the dynamics of the market, the difference between real-time and day-ahead forward prices converges to zero since the dual-pricing regime enforce market participants to forecast accurately by punishing the forecast error. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity; Market efficiency; Market structure,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Efficiency; Electricity; Risk perception; Arbitrage opportunity; Convergence of prices; Electricity prices; Market efficiency; Market participants; Market structures; Rolling estimations; Wholesale electricity markets; Power markets; efficiency measurement; electricity supply; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; policy implementation; pricing policy; real time; Turkey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Khoussi S., Bilil H., Aniba G.",Optimal time of use of renewable electricity pricing: Three-player games model,2016,2.0,"Currently, the electricity demand is exponentially increasing due to the population growth. Therefore, the demand side management (DSM) is becoming unavoidable especially with the increasing use of renewable energy sources. One of the most known tactics of DSM is the use pricing strategies to threaten users to schedule their loads by controlling their own appliances. In this paper, a new model of electricity market operators is proposed based on three actors: The utility grid (G) with renewable energy (RE) generation, the electricity consumer (U) and a storage company (S). This approach aims to develop the adequate hourly prices which optimize the utility function of each operator. Then, in order to deal with this objective, two related games are defined. The first one is based on the satisfaction function of U and the G and aims to give the hourly prices of consumers' electricity bills. While the second one is based on the satisfaction function of G and S in order to optimize the hourly prices of G's electricity bills. Finally, a case study based on a given RE production and consumers load forecasts has been considered. Simulation results show that the obtained hourly prices allows the consumer load curve to follow the RE curve generation while achieving the main objective of the proposed approach. © 2015 IEEE.",game theory three players; optimization; outsourced storage; Renewable Energy based generation,Costs; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Game theory; Optimization; Population statistics; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Electricity consumers; Electricity demands; Model of electricity market; Population growth; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Satisfaction functions; Use of renewable energies; Electric power transmission networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Gharesifard B., Basar T., Domínguez-García A.D.",Designing pricing strategies for coordination of networked distributed energy resources,2014,2.0,"We study the problem of aggregator's mechanism design for controlling the amount of active, or reactive, power provided, or consumed, by a group of distributed energy resources (DERs). The aggregator interacts with the wholesale electricity market and through some market-clearing mechanism is incentivized to provide (or consume) a certain amount of active (or reactive) power over some period of time, for which it will be compensated. The objective is for the aggregator to design a pricing strategy for incentivizing DERs to modify their active (or reactive) power consumptions (or productions) so that they collectively provide the amount that the aggregator has agreed to provide. The aggregator and DERs' strategic decision-making process can be cast as a Stackelberg game, in which aggregator acts as the leader and the DERs are the followers. In previous work [Gharesifard et al., 2013b, a], we have introduced a framework in which each DER uses the pricing information provided by the aggregator and some estimate of the average energy that neighboring DERs can provide to compute a Nash equilibrium solution in a distributed manner. Here, we focus on the interplay between the aggregator's decision-making process and the DERs' decision-making process. In particular, we propose a simple feedback-based privacy-preserving pricing control strategy that allows the aggregator to coordinate the DERs so that they collectively provide the amount of active (or reactive) power agreed upon, provided that there is enough capacity available among the DERs. We provide a formal analysis of the stability of the resulting closed-loop system. We also discuss the shortcomings of the proposed pricing strategy, and propose some avenues of future work. We illustrate the proposed strategy via numerical simulations. © IFAC.",Distributed control; Distributed energy resources; Energy market; Game theory; Power systems,Automation; Closed loop systems; Commerce; Costs; Data privacy; Distributed parameter control systems; Energy resources; Game theory; Machine design; Power markets; Standby power systems; Decision making process; Distributed control; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy markets; Market clearing mechanisms; Privacy preserving; Strategic decision making; Wholesale electricity markets; Decision making,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Egger P.H., Kesina M., Nigai S.",Contagious Energy Prices,2013,2.0,"We develop an empirical model of the determinants of end-use energy prices in 28 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. For this, we construct a unique panel data-set and formulate a spatial panel econometric model with fixed country effects for the period of 1980-2009. A special feature of the proposed empirical model is that cross-country interdependence in energy prices surfaces through two channels, a metric of similarity towards energy policy and a metric of trade in energy goods. We estimate the parameters of that model and conduct several comparative static experiments. We find that higher income per capita and lower efficiency in energy distribution tend to raise energy prices whereas higher net imports of energy and more abundant energy resource endowments reduce them. We also find that bilateral trade in energy goods is an important channel of transmission of shocks in energy prices across countries. The estimation results suggest that countries that use the same types of resources to generate energy are likely to transmit energy price shocks to each other through competition effects. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,competition (economics); data set; econometrics; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; energy resource; import; numerical model; OECD; panel data; price dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete information on the factors which can be used for estimating cost function is not definite and also is not accessible. The importance of cost function estimation is appeared when the Independent System Operator (ISO) decide to measure the market power which can be exerted by a market participant.

In this market, firm's cost function is recovered by optimizing behavior for each firm. After defining the profit of the firm and using the first order conditions for expected profit maximization, the generalized method of moment (GMM) is used for estimating cost function. In estimation procedure, the firm's cost function is obtained by using the weighted average prices, for computing the total revenue of each firm and the maximum accepted price, instead of market clearing price. © 2008 IEEE.",Cost function estimation; Electricity markets; Pay-as-bib auction; Weighted average price,Commerce; Cost functions; Economics; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric utilities; Marketing; Maximum likelihood estimation; Method of moments; Competitive electricity markets; Complete informations; Cost function estimation; Electricity markets; Estimation procedures; Expected profits; First-order conditions; Generalized method of moments; Independent system operators; Market clearing prices; Market participants; Market power; Pay as bids; Pay-as-bib auction; Pay-as-bid auctions; Power markets; Pricing rules; Total revenues; Uniform pricing; Weighted average price; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first case illustrates the case of ex-ante LMPs in the Day Ahead timeframe and in the Real-Time timeframe. In this case the calculations are based on the results of the day ahead market clearing and the real time market clearing. The second case illustrates the case of ex-post LMPs, in which the calculations are based on the results of the solved State Estimator. The practical problems encountered and solved as part of the implementation of these two systems, are reviewed. Key concerns are the quality of the network model, redundancy of data, and modeling of the market rules which identifying special cases and which identify the marginal units which are allowed to set the LMPs.

Ilic M.,On the objectives of transmission pricing under open access,1999,2.0,"In the new competitive market for power, generators try to maximize their profit independently. The existence of a single price for power, result of the interaction of supply and demand, ensures that during each period, the forecasted generation output balances with the expected load. Transmission prices, considered as coordinate variables within a two level optimization scheme, can perform this task and ensure that the system remains together in the short-run and operates at minimum cost. Under the assumption of perfect market conditions and assuming the markets are always at the equilibrium, all these transmission pricing schemes lead to the same dispatch of generation resources.",,Competition; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Electric industry; Electric load dispatching; Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission; Electric rates; Industrial economics; Marketing; Optimization; Transmission pricing methods; Electric power systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pierro M., Moser D., Perez R., Cornaro C.",The value of PV power forecast and the paradox of the “single pricing” scheme: The Italian case study,2020,1.0,"One of the major problem of photovoltaic grid integration is limiting the solar-induced imbalances since these can undermine the security and stability of the electrical system. Improving the forecast accuracy of photovoltaic generation is becoming essential to allow a massive solar penetration. In particular, improving the forecast accuracy of large solar farms’ generation is important both for the producers/traders to minimize the imbalance costs and for the transmission system operators to ensure stability. In this article, we provide a benchmark for the day-ahead forecast accuracy of utility scale photovoltaic (PV) plants in 1325 locations spanning the country of Italy. We then use these benchmarked forecasts and real energy prices to compute the economic value of the forecast accuracy and accuracy improvement in the context of the Italian energy market’s regulatory framework. Through this study, we further point out several important criticisms of the Italian “single pricing” system that brings paradoxical and counterproductive effects regarding the need to reduce the imbalance volumes. Finally, we propose a new market-pricing rule and innovative actions to overcome the undesired effects of the current dispatching regulations. © 2020 by the authors.

"Sánchez de la Nieta A.A., Contreras J.",Quantifying the effect of renewable generation on day–ahead electricity market prices: The Spanish case,2020,1.0,"The penetration of renewable generation has grown since the electricity sector has been deregulated. To account for that, this paper proposes a methodology to estimate the downward effect of renewable generation participation upon the day-ahead electricity market prices, since such an effect is quite intuitive observing the merit order of the generating units. The European Electricity Market Matching Algorithm (EMMA) is currently based on Euphemia (Price Coupling of Regions), though there are several differences among countries across Europe. The new algorithm proposed uses market orders, which include aggregate hourly orders such as aggregate supply and demand curves. These orders are simple orders and the marginal price is affected by complex orders, especially by the minimum income condition (MIC) used in the Iberian Electricity Market and considered in our proposed algorithm. A case study of the Spanish day-ahead electricity market is evaluated for 2015, for which a daily generation sample is composed of 16 days in 2015. The sample is created following the characteristics of thermal production, renewable production and inframarginal production. The conclusions are drawn comparing the simulations of the real marginal prices and the new marginal prices after incorporating renewable generation participation into the aggregate demand curve at the maximum price. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Day-ahead electricity market; Merit order; Renewable energy,Aggregates; Costs; Electric industry; Aggregate demands; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity sector; Generating unit; Iberian electricity market; Matching algorithm; Renewable generation; Supply and demand; Power markets; algorithm; alternative energy; demand analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; price dynamics; quantitative analysis; Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Liu D., Li C., Zhao D., Wang Q.",Research on the joint fluctuation laws between locational marginal price and renewables based on complex networks: A case study in Independent System Operator New England,2019,1.0,"The growing share of renewable energy has an increasingly significant impact on the electricity market. Locational marginal price (LMP), as a sensitive price signal, has a potential but considerable correlation with renewable energy generation. In this context, this paper focuses on the joint fluctuation laws between LMP and renewables consumed to generate electricity. At first, LMP and renewables consumption data from Independent System Operator New England (ISO-NE) are collected and preprocessed. Then, through highly comparative time-series analysis (hctsa), it is found that discrete symbolization features have effective description ability. Therefore, a coarse-grained method is conducted to convert the real matrix data into a symbol vector based on numerical distribution analysis. Next, joint fluctuation complex networks are constructed according to the symbol vector. From a global perspective, the joint fluctuation network follows an exponential distribution and exhibits hierarchical modularity. From a local perspective, the joint fluctuation network follows a power-law distribution. The research results of this paper provide a new perspective to understand the evolution of the electricity market with large-scale renewable energy and have reference value for identifying the valuable joint fluctuation patterns and improving the LMP forecast results. © 2019 The Authors.

Fabre A.,Evolution of EROIs of electricity until 2050: Estimation and implications on prices,2019,1.0,"The EROI – for Energy Returned On Invested – of an energy technology measures its ability to provide energy efficiently. Previous studies draw a link between the affluence of a society and the EROI of its energy system, and show that EROIs of renewables are lower than those of fossil fuels. Logically, concerns have been expressed that system-wide EROI may decrease during a renewable energy transition. First, I explain theoretically that the EROIs of renewables themselves could then decrease as energy-efficient fossil fuels would be replaced by less energy-efficient renewables in the supply-chain. Then, using the multi-regional input-output model THEMIS, I estimate the evolution of EROIs and prices of electric technologies from 2010 to 2050 for different scenarios. Global EROI of electricity is predicted to go from 12 in 2010 to 11 in 2050 in a business-as-usual scenario, but down to 6 in a 100% renewable one. Finally, I study the economic implication of a declining EROI. An inverse relation between EROI and price is suggested empirically, even though theory shows that both quantities may move in the same direction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Energy transition; EROI; Input-output; MRIO; Sustainability; THEMIS,alternative energy; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy market; estimation method; fossil fuel; input-output analysis; price dynamics; scenario analysis; supply chain management; sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dumas J., Boukas I., De Villena M.M., Mathieu S., Cornelusse B.",Probabilistic Forecasting of Imbalance Prices in the Belgian Context,2019,1.0,"Forecasting imbalance prices is essential for strategic participation in the short-Term energy markets. A novel two-step probabilistic approach is proposed, with a particular focus on the Belgian case. The first step consists in computing the net regulation volume state transition probabilities. It is modeled as a matrix computed using historical data. This matrix is then used to infer the imbalance prices, since the net regulation volume can be related to the level of reserves activated and the corresponding marginal prices for each activation level are published by the Belgian Transmission System Operator one day before electricity delivery.

"Qin Q., Xie K., He H., Li L., Chu X., Wei Y.-M., Wu T.",An effective and robust decomposition-ensemble energy price forecasting paradigm with local linear prediction,2019,1.0,"Energy price time series exhibit nonlinear and nonstationary features, which make accurate forecasting energy prices challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition-ensemble forecasting paradigm based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and local linear prediction (LLP). The EEMD is used to decompose energy price time series into components, including several intrinsic mode functions and one residual with a simplified structure. Motivated by the findings of the fully local characteristics of a time series decomposed by the EEMD, we adopt the LLP technique to forecast each component. The forecasting results of all the components are aggregated as a final forecast. For validation, three types of energy price time series, crude oil, electricity and natural gas prices, are studied. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves an improvement in terms of both level forecasting and direction forecasting. The performance of the proposed model is also validated through comparison with several energy price forecasting approaches from the literature. In addition, the robustness and the effects of the parameter settings of LLP are investigated. We conclude the proposed model is easy to implement and efficient for energy price forecasting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Energy price; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Forecasting; Local linear prediction,Costs; Natural gas; Signal processing; Time series; Energy prices; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decompositions (EEMD); Ensemble forecasting; Intrinsic Mode functions; Local characteristics; Local linear predictions; Natural gas price; Forecasting; decomposition analysis; empirical analysis; energy market; ensemble forecasting; prediction; price determination; time series analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Baek M., Ashuri B.",Analysis of the Variability of Submitted Unit Price Bids for Asphalt Line Items in Highway Projects,2019,1.0,"Highway construction costs are subject to significant variations from project to project and over time. Variations in construction cost disrupt transportation agencies in making right investment decisions and estimating accurate construction costs for projects. A wide range of variables has been proposed in different studies to explain variations in construction cost. There is value in conducting a research study that attempts to consider a comprehensive list of variables with potentials to explain the variations. The study needs to simultaneously take into account all possible explanatory variables to examine their relations with construction costs. The objective of this research is to assess the relations of several potential variables to explain variations in submitted unit price bids for major asphalt line items in highway projects. The primary contribution of this paper to the body of knowledge is the creation of a random parameters model to explain variations in submitted unit price bids for asphalt line items in highway projects. The identified variables used to build the random parameters model were classified into two major tiers. Tier 1 represents project-specific categories, including project characteristics, major supply sources for critical materials, and price adjustment clauses. Tier 2 represents global and external categories, consisting of the level of activities in local highway construction market, construction market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, and energy market conditions. It is expected that the findings of this paper will contribute to the current practice of cost estimation and investment decision making by helping transportation agencies develop more accurate budgets and contractors prepare more accurate bids for highway projects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Asphalt; Budget control; Commerce; Decision making; Highway planning; Investments; Road construction; Construction markets; Explanatory variables; Highway construction; Highway construction costs; Investment decision making; Investment decisions; Project characteristics; Transportation agencies; Cost estimating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zarnikau J., Woo C.K., Zhu S., Baldick R., Tsai C.H., Meng J.",Electricity market prices for day-ahead ancillary services and energy: Texas,2019,1.0,"Applying a regression-based approach to a large sample of hourly observations for the seven-year period of January 1, 2011 to December 30, 2017, we explore determinants of day-ahead market (DAM) prices for ancillary services (ASs) and energy in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). For each GW increase in responsive reserve (RRS) or nonspinning reserve (NSRS) procurement quantities, we estimate price increases of about US$3.47 per MW per hour and US$5.63 per MW per hour, respectively; while the cost of an additional 1 GW of regulation up (REGUP) and regulation down (REGDN) is a much higher US$17 perMWper hour and US$31 per MW per hour, respectively. A US$1/MWh increase in the DAM energy pricetends to increase RRS and REGUP prices by nearly US$1 per MW per hour, about twice the estimated impact for NSRS that is not necessarily online when selected. The participation of interruptible loads to provide RRSs reduces the RRS price, and this effect increased nearly six-fold from the first to the second half of our sample time period. An increase in wind generation tends to decrease AS prices because it reduces the DAM energy price via the merit-order effect. Hence, Texas’s wind generation expansion has not raised ERCOT’s AS prices in our sample period, which is characterized by a stable AS requirement and declining natural gas prices. Going forward, however, Texas could face AS cost escalation due to the high REGUP and REGDN prices, should ERCOT’s requirement and procurement of those services increase due to rising renewable production. © 2019 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.",Ancillary services (ASS); Day-ahead market (DAM); Electric reliability council of texas (ERCOT); Electricity prices; Texas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Teixeira J.P., Saraiva J.T.",Behavior of the Iberian electricity market prices in 2016 considering increasing values of feed-in generation,2018,1.0,"This paper results from the research conducted by the first author during the preparation of his MSc Thesis. This research aimed at investigating the impact on the market prices of the Iberian Electricity Market, MIBEL, due to increases of the feed-in generation, as such an increase is expected to occur in the next few years, namely for PV systems. This research was conducted using real market data publicly available in the web site of the Iberian Market Operator for 2016. To estimate this impact, for each trading hour of 2016 we considered new segments at price 0,0 /MWh to translate the priority given to this type of generation. These segments representing the new feed-in generation were then used together with the selling bids submitted by market agents to build the new aggregated selling curve. The new market price was finally obtained as the intersection of the new selling curve with the original buying curve, that was assumed unchanged. The global result indicates that if the feed-in generation increases by 25% regarding the values of 2016, then the average annual market price decreases by 6,57 % regarding the original value of 39,42 /MWh. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity market; Feed-in generation; Iberian Electricity Market; Impacts; Prices,Costs; Electric industry; Power markets; Sales; Iberian electricity market; Iberian market; Impacts; Market agents; Market price; Prices; PV system; Real markets; Commerce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Chanda C.K., Pal J., Paul B., Pathak M.K.",On transmission congestion management strategies and forecasting locational marginal prices in a deregulated competitive power market,2018,1.0,"To maximize both the social benefits of the customers and the efficiency of the transmission network system, the constraints of the transmission networks and the security level of the power system must be essentially controlled. In a competitive power market, congestion problem becomes an obstacle since it directly influences nodal pricing at various buses in the system. To keep a flat price profile at every node, dispatching of generating units and also load curtailment in a system may be required. Different pricing at every node or LMPs (Locational Marginal Price) are due to congestion of the network. The LMP at any node is the total cost of the incremental outputs of the marginal generators to deliver one unit of energy at that node without increasing the flow of the congested line. This paper presents a novel method to minimize total cost in respect of flow tariff, load costs, generator bids, zero congestion surplus and choosing properly the reference bus in a highly congested power system network. An improved LMP has been defined in this context which takes into account all of the above factors. The LMPs are calculated by incorporating Shift Factor (SF) based DC-Optimal power flow (DC-OPF) model. The proposed method has been applied in a four bus network and the results obtained have been found to be capable of eradicating the local market power monopoly in a system. © 2017 IEEE.",Congestion; Congestion-surplus; DC-OPF; LMP; Shift Factor,Buses; Commerce; Deregulation; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Power markets; Traffic congestion; Competitive power markets; Congestion; Congestion-surplus; DC-OPF; Locational marginal prices; Power system networks; Shift factors; Transmission congestion management; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Bertrand G., Papavasiliou A.",Optimal dispatch of wind farms facing market prices,2017,1.0,"At present, wind power producers (WPP) are paid following feed-in tariffs in Belgium. This system will come to an end soon due to its high cost and the producers will have to bid in the day-ahead market. As wind owners cannot forecast their production perfectly, they will face imbalance costs or revenues. Imbalance price forecasting is therefore a critical problem. In this paper, we implement a machine learning model to assess the usefulness of introducing exogenous variables in imbalance price forecasting. This method shows improved results compared to classical methods. Since the imbalance price is obtained by the marginal cost of producing the missing energy, the strategic behaviour of a WPP will influence the imbalance price. In this paper, we propose a way to represent this influence as well as a formulation of a model to obtain the optimal bidding strategy in that situation.

"Ding M., Wang X., Wang J., Yang Z., Zhong H., Yang J.",A dynamic period partition method for time-of-use pricing with high-penetration renewable energy,2017,1.0,"Time-of-use (TOU) pricing has become an effective measure to incentivize demand response (DR) resources to interact with power grids and facilitate the accommodation of renewable energy. In this paper, a TOU pricing method is proposed considering dynamic time period partition. Distinguished from the conventional TOU prices fixed for a long term, the proposed time period partition is updated every day due to the volatility of high-penetration renewable energy, and determined based on the day-ahead system net load forecast. For practical implementation with minimal policy adjustment, the levels of TOU prices remain unchanged, and the daily time periods are categorized into three clusters using the Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm, i.e., peak, intermediate and valley periods. Then a day-ahead economic dispatch model considering DR is formulated to evaluate the impacts of the proposed TOU prices on the accommodation of renewable energy. Case studies based on a provincial power grid illustrates that the proposed method can determine the time period partition of TOU prices according to the system net load forecast, and effectively encourage DR resources to interact with power grids and improve renewable energy accommodation. © 2017 IEEE.",clustering; demand response; renewable energy; time period partition; time-of-use pricing,Clustering algorithms; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Fuzzy clustering; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; clustering; Demand response; Renewable energies; Time period partitions; Time-of-use pricing; Electric load dispatching,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We implement an econometric approach using data from the Interconnection-France-Angleterre (IFA); such an approach controls for factors that may influence prices besides the ETM. The modelling indicates that the target model raised day-ahead capacity prices for the direction FR→GB by €7.45 to €8.07/MWh. Results for the GB→FR direction are sensitive to the model used, but range from €0.475/MWh to €10.65/MWh, with the higher value coming from a censored regression model. Using the model's prediction, adding capacity of 1000MW would roughly reduce prices by €6. Gas price differentials account for about €1 of the interconnection price. The overall indication is that the ETM has achieved some of its initial goals in allowing interconnection prices to rise and more fully reflect congestion rents and the need for investment. Our work should be taken as preliminary, as many factors, such as long-term contracts, may further influence conclusions. © 2016 IEEE.",econometrics; power system economics; power system interconnection,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Electric power system interconnection; Investments; Regression analysis; Statistics; Approach controls; Censored regression; econometrics; Electricity interconnections; Interconnection capacity; Long-term contracts; Power system economics; Power system interconnection; Power markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We confirm the hypothesis that we can use supply curves as a characteristic of day or hour to define groups of hours with similar price dependency on consumption level. Proposed a method allows two times more accurately predict the price depending on consumption, based on the splitting all the days and hours into compact groups. After all we show how this technique can help with detection of outliers. © 2015 The Authors.

The characteristics of generators and price uncertainty need to be considered while formulating bidding strategies as they have a direct impact on expected profit. The rapid development of wind technology leads to an increasing share of wind power in the market and should be considered for calculating the Market Clearing Price (MCP). In this paper, the effects of wind intermittency on MCP variations of the wind farm generators are considered for the price based unit commitment strategy of the Genco.

"Cochran S.J., Mansur I., Odusami B.",Equity market implied volatility and energy prices: A double threshold GARCH approach,2015,1.0,"This study investigates the role of VIX in determining the returns and return volatilities of oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas. A double threshold GARCH(1,1) methodology is utilized where the VIX index is used as the threshold regime change indicator. Daily data from January 4, 1999, to December 31, 2013, are used. A sub-period analysis covering only the financial crisis period of January 2, 2007, to December 31, 2009, is also performed. This study provides evidence that the level of equity market volatility (i.e., VIX) that triggers a regime shift is commodity specific. The results also indicate that the threshold VIX values are time varying. Furthermore, natural gas prices appear to withstand considerably more volatility in the equity market than do the prices of other energy commodities. This relationship is even more pronounced during the financial crisis period. Approximately 70% and 50% of the estimated coefficients display asymmetric sensitivities due to regime changes during the entire period and the crisis period, respectively. The findings have practical implications as the underlying volatility of an asset plays a significant role in determining its associated activity in the futures markets. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Double threshold GARCH; Energy prices; G12; Q40; VIX,Commerce; Costs; Natural gas; Double threshold GARCH; Energy prices; G12; Q40; VIX; Financial markets; commodity price; energy market; financial crisis; index method; methodology; natural gas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Velasco J.M., Gonzalez-Perez B., Minana G., Lopez V., Caro R.",An explanatory analysis of electricity prices within day-ahead Spanish energy market by using a graphical automatization with R,2014,1.0,"Since 1998, the Spanish and Portuguese Administrations began to share a common path in building the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). This cooperation has been very successful, not only for its contribution to the existence of an electricity market on an Iberian level, but also on a European scale, as a significant step in building the Internal Energy Market. The price of electricity in the MIBEL is very changeable. This creates a lot of uncertainty and risk in market actors. Due to continuous changes in demand and marginal price adjustment, buyers and sellers can not know in advance the evolution of prices. Our interest is to study of this uncertainty since the perspective of the buyer and not the seller's perspective. The aim of this work is to develop a graphical analysis of the variables involved in the Spanish Energy Market in order to explain the electric price and provide to small traders, that could be interested in participating in that market, better knowledge of the schedule. On the other hand, large industrial consumers use this information to design strategies to optimize its production capacity and improve their production costs. In this article the variable of interest is the marginal price instead of demand. This paper provides a graphical analysis by means of an easily reproducible automatization with the R project for statistical computing that allows to explore, visualize and understand the key variables that define its final value.

"Mardani H., Souri D.",Estimation of marginal cost function using bid price and quantity to power market,2008,1.0,"A major challenge for designers of competitive electricity markets is to devise market rules that limit the capability of electricity producers to exercise market power. Market power is the ability of a firm owning generation assets to raise the market price by its bidding behavior and to profit from this price increase. In addition, an important plan of market monitoring units in long term and competition policy framework is to persuade the participants to bid prices near to their marginal costs. Therefore, estimation of marginal cost function is important in way that Regulatory use it to increase competition in electricity markets. Bid price of the power plant to the power market contains some important information that can lead to more exact estimation of their marginal cost.

Power intrachange means that a power system can purchase the extra surplus electricity from cogeneration systems and Independent Power Producers which belong inside or outside the region when there is an imbalance problem in the regional power supply and demand. In addition, the economic dispatch principle is used to estimate the market value of power intrachange. Furthermore, the reasonable purchase price of power intrachange among the seven time-segments of the Taiwan power system is the energy rate of cogeneration units during each period plus half of the average purchase value of surplus electricity of cogeneration units.

Wu Z.Q.,Reliability transaction and pricing under power system deregulation,2008,1.0,"Under deregulation, different customers require different levels of reliability; different generator units have different reliability. How to price the reliability in electricity market is one of the most important tasks for power system reliability analysis. In this paper, relation between backup capacity and supply reliability is established based on load forecasting probability density function. The reliability charging rates for customer load with different reliability requirements are determined by using back up reserve cost. Under reliability market, load customers bid the reliability requirement and price to the power transaction center (PX) according to their own reliability demands and the published reliability costs. The reserve schedule is determined according to customer reliability requirements and back up reserve market price. The PX calculates the required added back up reserve capacity caused by generation unit outage, and further the reliability charging rates for generation unit is determined. Load point reliability can be maintained by controlling the load curtailment when system load is greater than the total capacity of scheduled generators and back up units in real time operation. The proposed method can be used to price the customer reliability and generator unit reliability. It can also be used to determine system back up capacity requirement.

"Mirbach T., Blaesig B., Baltes P., Haubrich H.-J.",A competitive market simulation method for the investigation of the price development in the European market for electrical energy,2008,1.0,"Due to the liberalization of the European electricity market, power generation companies are exposed to national and international competition. Therefore, the behavior of the companies, which originally minimized their power generation costs, has changed to an individual profit maximization. In addition, political conditions, e.g. the implementation of emission certificates, have introduced new uncertainties for power generation companies resulting in new properties of the market price for electrical energy. In consequence, the economic profitability of generation units is influenced. Therefore, investigations and forecasts of the price development in the European power market have to consider these new conditions. Market simulation methods, which simulate the market for electrical energy, allow to investigate the development of the market price. Considering these circumstances, this paper presents a competitive market simulation method for the investigation of the price development in the central European market for electrical energy.

"Piao L., de Vries L., de Weerdt M., Yorke-Smith N.",Electricity markets for DC distribution systems: Locational pricing trumps wholesale pricing,2021,,"DC distribution systems are a promising alternative to existing AC distribution systems. They connect customers to local energy sources without conversion, thus reducing power losses. However, the unique features of DC impose strict requirements for system operation compared to AC. Within the context of a liberalized energy market, this article demonstrates three promising market designs—an outcome of a comprehensive engineering design framework—that meet those DC requirements. They are an integrated market design, which incorporates all system costs into energy prices; a market design that passes wholesale energy prices directly to prosumers; and a locational energy market design that relieves congestion with nodal prices. An optimization model estimates the three market designs’ performance by simulating a realistic DC distribution system, featuring a high share of electric vehicles. Results indicate that the integrated market design is optimal in theory but computationally infeasible in practice. The wholesale energy price design aiming at constraint-free energy trading requires substantial investments in flexibility. The locational energy market design yields nearly optimal operation in urban networks and is considered the best feasible market design for DC distribution systems. © 2020 The Author(s)",Direct current; Distribution system; Electricity market design; Flexibility; Optimization,DC power transmission; Free energy; Investments; Location; Power markets; DC distribution system; Energy market designs; Engineering design; Liberalized energy markets; Locational pricing; Optimal operation; Optimization modeling; Substantial investments; Costs; electric vehicle; electricity industry; energy market; energy planning; feasibility study; optimization; price determination; price dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Brok N.B., Munk-Nielsen T., Madsen H., Stentoft P.A.",Unlocking energy flexibility of municipal wastewater aeration using predictive control to exploit price differences in power markets,2020,,"To accommodate the increasing amount of renewable energy sources in electricity grids it is crucial to utilize the flexibility of all electricity consumers. Municipal wastewater treatment plants consume approximately 1 % of the electricity consumption of a country's total electricity consumption, to reduce nutrient concentrations from the incoming wastewater before discharging the water back into the environment. In this paper, a novel economic optimal control strategy is proposed for unlocking the available energy flexibility in wastewater treatment. The strategy suggests that the power consumption in wastewater treatment can be flexible since the water is treated in large tanks with long retention times where specialized aeration equipment is repeatedly switched on and off. By controlling these switching times with respect to nutrient concentrations, electricity consumption can be predicted and shifted in time and hence provide short-term demand side flexibility. The proposed principle is used to reduce the operating costs of a wastewater treatment plant by enabling the flexibility to distribute the aeration load to periods with less expensive power prices. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated for the operation of a single wastewater treatment plant and the strategy is backtested on Nord Pool market data from 2019. This shows modest savings of 1.15% if only the day-ahead market is considered. However, if the regulating and special regulating power prices are included in the optimization the realized savings are in the magnitude of 7.23% and 27.32%, respectively. Thus this study is considered as a step towards exploiting flexibility for the benefit of reducing the combined taxation and aeration cost of wastewarer treatment. © 2020",Balancing market; Energy flexibility; Optimal control; Optimization; Price-based control; Smart energy application; Wastewater treatment,Cost reduction; Electric power utilization; Nutrients; Operating costs; Optimal control systems; Power markets; Reclamation; Renewable energy resources; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Taxation; Water aeration; Water treatment plants; Electricity consumers; Electricity-consumption; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Municipal wastewaters; Nutrient concentrations; Optimal control strategy; Renewable energy source; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; aeration; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy planning; municipal solid waste; optimization; power plant; prediction; wastewater treatment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the present study is an effort to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by recruiting political institutions and energy prices to examine financial development with the most comprehensive (IMF's index) in BRIC (Brazil, Russia, China, and India) in a framework of resource endowment theory. By using the maximum data available from 1992 to 2016, short- & long-run relationships are estimated through cross-section augmented autoregressive distributive lag model (CS-ARDL) along with a common correlated effect mean group (CCEMG). As per the results of the above-mentioned second-generation econometric techniques, political-institutional quality is positively effecting financial development, implying better quality of institutions is strengthening financial development. Whereas, energy prices are negatively effecting financial development. Moreover, the resources are found as a blessing for BRIC economies. Overall, BRIC economies need to control the prices of the energy sector to promote financial development in the future.

It challenges the conventional forecasting principles which argue that adaptive methods should place most emphasis upon recent data and that regime-switching should likewise model transitions from the latest regime. The approach in this paper recognises that the most relevant dataset in the episodic, recurrent nature of electricity dynamics may not be the most recent. This methodology provides a dynamic calibration dataset approach that is based on cluster analysis applied to fundamental market regime indicators, as well as structural time series breakpoint analyses. Forecasting is based upon applying a hybrid fundamental optimisation model with a neural network to the appropriate calibration data.

"Lucas A., Pegios K., Kotsakis E., Clarke D.",Price forecasting for the balancing energy market using machine-learning regression,2020,,"The importance of price forecasting has gained attention over the last few years, with the growth of aggregators and the general opening of the European electricity markets. Market participants manage a tradeoff between, bidding in a lower price market (day-ahead), but with typically higher volume, or aiming for a lower volume market but with potentially higher returns (balance energy market). Companies try to forecast the extremes of revenues or prices, in order to manage risk and opportunity, assigning their assets in an optimal way. It is thought that in general, electricity markets have quasi-deterministic principles, rather than being based on speculation, hence the desire to forecast the price based on variables that can describe the outcome of the market. Many studies address this problem from a statistical approach or by performing multiple-variable regressions, but they very often focus only on the time series analysis. In 2019, the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) was made available in the UK for the first time. Taking this opportunity, this study focusses on five LOLP variables (with different time-ahead estimations) and other quasi-deterministic variables, to explain the price behavior of a multi-variable regression model. These include base production, system load, solar and wind generation, seasonality, day-ahead price and imbalance volume contributions. Three machine-learning algorithms were applied to test for performance, Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost. XGBoost presented higher performance and so it was chosen for the implementation of the real time forecast step. The model returns a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.89 £/MWh, a coefficient of determination (R2 score) of 76.8% and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 124.74. The variables that contribute the most to the model are the Net Imbalance Volume, the LOLP (aggregated), the month and the De-rated margins (aggregated) with 28.6%, 27.5%, 14.0%, and 8.9% of weight on feature importance respectively. © 2020 by the authors.",Balance energy market; Demand response; Imbalance market; Loss of load probability; Machine learning; Price forecast,Adaptive boosting; Balancing; Decision trees; Fintech; Forecasting; Loss of load probability; Machine learning; Mean square error; Multivariable systems; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Gradient boosting; Loss of load probabilities (LOLP); Market participants; Mean absolute error; Mean squared error; Real-time forecasts; Risk and opportunity; Statistical approach; Power markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, we employ principal component analysis and generate Granger causality networks to examine the degree of interconnectedness of the NEM in a time-varying setting. We find that the derived measures of interdependence can be related to actual market events such as price spikes, unexpected high demand for electricity, sudden increases in price volatility, rebidding of dominant generators, the temporary or permanent outage of major power stations, and upgrades and limitations in transmission capacity. In the analysed network, we find that stronger dependence is exhibited by regional markets that are linked through interconnectors, while the direction of Granger causality can be related to interregional trade. We further examine the usefulness of the derived measures for forecasting distributional characteristics of spot prices such as the maximum price, volatility, price spreads, or upcoming periods of price spikes. Our results suggest that the derived network measures have predictive power, albeit limited, for the behaviour of spot electricity prices in the NEM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Dependence and interconnectedness; Dynamic networks; Electricity markets; Multivariate analysis; Risk management; Spot prices,Electric industry; Power markets; Statistical tests; Dynamic network analysis; Granger Causality; National electricity markets; Network measures; Price volatility; Regional markets; Spot electricity prices; Transmission capacities; Costs; electricity supply; energy market; multivariate analysis; price dynamics; risk assessment; Australia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we assess the performance of four machine learning models that forecast the electricity price. Next, we rank the variables according to their importance and identify to what extent different estimators and feature selection methods affect the performance of the forecasting models. We found that Random Forest regression is the best performing model regardless of the number of features selected and the feature selection method applied. Secondly, the performance of all models was not found to improve significantly after the selection of the top 15 ranked variables.

We tailor a recently introduced econometric model with fundamental impacts, which is successful in describing the pricing of day contracts. Our estimation results show that the mean reversion and the positive price impact of neighboring contracts are generic features of the price formation process on the intraday market, independent of the time of day. Intraday auction prices have higher explanatory power for the pricing of night than day contracts, particularly, for the first and last 15-min. contract in a night hour. Intradaily updated forecasts of wind power infeed are the only significant fundamental factors for intraday electricity prices at night. Neither expected conventional capacities nor the slope of the merit order curve contribute to explaining price dynamics.

In this paper, we propose a joint model for day-ahead electricity prices in interconnected markets composed of a combination of transformed Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes. We discuss the properties of the model and propose an estimation procedure based on filtering techniques. Furthermore, the properties of the model reveal that analytical prices are attainable for, e.g., forwards and spread options. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Day-ahead electricity prices; Derivative pricing; Interconnected markets; Stochastic modelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the 2014 World Bank series on energy and extractive industries, Rwanda has very low electrification levels. She has renewable energy potential for solar, hydro, methane gas, biomass, geothermal energy and currently investigations on wind is underway. Rwanda still boosts low access to electricity and high electricity prices compared to her neighboring countries. This paper proposes a new electricity pricing model that can be used to forecast the price in the Rwandan electricity market that is projected to be dominated with RES.

"Zhang C., Li R., Shi H., Li F.",Deep learning for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2020,,"Deregulation exposes the inherent volatility of the electricity price. Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) could help the market participants to hedge against the price movements and maximise their profits. The existing methods have limited capability of integrating other external factors into the forecasting model, such as weather, electricity consumption and natural gas price. This study proposes a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) method to forecast day-ahead electricity price in a deregulated electricity market to explore the complex dependence structure of the multivariate EPF model. The proposed method can learn the indirect relationship between electricity price and external factors through its efficient diverse function and multi-layer structure. The effectiveness of the method is validated using data from the New England electricity market. Compared with the up-to-date techniques, the proposed DRNN outperforms the single support vector machine (SVM) by 29.71%, and the improved hybrid SVM network by 21.04% in terms of mean absolute percentage error. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Numerous predictors are analyzed to reduce the mean absolute percentage error. The training data includes the dates from September 2018 to September 2019 from the day-ahead electricity market in Turkey. It is proved that the lagged electricity prices such as the previous one day, one week, and lagged moving average prices play a key role in electricity price estimation. Aside from other valuable coefficients, natural gas, oil, and coal prices are tested in the forecasting model. The error rates of the fuel prices are noticeably shrunk by using multiple linear regression that generates more accurate results and crucial variables influencing hourly electricity price has determined. Different training data length is an essential part of decreasing the error proportions in the electricity price estimation. Also, it is analyzed that there is no dramatic difference regarding the error rates if it is compared to the regular regression method and dynamic regression model in the forecast of electricity prices. © 2020 IEEE.",Dynamic regression; Electricity price forecasting; Fuel price impact; Multiple linear regression,Cost estimating; Digital storage; Errors; Forecasting; Linear regression; Power electronics; Day-ahead electricity market; Dynamic regression models; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting modeling; Mean absolute percentage error; Multiple linear regression method; Multiple linear regressions; Regular regression; Crude oil price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marwan M.,The impact of probability of electricity price spike and outside temperature to define total expected cost for air conditioning,2020,,"The purpose of this paper is to address the problems experienced by customers in the utilisation of electrical energy for air conditioners (ACs). According to the proposed schema in this paper, the customer will be able to evaluate the impacts of a probable electricity price spike and the outside temperature (Tout) to calculate the total expected electricity cost for an AC (TEC). The aim of this paper is to show how consumers can estimate the TEC for any temperature. In this research, a model considering two types of price spikes (PS) is developed, namely: short-duration and long-duration spikes. To evaluate and examine this model, spike durations of half hour, one hour, and one and half hour were simulated to determine TEC. This proposed schema also examines how the control system applies a pre-cooling method if there is a substantial risk of PS. The results present possible savings on the electrical energy consumption when the consumer applies this method to anticipate spike events.

In this sense, there is an urgent need for all market participants to identify the pivotal aspects of electricity market price fluctuation effectively and anticipate its future trend. For certain applications such as DSM, considering the high volatility and nonlinear of real-time electricity price, we can approximate the interval prediction to achieve the multi-classification that relies on critical pattern recognition of entire category of the price sequence. Therefore, this paper presents a study on the utilization of a novel electricity price classification framework which consists of Bayesian extreme learning machine (BELM) model, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm, and multivariate sequence segmentation (MSS). Considering many advantages of deep learning structure in capturing the hierarchical and sophisticated characteristics of multidimensional sequence, the multi-layer BELM (ML-BELM) model is also extended and utilized to the modeling. To demonstrate the potential of the pattern classification framework, the proposed approaches are evaluated using hourly clearing price cases from Canada Ontario and New York electricity market. In particular, we investigate the performance of different classifiers regarding the 3 multi-classification and higher dimensional classification modes with respect to various scenarios in terms of precision, recall, AUC (Area Under roc Curve) score, and F1-measure indicators. The findings suggest that the proposed pattern classification framework can obtain satisfactory forecasting results provided that suitable scheme is utilized to the pattern segmentation and feature ranking process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian extreme learning machine; Deep learning; Electricity market price prediction; Pattern classification,Commerce; Deep learning; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Long short-term memory; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Power markets; Area under roc curve (AUC); Classification framework; Extreme learning machine; Interval prediction; Market price; Minimum redundancy-maximum relevances; Modeling and forecasting; Multi-classification; Classification (of information); alternative energy; Bayesian analysis; comparative study; energy market; forecasting method; machine learning; modeling; price determination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the limited market activity of crop straws, this paper uses the contingent valuation method to elicit farmers' willingness-to-accept (WTA) price to sell their crop straws in northeast China. The results from finite mixed models showed that the estimated WTA for maize straw was 9.6 yuan/ton, 43.2 yuan/ton and 83.2 yuan/ton across different farm groups. For rice straw, the WTA for the first farm group was 51 yuan/ton and 204 yuan/ton for the second group.

The proposed method is applied to one- and two-factor stochastic models, using both simulated and real data. The results demonstrate good agreement between the maximum likelihood and MCMC point estimates.

Sharimakin A.,Measuring the energy input substitution and output effects of energy price changes and the implications for the environment,2019,,"Previous studies of decomposition of factor inputs have limited their analysis on the estimation of substitution and output effects. However, this paper develops a two-step approach to estimate the substitution and output effects of changes in energy demand resulting from changes in prices and further examines the implications of these effects on CO2 emissions using European industrial dataset over the period 1995–2007. In our empirical estimations, instead of relying only on iSUR model like previous studies, we introduced a multilevel model, which is a more befitting model to our data. Our analysis covers industry as a whole and for different sector types. The primary results emerged from our analysis suggest a strong evidence using the multilevel model. Generally, our results show that production inputs are substitutable. We find the substitution and output effects to be negatively related to CO2 emissions, however, the substitution effects dominate. From policy perspectives, our results suggest that output adjustments may not play a significant role in reducing emissions. We find the overall effects of changes in energy demand to be moderate. Then, we argue that increment in energy taxes should be complemented by cleaner factor substitution and sustainable growth to achieve a desirable carbon reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon emissions; Decomposition effects; European industries; Substitution elasticities,Carbon dioxide; Energy management; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Taxation; Carbon emissions; Empirical estimations; European industry; Factor substitutions; Reducing emissions; Substitution effect; Sustainable growth; Two-step approach; Industrial emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; demand elasticity; energy market; energy policy; price dynamics; substitution; Europe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we provide empirical evidence that the Modification Proposal P12 (Mod P12) - that took place in 7/2/2002 - moving the Gate Closure (GC) interval from 3.5 h to 1 h before real time has caused a permanent alteration in the UK spot price volatility. Using a combination of Recurrence Plot (RP) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) we find that, after the the change in the GC time, short term price volatility significantly decreased between 2001 and 2008 while long term price volatility is not affected by CG change. Similar results are obtained by means of spectral analysis on the price series, showing a significant reduction in its variability. The results of our analysis suggest that a dynamical regime shift of the price occurred, and such shift is linked to the GC change whereby shorter GC intervals facilitate short-term forecasting on electricity demand and better reliability on the supply side. Therefore, GC closer to real time is associated to reduced price fluctuations in the wholesale market. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Electricicty markets; Gate Closure UK Spot prices; New Electricity Trading arrangements; Recurrence Plots,Commerce; Costs; Reliability analysis; Spectrum analysis; Speech processing; Electricity demands; New electricity trading arrangements; Recurrence plot; Recurrence quantification analysis; Short-term forecasting; Spot price; Spot price volatility; Wholesale electricity; Power markets; demand elasticity; electricity industry; electricity supply; energy policy; price dynamics; regulatory approach; United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shayegan-Rad A., Zangeneh A.",Optimal contract pricing of load aggregators for direct load control in smart distribution systems,2019,,"Distribution system operators (DSOs) are interested in demand side participation programs as an efficient and secure resource to manage electricity supply and demand. However, it is usually difficult for DSOs to aggregate demand response of large/small consumers. Thus, in some electricity markets, an entity called an aggregator is defined to aggregate the load response of consumers. In this paper a bilevel scheduling model is proposed to determine the long-term optimal contract price between the DSO and aggregator for executing direct load control in smart distribution systems. The DSO and aggregator are considered as two different agents with individual objectives in the proposed bilevel scheduling model. On the one hand, the aggregator maximizes its profit by bidding load reduction of the large consumers to the DSO by executing a direct load control (DLC) mechanism, and on the other hand, the DSO tries to minimize its overall cost to supply all consumers. The DSO has two options to follow the variation of its consumers’ demand: purchasing energy from the electricity market and executing DLC programs. The bilevel programming formulation is transferred into an equivalent single level programming problem using its Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions. Moreover, the uncertainties of the electricity market price, demand of consumers, and generation of a wind power plant are modeled via point estimate method. Two typical case studies are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling model. © TÜBİTAK.",Bilevel optimization; Karush–Kuhn–Tucker; Load aggregator; Optimal contract pricing; Point estimate method,Aggregates; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Power markets; Scheduling; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Bi-level optimization; Bi-level programming; Demand side participations; Electricity supply and demands; Optimal contract; Optimality conditions; Point estimate method; Smart distribution systems; Electric load management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electricity price forecasting is key for devising optimal bidding strategies for WPPs as well as for efficient energy management of BESS. This paper discusses the opportunities for WPPs if they participate in wind energy trading.

"Than M.M., Thein T.",Electricity Price Prediction for Geographically Distributed Data Centers in Multi-Region Electricity Markets,2018,,"Geographically distributed data centens (GDCs) serving as infrastructures for cloud services, are growing in both number and scale. They usually consume enormous amount of electric power, which lead to high operational costs and this has been recognized as a main challenge in cloud computing. Energy cost can be reduced by directing the requests to the favor of data center with lower electricity price by incorporating spatially and temporally price diversity, especially in the multi-region electricity markets. If the electricity prices of data centers are predicted in advance, the cloud provider can reduce energy cost. An efficient electricity price prediction is needed for minimizing electricity bill of GDCs. This paper proposes electricity price prediction for GDCs in multi-region electricity markets.

For an optimal strategy development, both the internal system costs and the future values of the series of electricity prices in external markets need to be known. But in practice, the real problems that must be faced are that both future electricity prices and costs are unknown. Thus, the first ones must be modelled and forecasted and the costs must be calculated.

The second step is the cost calculation on internal system taking into account the expected prices in the first step. The third step is based on the results of the previous steps, and consists of preparing the bids for external markets with the focus on the consumer's cost.

"Rajaraman B., Vesovic B.",Convergence of prices and efficiency of day-ahead markets,2014,,"The constantly changing grid operating conditions, the need to maintain a balance between demand and supply of electricity in real time, and the evolution of an electricity market in certain electric interconnections of the world, are some of the characteristics of today's electric power systems. The interlaced design of a power system and electricity market operations are closely linked with the system reliability and electricity market efficiency. Accurate convergence of prices between the day-ahead electricity markets (DAM) and the associated real time energy markets (RTM) is a good indicator of a well functioning electricity market. Consistency between DAM and RTM prices is beneficial for market efficiency because it helps ensure that the resources committed each day are the most economic and efficient ones to meet the system demand in real time, thereby preserving system reliability and security. The divergence of RTM electricity prices from DAM electricity prices imposes unnecessary additional inefficiencies and costs on the system, thereby potentially threatening system reliability. Virtual bidding in the day-ahead market provides a useful function in facilitating price convergence between the day ahead and real time markets. The arbitrage possibilities enabled by virtual bidding are also useful mechanisms for improving efficiency in the electricity markets. By adding liquidity to the market, virtual bidding significantly helps in reducing market risk for participants and considerably reduces price volatility as well. Network congestion, which is also seen as a key reason for price spikes and consequently price divergence in electricity markets can be managed efficiently and effectively by implementing a full network model. A detailed and accurate representation of the power system, which aids in the determination and mitigation of transmission constraints, will lead to consistency of congestion patterns between DAM and RTM, thereby contributing to improved convergence of electricity prices in market operations. The insufficient ramping capability in any system may trigger power balance violations resulting in an infeasible real time dispatch that cannot maintain supply and demand power balance. In such scenarios, the system has to rely on regulation services to resolve the issue in real-time after the imbalance has caused area control error (ACE) deviation. If there is insufficient regulation service, the shortage in ramping capability may result in leaning on the interconnection, which is an undesirable outcome. Moreover, when power balance is violated, the RTM energy price is not priced by economic bids, but by administrative penalty prices, which may impact market efficiency in the long run. These price spikes generally may be avoided by further modelling and dispatch improvements that increase the accuracy and flexibility of real-time dispatches. Market design improvements such as implementation of flexible ramp system constraints, that ensure additional unloaded online capacity that is available and ramp feasible, and can be dispatched at any time interval in either upward or downward direction by designating a system ramp margin, must be made available. This paper discusses several aspects needed for improved price convergence and thereby increased efficiency in electricity markets, such as virtual bidding, flexible ramping constraints, implementing a full network model for alleviating network congestion, advanced forecasting systems and demand response. The paper also provides illustrations and examples to demonstrate the impact of price convergence on market efficiency. © 2014 CIGRE.

Li H.,Scheduling of wireless metering for power market pricing in smart grid,2012,,"Remote metering is a key task in smart grid to collect the power load information for the pricing in power market. A wireless communication infrastructure is assumed for the smart meter network. The dynamics of the power market are assumed to be a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by modeling the power load evolution as a two-state Markov chain. The fundamental elements of the MDP are discussed and the optimal strategy is obtained from Dynamic Programming. Due to the curse of dimensions, the myopic strategy is proposed to significantly simplify the algorithm. The validity of the proposed scheduling algorithm is demonstrated using numerical simulations. For example, for price insensitive power users, the average price and power generation errors are reduced by 60% and 40% using the myopic approach, compared with the simple round robin schedule, in certain circumstances. © 2012 IEEE.",,Markov Decision Processes; Myopic strategies; Optimal strategies; Power load; Power markets; Power users; Round-robin schedule; Smart grid; Smart meters; Two-state Markov chains; Wireless communications; Commerce; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Markov processes; Wireless telecommunication systems; Smart power grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"De Weerdt M., Ketter W., Collins J.",Pricing mechanism for real-time balancing in regional electricity markets,2011,,"In electricity markets, supply and demand have to be balanced perfectly in real time. A major task of the Independent Systems Operator (ISO)2 on the wholesale (transmission) level and of the Distribution Utility (DU) on the regional (distribution) level is to monitor the grid and to maintain balance while keeping voltage, frequency, and power factor within very tight bounds. This task gets more challenging as more renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are connected to the grid [2]. Many of these sources (e.g. wind) are only partially predictable. The grid balancing problem has been studied on various levels (wholesale vs. retail) and with different approaches [1]. We study the problem of how to determine the price that energy brokers (retailers) need to pay in case their profile of consumption and production of electricity is imbalanced in the current time slot.3 In a retail electricity market, brokers have the possibility to control some portion of customer production and consumption, such as by offering price concessions in exchange for the ability to remotely interrupt loads or sources for limited periods of time. Examples of such controllable loads are remotely controlled CHPs (Combined Heat and Power - gas turbines that supply both heat and power, and allow some control of production) and domestic water heaters that can be remotely turned off to temporarily reduce consumption. We present two different scenarios and the related market mechanisms to balance supply and demand: I) without controllable loads, and II) with controllable loads for the current time slot. Our main mechanisms for a regional real-time balancing market are efficient, and create an incentive to resolve imbalances in the day-ahead market. An advantage of our methods is that they are compatible with existing energy market structures (keeping the day-ahead market as a given), and therefore the required restructuring would be less disruptive than with other methods currently suggested.",,Balancing market; Balancing problems; Combined heat and power; Controllable loads; Customer production; Day ahead market; Distribution utilities; Domestic water heaters; Electricity market; Existing energies; Heat and power; Independent systems; Market mechanisms; Power factors; Price concessions; Pricing mechanism; Real time; Regional electricity markets; Renewable energy source; Retail electricity markets; Supply and demand; Tight bound; Time slots; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Electric power factor; Electricity; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Water heaters; Economics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
De M.,Pricing system security in deregulated market including voltage stability constraint,2011,,"This paper proposes a pricing system for power system security in deregulated market, which includes voltage stability constraint (VSC). The VSC is included in a multi-objective optimal power flow (OPF) that maximizes the social benefit. Ancillary service (reactive power) and system congestion has been considered in the pricing. Effect ofN-1 contingency on pricing is also analyzed. Pricing is decided one day ahead using forecasted demand data. The OPF is solved by linear programming method. The system is divided into three areas for which total transfer capacity (TTC) is calculated by repeated power flow technique. The available transfer capacity decides the amount of congestion that affects the pricing. The voltage stability is ascertained by checking the singularity of the system Jacobian matrix. Finally, effect of line/generator loss on pricing system is studied. The model is tested on modified IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus systems and is implemented using MATLAB programming.",Congestion; N-1 contingency; Pricing structure; System security; Voltage stability constraint,Congestion; N-1 contingencies; Pricing structures; System security; Voltage stability constraints; Commerce; Deregulation; Jacobian matrices; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"J́onsson T., Pinson P., Madsen H.",The effect ofwind power forecasts on electricity prices in Denmark,2008,,"For participants in deregulated energy markets as Nord Pool and EEX, forecasting of the electricity prices can be just as important as load and production forecasts when it comes to controlling production and consumption. Furthermore, price forecasts are paramount when it comes to designing bidding strategies. It is a known fact that electricity prices on the Nord Pool spot market are, in the long run, mainly influenced by the level of water in the reservoirs of the Norwegian and Swedish hydropower plants. However, changes in the water level happen slowly and are therefore not a matter of great relevance when 1 to 36 hour forecasts are made for the prices on Nord Pool spot market. In this paper, the effects of forecasted wind power production on the spot prices in Nord Pool's Western Danish price area (DK-1) are investigated. Moreover, ways of including the forecasted wind power production in a model for the spot price in DK-1 are explored. It turns out that forecasted wind power production has substantial effects on the spot price and even more effects can be found with small modifications. By using conditional parametric models and by converting the forecasted production into a forecasted penetration, a very satisfying degree of explanation can be achieved in forecasting models for the spot prices in DK-1. Given the result of this paper, it is very likely that the same approach to use wind power predictions, will give good results when forecasting the prices on other electricity pools. It is expected that the approach will be highly beneficial both for pools where wind power penetration is relatively high, and for markets with other characteristics, such as regulation markets.",Electricity spot prices; Forecasting; Statistical modeling; Wind power,Bidding strategy; Denmark; Deregulated energy market; Electricity pool; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Forecasting models; Hydropower plants; Parametric models; Power forecast; Price forecasts; Production forecasts; Regulation markets; Spot market; Spot price; Statistical modeling; Wind power penetration; Wind power predictions; Wind power production; Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Exhibitions; Forecasting; Lakes; Reservoirs (water); Water levels; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Electric load forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under deregulation, a free market approach to buying and selling the electricity is established. In a deregulated power market, electricity producers generally follow a marginal cost based price fixing strategy. Accordingly, each utility firm follows their own pricing strategy in the market. Absence of a general model to determine the optimal electricity price at the generator end leads to non-standard pricing practices by different generators. The proposed model was formulated based on performance incentive and penalty considering peak/off-peak loads, plant load factor and availability of the plant. The developed model was applied to a typical hydroelectric utility in India to determine the electricity price. Results show that the percentage error in estimated value falls within the limits.",Deregulation; Electricity price; Power market; Profit maximization,Deregulated electricity market; Deregulated power markets; Developed model; Electricity price; Electricity prices; Electricity producers; Free market; General model; Generating stations; Marginal costs; Peak load; Percentage error; Plant load factor; Power markets; Pricing practices; Pricing strategy; Profit maximization; Commerce; Costs; Electric generators; Electric substations; Electric utilities; Electric variables measurement; Electricity; Hydroelectric power plants; Mathematical models; Optimization; Profitability; Deregulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tariffs for electricity and - optionally - heat created with our pricing model are optimal in terms of the utility's profit and take into account the consumers' predicted behavior, their load curve, the utility's generation prices, and prices for trading electricity on a day-ahead market like the European Energy Exchange (EEX). Furthermore, we analyze the repercussions of different assumptions about consumer behavior on a simulated market with four competing utilities. Consumer demand is modeled using an attraction model that reflects consumer inertia. Consumers will not always change their supplier, even if the total energy bill could be reduced by doing so: First, motivation to search for lower prices and to actually switch one's supplier is low, given the small possible savings. Second, legal constraints may demand a minimal contract duration in some countries. The resulting nonlinear profit optimization problem of the suppliers is solved with a genetic algorithm. By varying the attraction parameters and thus representing different degrees of inertia, we observe different developments of the market.",,Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Genetic algorithms; Information analysis; Profitability; Consumer demands; Day ahead market; Energy suppliers; European energy exchanges; Generation prices; Legal constraint; Profit optimization; Utility markets; Consumer behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dugan V., Solea R.",Pricing fuzzy models approach for decision-making in power systems electricity transactions,2007,,"The paper uses fuzzy set theory to obtain some fuzzy models which can be useful, each, as a decision - support to estimate an electrical energy (EE) price for consumers. In the same time, according to us, the paper can be a possible benchmark example of approximate reasoning, used as a fuzzy decision-support system. All three fuzzy tariff models developed in fuzzy environment, integrate some specific features of a deregulated electricity market, as in Romania in this transition period: i) in the market is only a single ""seller"", SC Electrica SA (SCESA), i.e. a single-supplier of electrical energy; ii) because of this, the consumers interests, beginning with 1999, are protected by the National Authority of Settlements from Energy (NASE) through some (social) compulsions; iii) the average price of EE ($/MWh) near our market place is, obviously, a real problem (in our case the markets are from: Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia and Moldavia). Not being a competitive environment, the normal practice used in NASE rules as method of EE pricing are average costs, i.e. total costs divided by total sales. The fuzzy method shows how it is possible to perform sensitivity tests on the EE price function model (by changing the parameters of SCESA and NASE), until can obtain an acceptable and true price can be obtained. In this aim, the three fuzzy models use different rules for pricing: conservative, aggressive, and different order of words concerning the rules, and finally doing a comparation among prices and models. Though the paper will not exhaust all fuzzy rules, doubtlessly, create a way of fuzzy reasoning, as a modality to find an EE price.

But, like many countries, Japan is moving forward with the deregulation of its electric power industry so that any power generation company could sell electric power in the market. The power price, however, will fluctuate inevitably to balance the power supply and demand. A new appropriate market design is indispensable when introducing new market mechanisms in the electric power market to avoid undesirable results of the market. The first stage of deregulation will be the competition between an existing large-scaled power utility and a new power generation company. In this paper we have investigated the wholesale market with competition of these two power companies based on a simulation model approach. Under the competitive situation the effects of exogenous disturbance may bring serious results and we estimated the influence on the market when the price of fossil fuel rises. The conclusion of this study is that several types of Nash equilibriums have been found in the market: the larger the new power generation company becomes, the higher the electricity price under the Nash equilibriums rises. Because of the difference in their structure of generation capacity, the existing large-scaled power utility gets more profit while the new power generation company loses its profit when the price of fossil fuel rises.",Crude Oil Price; Nash Equilibrium; Power Pool Market; Simulation Analysis,Competition; Computer simulation; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Marketing; Mathematical models; Crude Oil Price; Nash Equilibrium; Power Pool Markets; Simulation Analysis; Electric power systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since there are multiple existing state estimators distributed with different owners in one ISO/RTO/Mega-RTO, these neighboring estimators in single power market can exchange their data, where the term 'data' refers to both raw instrumentation data and estimation results of other estimators. It has been demonstrated in our previous publications that carefully selected data exchange schemes improve the quality of estimators in individual entities on both estimation reliability and accuracy. In addition, data exchange is critical for the newly proposed textured distributed state estimation algorithm over the whole Mega-RTO grid. Since all the activities in a market environment need to be evaluated in terms of 'price', the following questions then arise: how to price data exchange activities in a power market? And how to search for the most valuable data exchange schemes in term of market price? In this paper a pricing methodology for data exchange is proposed based on the concept of marginal price. Furthermore, a systematic approach to search for the most valuable data exchange schemes is proposed based on some heuristic rules.

Spies P.,Variable electricity prices for aluminium smelting in northwestern USA,1990,,"Bonneville Power Administration, the marketing agency for the federally developed regional electric power system, has served power to a large part of the US aluminium industry for 50 years. During the last decade changes in regional energy economics and legislation have led to steeply rising power rates. These rate increases collided with an aluminium industry itself under-going structural changes, resulting in increased competition and poor market conditions. This situation threatened not only aluminium smelting capacity, but also Bonneville's financial condition, which depends heavily on aluminium power sales revenue. The solution was a programme designed to increase the flexibility and predictability of power rates and provide incentives to restore the competitiveness of the regional industry.

Schramm G.,Relative price changes and the benefits and costs of alternative power projects,1969,,"What are the conclusions that we have to draw from the foregoing discussion? We must conclude that the prevailing practice of evaluating benefits and costs in terms of present costs and prices is not only likely to lead to an under-statement of actual costs, but also may lead to gross inefficiencies in project selection. This danger is particularly great in cases of hydro projects with long construction time horizons or long-term project sequences that depend for their feasibility on some common facility. While the need to estimate future price relationships may seem to introduce new uncertainties into project evaluations the use of prevailing prices is even less satisfactory. A somewhat inaccurate estimate of future changes, as long as it points in the right direction and as long as it is backed up by a sensitivity analysis that tests the effects of the assumptions on overall benefits and costs will provide a better and more realistic picture. Today this issue is of particular urgency since the traditional cost advantage of hydro over thermal alternatives is quickly disappearing. Given the very dramatic cost reductions expected from the introduction of second and third generation atomic power plants it becomes mandatory for any power system planner to take these expected changes explicitly into account. © 1969 Annals of Regional Science.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Muchayi Maxwell, El-Hawary M.E.",Method for optimal pricing of electric supply including transmission system considerations,1997,,"Determining real-time electricity rate structures is currently receiving a great deal attention. In this paper, a strategy for pricing electricity supply is formulated and evaluated. Unlike other methods which use only the variation of fuel cost for generation to estimate the rate structures, the proposed pricing algorithm incorporates the optimal allocation of transmission system operating costs based on time-of-use pricing. The transmission costs are obtained by assigning a price k to each unit of power flow in the network. The assignment does not discriminate between participants located at differing parts of the network. The real-time pricing reflects the instantaneous cost of production and functions as a load management tool because this interacts with consumer behavior. The demand for power flows and transmission on an electricity supply system, like the demand for any bundle of economic goods, depends upon the assigned transmission prices, together with the economic benefit to the consumer. It is assumed that there are no privately owned generating plants and that all plants and transmission lines are operated by the utility. The modeling scheme is applied to the IEEE standard 5, 14, 30 and 57 bus power systems and involves solving a modified optimal power flow problem (OPF) iteratively using the MINOS package. It is concluded that the method has a wide potential application in electricity supply pricing.",,,Algorithms; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Electric rates; Industrial economics; Iterative methods; Optimization; Resource allocation; Standards; Transmission network calculations; Electricity supply pricing; Software package MINOS; Electric utilities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Sioshansi R., Short W.",Evaluating the impacts of real-time pricing on the usage of wind generation,2009,153.0,"One of the impediments to large-scale use of wind generation within power systems is its nondispatchability and variable and uncertain real-time availability. Operating constraints on conventional generators such as minimum generation points, forbidden zones, and ramping limits as well as system constraints such as power flow limits and ancillary service requirements may force a system operator to curtail wind generation in order to ensure feasibility. Furthermore, the pattern of wind availability and electricity demand may not allow wind generation to be fully utilized in all hours. One solution to these issues, which could reduce these inflexibilities, is the use of real-time pricing (RTP) tariffs which can both smooth-out the diurnal load pattern in order to reduce the impact of binding unit operating and system constraints on wind utilization, and allow demand to increase in response to the availability of costless wind generation. We use and analyze a detailed unit commitment model of the Texas power system with different estimates of demand elasticities to demonstrate the potential increases in wind generation from implementing RTP. © 2009 IEEE.",,Power system economics; Real-time pricing; Unit commitment; Variable renewable energy resources; Wind power generation,Ancillary service; Demand elasticities; Electricity demands; Load patterns; Non-dispatchability; Operating constraints; Power flows; Power system economics; Power systems; Real-time pricing; System constraints; System operator; Time availability; Unit commitment; Unit commitments; Variable renewable energy resources; Wind generation; Wind utilizations; Costs; Economics; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Internet protocols; Power transmission; Rapid thermal annealing; Real time systems; Wind power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The general result from the traditional theory charges the off-peak consumers marginal operating costs only and the peak users marginal operating plus marginal capacity cost. Theoretical attempts at modification have proved that the traditional conclusion holds only for homogeneous plant capacity (e.g., in one plant case), and in economic loading of two or more plants, the off-peak price also includes a part of capacity costs. This paper, however, shows that if the off-peak period output is explicitly expressed in terms of capacity utilisation of that period, the result will be an off-peak price including a fraction of the capacity cost in proportion to its significance relative to total utilisation. This would appear as a general case, irrespective of the nature of generation technology, that is, ever when there is only one plant.

In the year 2003 alone 8,133 MW of new installations have been built up. When integrating these huge amount of wind power into an existing power grid and the trading process of a power utility on the electricity market, the uncertainty in wind power generation becomes a critical point. There are basically two viewpoints on this issue. First, operating wind power generation in a power grid needs a high amount of regulation reserve. Therefore wind generation is expensive. On the other hand, wind power generation does not consume fuel and therefore there are no fuel cost. To estimate the consequences of high wind power generation we propose in this paper a simulation model that is capable of simulating spot and ancillary markets, as well as the physical aspects of electricity generation.

"Covas R., Pascual L.",Pricing daily electricity transfer capacities in the Spain - France interconnection,2008,,"Nowadays, it is possible to sell energy across countries using the existing interconnections. In Europe, one example is the interconnection between France and Spain. These interconnections have limited capacity. Therefore, the right to use the interconnections becomes a valuable position for the different companies and players, due to the spread of electricity prices between countries. The transfer capacities are obtained in annual, monthly, daily and intra-day transfer auctions. This fact is well known by market players, who daily attend capacity auctions, on which they bid in order to gain access to the network. Actually, around 26 companies are entitled to attend these auctions. As a first approach, in order to set your bids for the daily auctions, the access to the network is valued through the Black & Scholes Formulas for the European Call Spread Option. This approach is based on forecasts for the hourly prices in both countries, and on the hourly correlation between them. Since selling energy across countries implies, additionally, offer and demand bids for electricity in each country, thus having positive probabilities of negative cashflows, the option to use transfer capacities cannot be priced with the Black-Scholes Formulas. In this work we propose a new way of pricing the daily electricity transfer capacity, where we take into account the trader's daily operation and, therefore, all the inherent risks factors not included in the Black & Scholes world. We support our proposal by comparing our results with real auction values, and the ones obtained with the Black & Scholes approach. ©2008 IEEE.",,Conditional expectation; Day and intra-day electricity market; Multivariate normal distribution; Spread option; Transfer capacities auction,Arsenic compounds; Commerce; Computer networks; Costs; Industrial economics; Ketones; Occupational risks; Conditional expectation; Day and intra-day electricity market; Multivariate normal distribution; Spread option; Transfer capacities auction; Electric load forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Xie L., Zheng H., Fan G.-Y.",Price volatility analysis by Grey disaster theory,2008,,"Since the electricity market came into being, price volatility is along a difficult and unavoidable problem that makes the market participants face with great risks. But due to the short development of the deregulation, price and its relative data are insufficient, and then price researches have become a typical small-sampled problem. No doubt, such data condition have restricted the application and generalization ability of traditional methods. Then volatility analysis on the electricity price is along a focused and hot problem in the research fields of the electricity market. To solve the above problems, a novel model for price volatility analysis is proposed by Grey disaster prediction, which aims at forecasting when the next price volatility will happen. After studying on the tendency when the price volatilities happen, this work builds a Grey Model to performing the price volatility prediction. Finally numerical experiments are applied to test the validity of the proposed model. ©2008 IEEE.",,,Accidents; Electric load forecasting; Electronics industry; Forecasting; Industrial electronics; Modal analysis; Occupational risks; Risk assessment; Disaster prediction; Electricity markets; Electricity pricing; Generalization ability; Grey models; Market participants; Numerical experiments; Price volatility; Research fields; Electric network analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pingping W., Ruigui Y.",Allocation trules in the EU ETS: Impact on electricity prices and economic efficiency,2009,,"This paper demonstrates that cost-free allocation, commonly called grandfathering, implies an increase in electricity prices even when strong competition prevails on electricity markets. As our estimations for Germany's power sector show, these price increases result in substantial windfall profits, giving rise to public skepticism and calls for an auctioning of certificates in the future. While empirical evidence on the ETS' impacts is scant, the findings reviewed here indicate that even in the absence of certificate auctioning, energy-intensive industry sectors may suffer heavily from the ETS-induced electricity price increases. We argue that an abrupt transition to a complete auctioning system may endanger the competitive position of energy-intensive industries in Europe, unless all other major industrial and transition countries are integrated into a global emissions trading system. ©2009 IEEE.",,Auctioning; Cost-free allocation; Emission Trading Scheme (ETS); Grandfathering,Abrupt transition; Competitive position; Economic efficiency; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Emission trading scheme; Emission Trading Scheme (ETS); Empirical evidence; Energy intensive industries; Free allocation; Germany; Global emissions; Power sector; Price increase; Air quality; Civil aviation; Commerce; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Profitability; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Helmke A.C.,"Wind energy auction in Brazil prices, barriers, opportunities",2010,,"Since a severe energy crisis in 2001, Brazil has been exploring the vast potential - estimated at between 60 and 143 GW - of its wind resources. The federal government's promotion scheme Proinfa - based on a feed-in tariff - saw the installation of 1.422 MW. But Proinfa did not meet all stakeholder expectations. Projects were selected based on the issuing date of the environmental license, and wind turbines were not readily available. As a result Proinfa's tenure was extended twice. However, never before had a programme of its scale been attempted in Latin America. Presently, wind energy production is being encouraged through reverse auctions. This mirrors the Brazilian electricity market, which is also auction based. These auctions award PPAs to the lowest bidder. The first auction for wind energy took place at the end of December 2009. Some 1.800 MW of wind energy were contracted at an average price of approximately 60 Euros/MWh. The first auction drew significant interest from the sector which submitted backlogged projects. Barriers to market development like state-level taxation and grid-connection issues are offset by accessible public loans, several turbine manufacturers operating in Brazil, wind-hydro complementarity, increased political awareness, and the involvement of local utilities in the sector. As the sector has matured, the time to deliver operating projects has arrived. Long term promotion goals should also be formulated. If following these steps Brazil is in an excellent position to be the regional leader in wind energy.",,Brazilian electricity markets; Energy crisis; Federal governments; Feed-in tariff; Grid connections; Latin America; Market development; Operating project; Reverse auction; Time-to-deliver; Wind energy production; Wind resources; Energy policy; Exhibitions; Taxation; Wind power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Schulz F.C., Mosler K.",The effect of infrequent trading on detecting price jumps,2011,,"The subject of the present study is to analyze how accurately an elaborated price jump detection methodology by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (J. Financ. Econom. 2:1-37, 2004a; 4:1-30, 2006) applies to financial time series characterized by less frequent trading. In this context, it is of primary interest to understand the impact of infrequent trading on two test statistics, applicable to disentangle contributions from price jumps to realized variance. In a simulation study, evidence is found that infrequent trading induces a sizable distortion of the test statistics towards overrejection. A new empirical investigation using high frequency information of the most heavily traded electricity forward contract of the Nord Pool Energy Exchange corroborates the evidence of the simulation.

"Le Coq C., Orzen H.",Price caps and fluctuating demands in electricity markets: Experimental evidence of competitive bidding,2012,,"This paper reports results from a laboratory experiment designed to test how competitive behavior is sensitive to price cap and demand level in a uniform price auction. Several features of the electricity markets inspire the experimental design. Two treatments with different price caps are considered and demand is high in certain periods, and low in others. In addition the market is characterized by excess capacity regardless of the demand level and competitive outcome is predicted. Although attempts to collude do take place, these fail to increase market prices in any substantial way. Despite this, inefficiencies do occur as the attempts at colluding imply that marginal costs fail to equalize across firms. This allocative inefficiencies appear to be more severe, both when the demand is high and when the price cap is high. © 2012 IEEE.",Industrial economics Oligopoly Power generation economics Electricity supply industry deregulation; Microeconomics,Competitive behavior; Competitive bidding; Electricity market; Excess capacity; Experimental evidence; Laboratory experiments; Marginal costs; Market price; Microeconomics; Power generation economics; Price caps; Uniform price auction; Commerce; Competition; Economics; Electric power generation; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Lopez-Lezama J.M., Padilha-Feltrin A., Contreras J., Muñoz J.I.",Optimal contract pricing of distributed generation in distribution networks,2011,70.0,"This paper proposes a bilevel programming approach to determine the optimal contract price of dispatchable distributed generation (DG) units in distribution systems. Two different agents are considered in the model, namely, the distribution company (DisCo) and the owner of the DG. The former seeks the minimization of the payments incurred in attending the forecasted demand, while the latter seeks the maximization of his profit. To meet the expected demand, the DisCo has the option to purchase energy from any DG unit within its network and directly from the wholesale electricity market. A traditional distribution utility model with no competition among DG units is considered. The proposed model positions the DG owner in the outer optimization level and the DisCo in the inner one. This last optimization problem is substituted by its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, turning the bilevel programming problem into an equivalent single-level nonlinear programming problem which is solved using commercially available software.

At the first step, the continuous optimal control theory is used to model and solve the maximum entropy problem for a continuous random variable. The maximum entropy principle provides a method to obtain least-biased Probability Density Function (pdf) estimation. In this paper, to find a closed form solution for the maximum entropy problem with any number of moment constraints, the entropy is considered as a functional measure and the moment constraints are considered as the state equations. Therefore, the pdf estimation problem can be reformulated as the optimal control problem. At the second step, the proposed unbiased pdf estimator is used to estimate the pdf of electricity price. Moreover, the statistical indices and the distributional characteristics of electricity price are analyzed at each load level. The simulation results on the electricity price data of New England, Ontario and Nord Pool electricity markets show the efficiency of the proposed pdf estimator. In addition, the obtained results show that by decreasing the load, the statistical and distributional characteristics of the electricity price inclined toward the statistical properties of the normal distribution.",Electricity price; Maximum entropy (ME); Optimal control; Probability density function (pdf),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This empirical evidence is still in search of a theoretical explanation and this paper contributes to the existing literature by offering both a theoretical discussion and an empirical investigation. The latter is conducted using Italian electricity auction data and shows that bid prices of generators are significantly affected (i.e. moderated) by variables incorporating vertical integration into the econometric model. This is what we call the counterspeculation effect of vertical integration.

In a case study, the framework is applied to a two-settlement electricity market with centralized unit commitment, also considering demand response for energy.

Different scenarios in terms of wind penetration, wind forecasts, and wind curtailment are modeled in order to analyze the impact of wind power on electricity prices for different wind penetration levels and for different levels of wind power visibility and controllability. The analysis concludes that electricity price volatility increases even as electricity prices decrease with increasing wind penetration levels. The impact of wind power on price volatility is larger in the shorter term (5-min compared to hour-to-hour). The results presented show that over-forecasting wind power increases electricity prices while under-forecasting wind power reduces them. The modeling results also show that controlling wind power by allowing curtailment increases electricity prices, and for higher wind penetrations it also reduces their volatility. © 2016.",Electricity price; Production cost modeling; Wind forecasting; Wind power; Wind power curtailment,Costs; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Power control; Wind power; Electricity price volatilities; Electricity prices; Independent system operators; Production cost model; Wind forecasting; Wind penetration; Wind penetration levels; Wind power curtailments; Weather forecasting; cost analysis; electricity; numerical model; production cost; wind power; New England; United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Agurto R., Fuentes F., García C.J., Skoknic E.",The macroeconomic impact of the electricity price: lessons from Chile,2020,,"This article presents the hypothesis that exogenous shocks in the electricity market, through variations in prices that are independent of changes in oil prices, may affect the business cycle of the Chilean economy in the short and medium term. The results of our research confirm this hypothesis: shocks of different signs that modify investment in power generation—delays or new investment in renewable energies—have played an important role in the fluctuation of the business cycle. For example, the comparison of different scenarios reveals that after a few years, delays could have caused losses of around 6.0% of GDP growth, because the price of electricity would have been far from its equilibrium value for a long time. Therefore, without the strong investment in renewables, among other technologies, the delays would have materialized, resulting in relevant costs to the economy. These results have important policy implications. Chile has been a leader in Latin America in terms of electricity market reform since 1982. Therefore, it is essential to study possible changes in the Chilean electricity market, to the extent that it could lead other countries to question the benefits of implementing similar market reforms, especially if negative shocks in the electricity generation sector are not compensated by new investments. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bayesian estimation; Business cycle; Electric energy; Macroeconomics models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stathakis E., Papadimitriou T., Gogas P.",Forecasting price spikes in electricity markets,2020,,"Electricity markets are considered to be the most volatile amongst commodity markets. The non-storability of electricity and the need for instantaneous balancing of demand and supply can often cause extreme short-lived fluctuations in electricity prices. These fluctuations are termed price spikes. In this paper, we employ a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to forecast the occurrence of price spikes in the German intraday electricity market. As price spikes, we define the prices that lie above the 95th quantile estimated by fitting a Generalized Pareto distribution in the innovation distribution of an AR-EGARCH model. The generalization ability of the model is tested in an out-of-the-sample dataset consisting of 4080 hours. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our best SVM model against Neural Networks (NNs) and Gradient Boosted Machines (GBMs). © 2020, Rimini Centre for Economic Analysis.

However, no studies have been reported examining the economic impact of price forecast inaccuracies on forecast users. Therefore, in this paper, the application of electricity market price forecasts to short-term operation scheduling of two typical and inherently different industrial loads is examined and the associated economic impact is analyzed. Using electricity market price forecasts as the expected next-day electricity prices, optimal operating schedules and the associated costs are determined for each load. These costs are compared with those of a ""perfect"" price forecast scenario in which actual prices are used to determine the operating schedules.

"Díaz F.J., Contreras J., Muñoz J.I., Pozo D.",Optimal scheduling of a price-taker cascaded reservoir system in a pool-based electricity market,2011,44.0,"A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for scheduling of the short-term integrated operation of a series of price-taker hydroelectric plants (H-GENCO) along a cascaded reservoir system in a pool-based electricity market is presented. The objective of the H-GENCO can be either to maximize profit, taking into account technical efficiency, or to maximize technical efficiency, maintaining a profit level. In both cases, the efficiency can be accurately obtained using the Hill diagram supplied by turbine manufacturers. A multiple nonlinear regression analysis of the unit's technical efficiency is estimated as a quadratic function of net head and water discharge. Several case studies of realistic dimensions are described, where results indicate that a profit-based MINLP produces better results compared to an MILP model, on the other hand, higher efficiencies and water savings are obtained in the efficiency-based model. © 2010 IEEE.",Hill diagram; hydroelectric generation; net head; technical efficiency; water discharge,Hill diagram; hydroelectric generation; net head; Technical efficiency; water discharge; Electric industry; Integer programming; Lakes; Optimization; Profitability; Regression analysis; Reservoirs (water); Scheduling; Efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rintamäki T., Siddiqui A.S., Salo A.",Does renewable energy generation decrease the volatility of electricity prices? An analysis of Denmark and Germany,2017,43.0,"Although variable renewable energy (VRE) technologies with zero marginal costs decrease electricity prices, the literature is inconclusive about how the resulting shift in the supply curves impacts price volatility. Because the flexibility to respond to high peak and low off-peak prices is crucial for demand-response applications and may compensate for the losses of conventional generators caused by lower average prices, there is a need to understand how the penetration of VRE affects volatility. In this paper, we build distributed lag models with Danish and German data to estimate the impact of VRE generation on electricity price volatility. We find that in Denmark wind power decreases the daily volatility of prices by flattening the hourly price profile, but in Germany it increases the volatility because it has a stronger impact on off-peak prices. Our analysis suggests that access to flexible generation capacity and wind power generation patterns contribute to these differing impacts. Meanwhile, solar power decreases price volatility in Germany. By contrast, the weekly volatility of prices increases in both areas due to the intermittency of VRE. Thus, policy measures for facilitating the integration of VRE should be tailored to such region-specific patterns. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",EEX; Electricity price volatility; Nord Pool; Solar power; Time-series model; Wind power,Electric power generation; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Wind power; Conventional generators; Distributed lag models; Electricity price volatilities; Generation capacity; Nord Pool; Renewable energy generation; Time series modeling; Variable renewable energies; Costs; alternative energy; electricity supply; numerical model; price dynamics; renewable resource; solar power; time series; wind power; Denmark; Germany,Interessant men fokuserer ikke på forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the cost of shore power plays an important role in an economic operation for AESs. In order to fully exploit its potential, a two-stage joint scheduling model is proposed to optimally coordinate the voyage scheduling and power generation of an AES. Different from previous studies which only consider the operation cost of the ship itself, a novel coordinated framework is developed in this paper to address the uncertainty of the real-time electricity price of shore-side electricity to optimize the AES's navigation. A deep learning-based forecasting method is utilized to predict the electricity price of various places for ship operators. Then, a multi-stage hybrid optimization algorithm is designed to solve the proposed multi-objective joint scheduling problem. A navigation route in Australia is used for case studies and simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the forecasting method, the high energy utilization efficiency of the proposed method and the necessity of on-shore power influence on the AES voyage. © 2020 IEEE.",All-electric ship; deep learning; energy storage system; joint generation and voyage scheduling; real-time electricity price prediction,Costs; Deep learning; Electric ship equipment; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Marine power plants; Microgrids; Ships; All electric ships; Economic operations; Electricity prices; Energy utilization efficiency; Forecasting methods; Hybrid optimization algorithm; Navigation routes; Shipboard power system; Scheduling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An analysis of Texas’s wholesale electricity market,2020,,"Using data from Texas’s wholesale electricity market, we investigate the relationship between nodal prices and investment location decisions of utility-scale generation. We find some evidence that new investment arises in areas with recently elevated nodal prices. However, we find no evidence that new generation resources receive a nodal price premium post-entry as projected by the expectation of higher nodal prices. Further, a logit regression analysis suggests that the probability of natural-gas-fired generation investments tends to increase with expected nodal prices in peak hours. However, the estimated relationship is statistically and economically weak and sensitive to model specification. These findings suggest other factors are more important drivers than nodal prices of location decisions for utility-scale generation investments in Texas. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Electricity; Entry; Locational marginal pricing; Regulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we argue that most empirical studies using frontier estimation methods such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) over-estimate MACs. The first methodological contribution of this paper is to clarify the conceptual distinction between the shadow price and MAC in order to analyze three sources of upward bias due to the limited set of abatement options, inefficiency, and noisy data. Our second methodological contribution is to develop a novel MAC estimation approach based on convex quantile regression. Compared to the traditional methods, convex quantile regression is more robust to the choice of the direction vector, random noise, and heteroscedasticity.

"Yang H., Lai M.",Chaotic characteristics of electricity price and its forecasting model,2005,1.0,"In electricity market the price of electricity depends on the joint effect of many factors with its evolving process characterized by very complicated random motion. To reveal the inherent law behind the seemingly random evolving process, first the chaotic feature of electricity price is verified with the chaos theory. The Lyapunov exponents and the fractal dimensions of the attractors are extracted from the phase space reconstructed by the single variable time series of electricity price. Here it can be seen that the electricity price possesses chaotic characteristics, and such a chaotic behavior is further verified by the surrogate data method, providing the basis for performing the short-term forecast of electricity price with the help of the chaos theory. Then a more accurate phase space is reconstructed by the multi-variable time series constituted by the electricity price and its correlated factors, i.e., the system load and the available generating capacity time series. By tracing the evolving trend of the adjacent phase points in the phase space, the global and local electricity price forecasting models based on the recurrent neural network are established, with which the electricity prices in the New England electricity market are successfully predicted. © Institution of Engineers, Australia 2005.",,Chaos theory; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Multivariable systems; Phase control; Random processes; Time series analysis; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Forecasting models; Random motions; Electricity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This can clearly be of interest for the control of large scale systems as they arise in power management issues, and is illustrated with an example of hydro-power application. In short, the coordinator computes a price vector and distributes it to the various subsystems composing the overall system to be controlled, on the basis of the predicted control strategies that each of them communicate to it. The main point is that the coordinator here takes advantage of the explicit solutions for local linear Receding Horizon Controls, to globally update those price values in an explicit way as well.

"Nerves A.C., Bunyi J.E.A.",A no-arbitrage approach to pricing of Flexible Electricity Contracts considering transmission line rentals,2012,1.0,"This study considers the impact of transmission line rentals on the pricing of Flexible Electricity Contracts, which allow flexible scheduling of electric energy, using a no-arbitrage approach. A Flexible Electricity Contract requires the buyer or seller to schedule the amount of energy to be supplied for each time interval. Given stochastic models for spot and line rental prices, this approach determines the optimal price of the Flexible Electricity Contract by determining the opportunities that can be advantageous to the buyer or seller, and setting the price of the contract such that there is no arbitrage. The stochastic spot prices are modeled using autoregressive models. On the other hand, stochastic line rental prices are modeled using simple linear regression, with the spot prices as the predictor variable. Based on the said stochastic models for the spot prices and line rental prices, the optimal contract price is determined using Monte Carlo simulation. Simulations are conducted using spot and line rental price information from the Philippine Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. Analysis performed in this study shows that considering transmission line rentals has a significant impact on the pricing of Flexible Electricity Contracts. Furthermore, this study also considers the impact of daily and hourly scheduling provisions on the contract prices. © 2012 IEEE.",arbitrage; contract pricing; electricity market; flexible electricity contracts; Monte-Carlo simulation; transmission line rental,arbitrage; Contract pricing; Electricity contracts; Electricity market; Monte Carlo Simulation; Electric lines; Electricity; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Planning; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Transmission line theory; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking a multi-agent system modeling approach, this paper presents a conceptual platform for discovering dynamic pricing solutions that reflect the varying cost of electricity in the wholesale market as well as the level of demand participation, especially regarding household customers and small and medium sized businesses. At first, an agent-based meta-model representing various concepts, relations, and structure of agents is constructed. Then a domain model can be instantiated based upon the meta-model. Finally, a simulation experiment is developed for use case demonstration and model validation. The simulation is for the supplier to obtain the profit-maximizing demand curve which has such a shape that it follows the spot price curve in inverse ratio. The result suggests that this multi-agent-based construct could contribute to 1) estimating the impacts of various timevarying tariff options on peak-period energy use through simulation, before any experimental pilots can be carried out; 2) modeling the electricity retail market evolving interactions in a systematic manner; 3) inducing innovative simulation configurations.",Agent-based modeling; Computational intelligence; Demand response; Electricity markets; Meta-model; Multi-agent systems; Real-time pricing; Smart grids,Agent-based model; Demand response; Electricity market; Meta model; Real time pricing; Smart grid; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computational methods; Costs; Information systems; Mathematical models; Multi agent systems; Smart power grids; Computer simulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the uncertain linear system is described as an extended uncertain linear system which consists of monomials about the state, stability of the extened system is analized based on sum of squares.

However, the uncertainty of renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind generator (WG), makes it difficult to predict the output power of these resources. Hence, battery energy storage system (BESS) is being introduced. BESS is very effective equipment because it is possible to prevent the power output variation of renewable energy facilities through the charging and discharging of the BESS.

Hence, determination of the market value of energy generated by power plants using renewable energy sources becomes a particularly significant issue. This market value has to take into account the prevention of costs from the use of fossil fuels, as well as the resulting environmental benefits. Our paper proposes methods for solving this problem, contributing to the increase of economic efficiency of investment projects for the construction of renewable energy facilities and the formation of economic incentives for their propagation in energy supply systems. The proposed methods are based on the dynamic differentiation of tariffs for consumers with renewable energy sources depending on their structure of electricity consumption. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by calculating the cost of electricity for households located in the Krasnodar region using renewable energy sources. It is shown that this approach to the formation of tariffs for consumers allows the household to receive additional savings from the efficient use of energy installations on RES and energy storage devices in terms of alignment of the energy consumption schedule. This creates a significant incentive for households to use them and contributes to increasing the effectiveness of government renewable energy support programs, including by solving the acute problem of raising electricity tariffs from the grid. © 2019 by the authors.

"Faza A., Al-Mousa A.",PSO-based optimization toward intelligent dynamic pricing schemes parameterization,2019,1.0,"Advances in the technologies of smart grids has made it possible to monitor and control the demand side of the power grid in ways that were not possible in the past. Thanks to the advances in information and communication technologies (ICT), Demand Side Management (DSM) is now possible, and promises more efficient and reliable power grids. This paper presents a study of different dynamic pricing techniques that are used as means to shape the demand in ways that minimize generation cost or maximize profit. This is achieved by using a fuzzy logic model that takes into account the different types of customers in the system. The paper further uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to generate the parameters that can achieve optimal grid operation. Results show that when customers are actively engaged in DSM schemes, and with the proper Dynamic Pricing scheme, optimal results can be obtained that benefit both the customers and the utility company, not to mention the savings in energy production and its impact on the sustainability of our cities. The results show that savings up to 12% in generation cost and a three times increase in profit can be achieved using an optimized DSM scheme. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Demand prediction; Demand side management; Fuzzy logic; Particle swarm optimization; Probabilistic model; Real-time pricing,Computer circuits; Demand side management; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Fuzzy logic; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Sales; Smart power grids; Demand prediction; Energy productions; Information and Communication Technologies; Monitor and control; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Probabilistic modeling; Real time pricing; Utility companies; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, energy flexibility is required to cope with the increased share of renewable energy. Utilising it necessitates mathematical models of the operational response of energy flexible consumers. In this paper we present an accurate and general dynamic model of energy flexibility based on stochastic differential equations. The intuitive interpretation of the parameters is explained, to show the generality of the proposed model. To validate the approach, the parameters are estimated for three water towers and three buildings controlled by economic model predictive controllers. The model is then used to offer the energy flexibility on the current electricity market of Scandinavia, Nord Pool, using the so called “flexi orders”. Finally, the energy flexibility is used by controlling the demand of the water towers indirectly, through price signals designed based on the proposed model. Compared to having perfect foresight of electricity prices and future demand, between 63% and 98% of the potential savings were obtained in for these case studies. This shows that even without direct control of energy flexible systems, most of the potential can be reached under the current market conditions. © 2020 The Authors",Demand response; Energy flexibility; Flexibility function; State space model; Stochastic differential equations,Commerce; Differential equations; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Water towers; Electricity prices; Energy flexibility; Non-linear modelling; Perfect foresights; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Response of energy; Stochastic differential equations; Stochastic models; accuracy assessment; alternative energy; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity industry; nonlinearity; parameterization; price dynamics; stochasticity; Scandinavia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Caramanis Michael,INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND LONG-TERM PLANNING UNDER ELECTRICITY SPOT PRICING.,1982,2.0,This paper is a follow-up of previous work on optimal spot pricing of electricity. The issue of long-term planning in the electric utility industry as it relates to the adoption of socially optimal spot pricing is considered. Optimal investment conditions are derived and an algorithm is developed which allows integration of these conditions into long-term planning. The proposed algorithm is an extension of Booth-Baleriaux probabilistic production costing and thus exhibits high computational efficiency. It provides the building block for incorporating spot pricing into mathematical programming methodologies used in generation expansion planning. The algorithm's usefulness to produce optimal spot price forecasts that may induce socially efficient investments in non-utility-owned generation and to facilitate empirical studies on the income distributional impact of spot price implementation is discussed.,,ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS - Planning; COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY; ELECTRICITY SPOT PRICING; INVESTMENT DECISIONS; LONG-TERM PLANNING; OPTIMAL SPOT PRICING; PRODUCTION COSTING; ELECTRIC UTILITIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Muchayi M., El-Hawary M.E.",Method for optimal pricing of electric supply including transmission system considerations,1999,2.0,"Determining real-time electricity rate structures is currently receiving a great deal of attention. In this paper, a strategy for pricing electricity supply is formulated and evaluated. Unlike other methods which use only the variation of fuel cost for generation to estimate the rate structures, the proposed pricing algorithm incorporates the optimal allocation of transmission system operating costs based on time-of-use pricing. The transmission costs are obtained by assigning a price k to each unit of power flow in the network. The assignment does not discriminate between participants located at differing parts of the network. The real-time pricing reflects the instantaneous cost of production and functions as a load management tool because this interacts with consumer behavior. The demand for power flows and transmission on an electricity supply system, like the demand for any bundle of economic goods depends upon the assigned transmission prices, together with the economic benefit to the consumer. It is assumed that there are no privately owned generating plants and that all plants and transmission lines are operated by the utility. The modeling scheme is applied to the IEEE standard 5, 14, 30 and 57 bus power systems and involves solving a modified optimal power flow problem (OPF) iteratively using the MINOS package. It is concluded that the method has a wide potential application in electricity supply pricing.",,Algorithms; Costs; Electric load flow; Electric load management; Electric power transmission; Electric power utilization; Electric rates; Fuels; Electric supply; Fuel costs; Modified optimal power flow problem; Optimal pricing; Transmission system operating costs; Transmission systems considerations; Electric power systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ponce De Leao M.T., Saraiva J.T.",Solving the Revenue Reconciliation Problem of Distribution Network Providers Using Long-Term Marginal Prices,2002,2.0,"We describe an integrated methodology to compute long-term marginal prices in distribution networks. Long-term marginal prices are considered the most interesting and economically sound way of allocating network costs to users. Additionally, they inherently deal with the revenue-reconciliation problem, as they generally do not require other large supplementary tariff terms. The proposed methodology uses fuzzy sets to model uncertainties in load forecasts and considers several criteria to guide the identification of solutions.

"Lu X., Sugianto L.F., Lee V.",Test of asymmetry effect of demand on spot price using MCMC methods,2006,2.0,"Analysing and forecasting spot price has become a task that cannot be overlooked since the deregulation of the electricity market in Australia. There are many factors that affect electricity spot prices. Demand, especially, as one of the fundamental drivers, plays an important role as prices are decided according to the balance of the supply and demand. Financial economists have studied the temporal relationship between price and the trading volume in most commodity markets. The relationship implies the validity of a number of hypotheses, including sequential information arrival hypothesis and the market inefficiency, in the sense that volume can be used to predict future price changes. Such research finding can be used to design trading strategy for market players. Previous studies were either mainly concentrated on price itself or the direct relationship between demand and price, if they incorporate demand into spot price forecasting. In this paper, we attempt to find out whether or not positive and negative changes in demand have the same effect on spot price. As electricity spot prices possess the characteristics of mean-reversion, stochastic volatility and occasional Jumps, we considered a mean-reverting asset pricing model that allows the conditional variance to incorporate log-stochastic volatility and a Poisson-directed jump process. Due to the complexity of the model, conventional estimation methods, such as Ordinary Least Squares, Maximum Likelihood and Quasi Maximum Likelihood, do not suit anymore. To accommodate this, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, combined with Bayesian inference, is chosen to estimate the chosen model. MCMC methods have been reported to outperform the conventional estimation methods especially in estimating asset pricing models with stochastic volatility. The data we used in this study is the peak 30-minute spot price and demand from 2001-2005 in the Victoria region, Australia. The findings should help predict future electricity spot prices and strengthen any trading strategy based on price-demand relationship. © 2006 IEEE.",Asymmetry effect; Bayesian inference; MCMC methods; Price-demand relationship; Stochastic processes; Trading strategy,Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Poisson distribution; Random processes; Asymmetry effects; Bayesian inference; Price-demand relationship; Trading strategies; Costs,3,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vassilopoulos P.,"Price signals in ""Energy-only"" wholesale electricity markets: An empirical analysis of the price signal in France",2010,2.0,"This paper analyzes the price signals of the French wholesale electricity market. We build a model of electricity prices that takes into account several key features of the French electricity market in order to assess the capacity of the price signal to guide investments. Wholesale prices should reflect the imbalances in the generation mix but the signal can be distorted if monopoly rents and/or ""missing money"" are present. We simulate over the 2003-2005 period theoretical perfectly competitive prices with the installed capacity and with the optimal mix to estimate the capacity imbalances and scarcity rents. We then compare the investment signal sent by observed electricity prices and the theoretical prices with the installed capacity. Although there are signs of market conte stability for the mid-merit load, through market integration with the other continental markets, observed prices are too high for the baseload and too low for the peakload, as a result distorting the signal.

"Daneshi H., Srivastava A.K., Daneshi A.",Application of fuzzy logic to priced-based unit commitment under price uncertainty,2010,2.0,This paper proposes a new formulation for the price based unit commitment (PBUC) of electric power generators under a deregulated electricity market. The methodology is developed from the viewpoint of a generating company (GENCO) wishing to maximize its own profit and to hedge its risk as a participant in the market. The problem is expressed as a mixed integer programming (MIP) optimization model in which the expected profit is maximized while the uncertainty of forecasted market price is modeled as a fuzzy variable. The volatility of market price is identified by certain fuzzy definitions pertaining to market volatility. The proposed model can be solved using a standard mixed integer-programming (MIP) solver. Case studies with 36 units are presented in this paper. We study the impact of uncertainty in forecasted parameters in PBUC solution and compare the results with those of crisp PBUC model. © 2010 IEEE.,Fuzzy mixed-integer programming (FMIP); Fuzzy system; Mixed-integer programming (MIP); Priced based unit commitment (PBUC); Unit commitment (UC),Deregulated electricity market; Electric power generators; Expected profits; Fuzzy variable; Generating companies; Market price; Market volatility; Mixed integer; Mixed-integer programming; Optimization models; Price uncertainty; Price-based unit commitments; Priced based unit commitment (PBUC); Unit commitments; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Dynamic programming; Electric generators; Electric load forecasting; Fuzzy sets; Integer programming; Profitability; Fuzzy logic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gutiérrez-Alcaraz G.,Dynamic pricing and area-time specific marginal capacity cost for distribution investment deferment,2011,2.0,"Electricity deregulation makes it more feasible to apply differential rates across customers. Dynamic prices can be used to reflect the changes in marginal energy costs of a power system. Some dynamic pricing pilot projects reveal that dynamic prices can actually reduce or shift electricity usage. However, system-load peaks and local-area load peaks could occur at different times. When both peaks are coincident, two objectives can be achieved simultaneously by applying dynamic pricing: total system demand and local demand reduction. However, when these peaks are non-coincident, local demand requires investment. We propose and extended dynamic pricing scheme by taking area- and time-specific marginal distribution capacity costs into account for addressing locational investment deferral.

"Papler D., Bojnec Š.",Determinants of costs and prices for electricity supply in Slovenia,2012,2.0,"This paper analyzes determinants of costs and real prices for retail electricity supply in Slovenia. We estimate cost and price functions in a retail electricity distribution enterprise in Slovenia by ordinary least square regressions on time series data. We confirm the hypotheses that real costs for electricity supply are positively and significantly associated with the costs for purchases of electric energy from electricity producers/wholesalers and with remuneration costs in electricity distribution enterprises. We did not confirm a negative association between the real costs for retail electricity supply and the proxy variable for electricity market liberalization. Market deregulation and price liberalization with increased competition have caused an initial decline in real consumer prices of electric energy. We found that the real consumer price of electric energy is positively associated with producer/wholesaler prices of electric energy, real wages in electricity distribution enterprises, and real tax expenses in the distribution enterprise, but negatively associated with the variable for electricity market liberalization. The results confirm the crucial role of the transmission of producer/wholesaler prices of electric energy and costs within the distribution enterprises, including labor costs, on the consumer prices of electric energy. © 2012 M.E.

Based indeed in the relaxation and separation of a performance cost function, the coordinator computes a price vector (Lagrange Multiplier) that coordinates the global system while respecting its constraints. This vector is transmitted to the subsystems that use this information for adjusting the control policies according to the global objectives, but without total dependence on the coordinator. In particular, if this information is lost, the system can still be operative because the subsystems control strategies are computed locally. In this frame, a distributed power system is considered as an example, in which it is shown that the proposed technique indeed maintains the system in a stable operation, with the same characteristics as the case of a centralized control solution, as well as robustness under loss of information from the coordinator. © 2014 EUCA.",Decentralized Control; Model Predictive Control for Linear Systems; Power Plants,Costs; Decentralized control; Distributed computer systems; Linear systems; Model predictive control; Power plants; Predictive control systems; Centralized control; Control strategies; Distributed Model predictive Control; Distributed power systems; Handling constraints; Model predictive controllers; Power generation systems; Price-driven coordination; Lagrange multipliers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study is based on long-term cointegration relationships between the gross domestic product and the consumption of electricity in Brazil. The methodology estimates the price for each percentage unit deficit, thereby giving a curve with levels of deficit that can vary from 1% to 100%, in contrast to the current curve of prices in deficit, which is restricted to four levels. Prices in deficit are important parameters exogenous to the chain of models for planning the operation of electric power in Brazil, so the application of this methodology should have a positive impact on the calculation of marginal costs of operation and expansion, as well as on the calculation of the spot price. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"He J., Zhao C., Cai L., Cheng P., Shi L.",Supply and demand in smart grid: A closed-loop pricing strategy,2015,2.0,"How to design a dynamic pricing strategy in smart grid is an important but challenging problem due to the uncertainty of customers' demand and their reaction to the price. Most of the existing pricing strategies depend on the prediction of customers' demand and their reaction to the price, thus are not robust enough due to the prediction which may cause a high cost to the supplier. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop pricing algorithm (CPA), which can largely decrease the cost and result in both costing savings for customers and higher profit for the supplier, and thus achieves a win-win solution. We provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the win-win solution for customers and the supplier. We also prove that CPA can obtain a stable price.

"Arci F., Reilly J., Li P., Curran K., Belatreche A.",Forecasting short-term wholesale prices on the irish single electricity market,2018,2.0,"Electricity markets are different from other markets as electricity generation cannot be easily stored in substantial amounts and to avoid blackouts, the generation of electricity must be balanced with customer demand for it on a second-by-second basis. Customers tend to rely on electricity for day-to-day living and cannot replace it easily so when electricity prices increase, customer demand generally does not reduce significantly in the short-term. As electricity generation and customer demand must be matched perfectly second-by-second, and because generation cannot be stored to a considerable extent, cost bids from generators must be balanced with demand estimates in advance of real-time.

Enhancing its accuracy can be helpful to power systems scheduling. This paper presents how to use partial real-time temperature information in forecasting load power, which is usually done using past load power and temperature data. The partial real-time temperature information means temperature information for only part of the entire prediction time interval. To this end, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is trained using past temperature and load power data in order to forecast load power, where forecasted load power depends on the temperature prediction implicitly. Then, in order to deal with the case where nontrivial temperature prediction errors happen, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network is trained using the past data describing the relation between temperature variation and load power variation. Then, the temperature is measured at the beginning of the prediction time-interval and compensated load forecast is computed by adding the output of the LSTM and that of the MLP whose input is the temperature prediction error. It is shown that the proposed compensation using the real-time temperature information indeed improves performance of load power forecast. This improved load forecast is used to predict system marginal price (SMP). The proposed method is validated using the real temperature and load power data of South Korea. © 2019 by the authors.",Load forecast; LSTM (long short-term memory); MLP (multi-layer perceptron); SMP (system marginal price) forecast,Brain; Deep learning; Electric power plant loads; Information use; Long short-term memory; Load forecast; LSTM (long short-term memory); MLP (multilayer perceptron); Multi layer perceptron; Power systems operation; System marginal price; Temperature information; Temperature prediction; Forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The forecasted amount of future renewable power will not provide enough power production to meet growing demand for renewable energy; although, it will help with modernization of the energy sector and development of renewable technology and innovation. At the same time, the capacity support scheme for renewable energy may adversely affect capacity prices and become an additional burden for industrial consumers, who are already paying the cost of capacity support for conventional power plants, so-called Capacity Delivery Agreements (CDAs). This work assesses the impact of the new capacity based support scheme on capacity and electricity price formation. Modeling results show that the impact of capacity support for renewable energy is small compared to that of capacity support for conventional energy, suggesting that the Russian energy production mix will continue to be dominated by fossil fuel based generation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Capacity market; Electricity price; Renewable support mechanisms; Russian RES policy,Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Industrial plants; Modernization; Capacity markets; Conventional power plants; Electricity prices; Industrial consumers; Renewable energy policy; Renewable energy source; Renewable technology; Support mechanism; Renewable energy resources; electrical power; energy policy; fossil fuel; future prospect; market system; power generation; renewable resource; Russian Federation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cludius J., Forrest S., MacGill I.",Distributional effects of the Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET) through wholesale and retail electricity price impacts,2014,26.0,"The Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET) has spurred significant investment in renewable electricity generation, notably wind power, over the past decade. This paper considers distributional implications of the RET for different energy users. Using time-series regression, we show that the increasing amount of wind energy has placed considerable downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices through the so-called merit order effect. On the other hand, RET costs are passed on to consumers in the form of retail electricity price premiums. Our findings highlight likely significant redistributive transfers between different energy user classes under current RET arrangements. In particular, some energy-intensive industries are benefiting from lower wholesale electricity prices whilst being largely exempted from contributing to the costs of the scheme. By contrast, many households are paying significant RET pass through costs whilst not necessarily benefiting from lower wholesale prices. A more equitable distribution of RET costs and benefits could be achieved by reviewing the scope and extent of industry exemptions and ensuring that methodologies to estimate wholesale price components in regulated electricity tariffs reflect more closely actual market conditions. More generally, these findings support the growing international appreciation that policy makers need to integrate distributional assessments into policy design and implementation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Distributional effects; Electricity market; Renewable energy,Cost benefit analysis; Electricity; Investments; Wind power; Distributional effects; Electricity market; Electricity tariff; Energy intensive industries; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Time-series regression; Wholesale electricity; Costs; alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy use; policy analysis; price dynamics; renewable resource; wind power; Australia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a case study based on the ERCOT power system, we compare the cost of operating the system with forecasts of future wind availability to a best-case scenario with perfect foresight of wind. We demonstrate that wind uncertainty can impose substantive costs on the system and that demand response can eliminate more than 75% of these costs if loads respond to system conditions immediately.

We find substantial asymmetry when retailers pass on the impact of price changes in the wholesale market to the retail prices as price increases are transmitted more quickly than price decreases. By examining the cumulative adjustment function of price change, we identify that some dominant retailers might be exercising market power in the retail electricity market. For an average Norwegian household with variable price contract, the cost of asymmetric price pass-through due to 2.5. Øre/kWh change in the wholesale price over the complete life of pass-through in a year reaches to a high of 2.28 NOK. This cost sums up to 3.8 million NOK for all the Norwegian households on variable price contracts for one time price change. To deal with this asymmetric price setting behavior, end consumers should switch to spot price contracts and make use of ""smart grid"" technologies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Market power; Norwegian electricity market; Price asymmetry; Price pass-through; Transmission lag,Electricity market; End consumers; End users; Market Power; Price asymmetry; Price changes; Price increase; Price pass-through; Price setting; Retail electricity markets; Retail price; Smart grid; Spot price; Whole sale prices; Wholesale electricity; Wholesale markets; Commerce; Consumer behavior; Electric industry; Sales; Costs; asymmetry; consumption behavior; electricity supply; price dynamics; retailing; Norway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cramton P.,Competitive bidding behavior in uniform-price auction markets,2004,24.0,"Profit-maximizing bidding in uniform price auction markets involves bidding above marginal cost. It therefore is not surprising that such behavior is observed in electricity markets. This incentive to bid above marginal cost is not the result of coordinated action among the bidders. Rather, each bidder is independently selecting its bid to maximize profits based on its estimate of the residual demand curve it faces. The supplier bids a price for its energy capacity to optimize its marginal tradeoff between higher prices and lower quantities. Price response from either demand or other suppliers prevents the supplier from raising its bid too much. Profit maximizing bidding should be expected and encouraged by regulators. It is precisely this profit maximizing behavior that guides the market toward long-run efficient outcomes.",,Competition; Electric industry; Electric rates; Marketing; Optimization; Problem solving; Auction markets; Competitive bidding; Energy capacity; Profit maximizing bidding; Industrial economics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kekatos V., Giannakis G.B., Baldick R.",Grid topology identification using electricity prices,2014,23.0,"The potential of recovering the topology of a grid using solely publicly available market data is explored here. In contemporary whole-sale electricity markets, real-time prices are typically determined by solving the network-constrained economic dispatch problem. Under a linear DC model, locational marginal prices (LMPs) correspond to the Lagrange multipliers of the linear program involved. The interesting observation here is that the matrix of spatiotemporally varying LMPs exhibits the following property: Once premultiplied by the weighted grid Laplacian, it yields a low-rank and sparse matrix. Leveraging this rich structure, a regularized maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is developed to recover the grid Laplacian from the LMPs. The convex optimization problem formulated includes low rank-and sparsity-promoting regularizers, and it is solved using a scalable algorithm.

Presented work is an extended version of previous works done by authors to integrate ANN and similar days method for predicting electricity price. Focus here is on sensitivity analysis of similar days parameters while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the PJM (regional transmission organization in north-east America) electricity market. Several cases are simulated by choosing: (a) two; (b) three; (c) four; and (d) five similar days parameters to calculate the norm. Additionally, sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing time framework of similar days (d=15, 30, 45, 60) and number of selected similar price days (N=5, 10). From sensitivity analysis, it is identified that the optimized mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained using case-c with d=30 and N=10. MAPE of reasonably small value along with forecast mean square error (FMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of around 2$/MWh and 1$/MWh are obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price.

Besides improving forecasting, electricity retailers can meet this challenge by partly adopting the demand side of the electricity markets to the fluctuating supply side. The necessary communication infrastructure for this so-called demand side management (DSM) such as dynamic pricing are relatively well understood. However, there is little known about the economic potential of DSM for retailers to reduce price uncertainty in deregulated markets. We present the foundation of a DSM system that targets both diminishing price uncertainty and reducing total expenditures.

"Gómez-Quiles C., Gil H.A.",Inference of electricity price depletion by wind power in Spain,2011,3.0,"Wind power is usually given priority in electricity markets by assigning a zero price to its expected output during the settlement process. The more wind power is to be incorporated into the market, the less number of conventional units of output will be required to supply the demand, resulting in an expected drop in electricity prices. Lower electricity prices are good in the long-term for all entities that buy electricity from the market and sell it back to consumers. When the prices drop to minimum levels, however, (a situation called here as price depletion) the profitability of some conventional generators necessary for the supply adequacy of the system in times of low wind power production may get compromised. This work uses a probabilistic model to estimate the role that wind power is playing in the price depletion situations sometimes observed in Spain. Evidence shows that it is a balanced combination of factors what leads to this circumstance. © 2011 IEEE.",Electricity Markets; Prices; Wind Power,Electricity market; Electricity prices; Prices; Probabilistic models; Supply adequacy; Wind power production; Commerce; Drops; Electric utilities; Electricity; Profitability; Wind power; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firstly, an individual TCL model on account of consumer behaviors is developed to characterize the impact of fluctuated electricity prices and different thermal comfort requirements. Secondly, a novel optimization model of heterogeneous TCLs, which can guarantee consumer satisfaction, is proposed to provide operating reserve for power systems. Thirdly, the probability density estimation (PDE) method is developed to evaluate the ORC provided by large-scale heterogeneous TCLs with insufficient data.

Under this pricing mechanism, electricity is priced at the exanté price (calculated based on predicted demand) up to the amount consumed at the previous time period. Any deviation of the demand from the previous time period is penalized or reimbursed at the ex-post price (calculated based on actual demand, after consumption). It is assumed that the exanté and ex-post prices are calculated based on the aggregate consumption of the population. Therefore, although an individual consumer is a price-taker, he might adjust his behavior strategically based on the mean consumption of the population. Within this class of pricing mechanisms we investigate the social welfare and price stability properties. Simulation is used to show that the approximate dynamics with individual-mass interaction has better stability and robustness properties than pure exanté pricing. © 2011 IEEE.",Economic Efficiency; Market Stability; Real-Time Pricing,Aggregate consumption; Competitive electricity markets; Economic efficiency; Market stability; New model; Price stability; Pricing mechanism; Pricing models; Real time pricing; Social welfare; Stability and robustness; Time-periods; Closed loop systems; Commerce; Large scale systems; Stability; Costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The choice of the underlying process is crucial for the simulation outcome. For power plants the core question is the existence of stable long-term cointegration relations. Therefore we investigate the impacts of different ways to model price movements in a portfolio selection model for the German electricity market. Three different approaches of modelling fuel prices are compared: initially, all prices are modelled as correlated random walks. Thereafter the coal price is modelled as random walk. The gas price follows the coal price through a mean-reversion process. Lastly, all prices are modelled as mean reversion processes with correlated residuals. The prices of electricity base and peak futures are simulated using historical correlations with gas and coal prices. Yearly base and peak prices are transformed into an estimated price duration curve followed by the steps power plant dispatch, operational margin and net present value calculation and finally the portfolio selection.

"Abdullah M.P., Nazar N.S.M., Hassan M.Y., Hussin F.",Optimizing time of use (ToU) electricity pricing in regulated market,2016,4.0,"Time-of-Use (ToU) electricity price for residential consumers is receiving lots of attention lately with the increment of smart meters usage among residential customers. ToU prices reflect the actual electricity cost and the rate is commonly set base on market price of electricity. Implementing ToU pricing system on a regulated electricity system such as in Malaysia is complicated due to non existence of electricity market. The electrical utility company or the regulator will need to determine the optimum ToU prices that would give the correct price signal so that customers will react accordingly. Many factors need to be considered such as impact on electricity generation cost, load profile, load elasticity and customers’ satisfaction. This paper presents an optimization method to estimate the optimum ToU prices for given electricity demand profile and demand elasticity. The presented method able to reduce the gap between peak and off-peak demand and ensure the estimated ToU prices are fairly proportionate among hours i.e. summation of rate increments (from the fixed price) is equal to the summation of rate decrements. A simple system is used as a case study to demonstrate the application of the optimization method presented. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

"Clements A.E., Hurn A.S., Li Z.",The effect of transmission constraints on electricity prices,2017,4.0,"Electricity prices in an interconnected market are influenced by the occurrence of transmission constraints. Until relatively recently, however, the important effects of transmission constraints on both the trajectory and volatility of electricity prices have not played a large role in empirical models of prices. This paper explores the contribution to price volatility in the Queensland electricity market made by transmission constraints. It is found that robust estimation techniques are necessary to guard against incorrect inference in time series models using electricity price data in which severe price spikes occur. The main empirical lesson is that transmission constraints contribute significantly both to the level and variability of price and consequently the performance of a price forecasting model is likely to be improved by incorporating information on transmission constraints. While the general tenor of this conclusion will come as no surprise, the extent and the importance of these effects found in this paper for forecasting price and for computing summary measures like Value-at-Risk serve as a timely reminder to practitioners. © 2017 by the IAEE.",Price spikes; Regional electricity prices; Transmission constraints,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ferdous J., Mollah M.P., Razzaque M.A., Hassan M.M., Alamri A., Fortino G., Zhou M.",Optimal Dynamic Pricing for Trading-Off User Utility and Operator Profit in Smart Grid,2020,4.0,"A conventional power grid is criticized by its poor capability of power usage management, especially in handling dynamically varying power demands over time. The concept of smart grid has been introduced to mitigate this problem by satisfying not only real-time power demands, but also by restricting power usage within the capacity. Its consistent outperformance and new perspective in computer intelligence to control the grid for autonomous power consumption has been gradually replacing the conventional power grid. However, even in smart grid, providing high satisfaction to users often leads smart grid operator (SGO) to loss and vice versa. In this paper, we develop an optimal dynamic pricing mechanism for trading-off (ODPT), for SGOs that tradeoff between user utility and operator profit in smart grid systems. It allows the operator to purchase power from multiple energy producers and to set selling price to users dynamically following the demand-supply theory of economics. It also exploits an artificial neural network model to more accurately predict the power usage. The simulation results, carried out on a commercially available optimization modeling tool using practical power usage data, prove the effectiveness of the proposed ODPT in increasing the operator profit while satisfying user demands. © 2013 IEEE.",Dynamic power pricing; Internet of Things (IoT); operator profit; smart grid; smart grid operator (SGO); user utility,Costs; Data structures; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Green computing; Interactive computer systems; Internet of things; Neural networks; Optimization; Production; Profitability; Real time systems; Dynamic power pricing; Internet of Things (IOT); Power demands; Predictive models; Smart grid; User utility; Smart power grids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Qiu Z.-W.,Mutivariable mutual information based feature selection for electricity price forecasting,2012,5.0,"In a competitive electricity market, the electricity price forecasting provides a useful information for suppliers to develop bidding strategies or to make investment decisions. Customers can also be benefit by scheduling their electricity consumption according to the electricity price. Selecting proper and useful features plays an essential role in improving the forecasting accuracy. In this paper, multivariable mutual information is applied for feature selection to select the more relation between the output price and the candidate input features. Support vector regression (SVR) is applied as the regression system. Experimental results show that the SVR with the proposed feature selection achieves more accurate prediction than ones with other well-known feature selection methods. © 2012 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Feature selection; Multivariable mutual information; Support vector regression,Accurate prediction; Bidding strategy; Competitive electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity-consumption; Feature selection methods; Forecasting accuracy; Input features; Investment decisions; Multi variables; Mutual informations; Output price; Support vector regression (SVR); Cybernetics; Electric load forecasting; Feature extraction; Investments; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Multivariable systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le Coq C., Orzen H., Schwenen S.",Pricing and capacity provision in electricity markets: an experimental study,2017,5.0,"The creation of adequate investment incentives has been of great concern in the restructuring of the electricity sector. However, to achieve this, regulators have applied different market designs across countries and regions. In this paper we employ laboratory methods to explore the relationship between market design, capacity provision and pricing in electricity markets. Subjects act as firms, choosing their generation capacity and competing in uniform price auction markets. We compare three regulatory designs: (1) a baseline price cap system that restricts scarcity rents, (2) a price spike regime that effectively lifts these restrictions, and (3) a capacity market that directly rewards the provision of capacity. Restricting price spikes leads to underinvestment. In line with the regulatory intention both alternative designs lead to sufficient investment albeit at the cost of higher energy prices during peak periods and substantial capacity payments in the capacity market regime. To some extent these results confirm theoretical expectations. However, we also find lower than predicted spot market prices as sellers compete relatively intensely in capacities and prices, and the capacity markets are less competitive than predicted. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Auctions; Electricity; Price caps; Supply function competition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mount T., Oh H.",On the first price spike in summer,2004,6.0,"The objective of this paper is to determine why price spikes occur in deregulated wholesale markes for electricity, and how effectively they can be mitigated by different modifications to the market.. The analysis employs a multi-agent system (MAS) to replicate a spot market with six supply firms, represented by adaptive autonomous agents,. These firms submit offers to maximize their own expected profits, and an Independent System Operator (ISO) clears the market for a predetermined load in a uniform price auction. The firms learn about the market and the behavior of their competitors by comparing actual market outcomes with predicted outcomes based on an estimate of their own residual demand curve. This estimated demand curve is updated each period using a Kalman filter. The main results for creating price spikes are 1) uncertainty about the system load is an important determinant of observed behavior (i.e. offer curves shaped like a hockey stick) that is replicated in the MAS, and 2) all firms eventually become speculators, and it is unrealistic to expect firms to behave like price takers in a market with six suppliers. The main results for mitigating high prices are 1) it is impractical to rely on more suppliers, vertically integrated firms, capacity payments or fixed contracts for power to eliminate speculative behavior, and 2) price responsive load is an effective way to mitigate high prices, particularly if some load responds at relatively low prices. Overall, the results show that a MAS can be used to evaluate a wide range of policy options and supplement the results of market tests using human subjects.",,Automatic mitigation procedures (AMP); Electricity markets; Independent system operators (ISO); Litigation; Computer simulation; Costs; Deregulation; Electric loads; Estimation; Industrial economics; Kalman filtering; Multi agent systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the electricity generated from renewable energies (RES-E) is physically integrated into the electricity market and can influence electricity prices. This paper presents the impact of the liberalization process in the Spanish electricity market and the impact of RES-E on household electricity prices.However, as the electricity market liberalization is relatively recent, the related data is limited, and even when trying to estimate the electricity price models through regression procedures a dimensionality problem presents itself. Therefore, in this paper a Maximum Entropy Econometric approach is used that allows for the estimation of models when information is limited. The obtained results suggest that the use of wind energy in electricity generation can contribute to the reduction of electricity prices. However, the electricity generated from hard coal increases the electricity prices.

Breipohl A.M.,Electricity price forecasting models,2002,17.0,"This paper proposes that the price of electricity should be parsed into two components: energy price and ""reliability price"". From the supply point of view, in addition to the energy price, there is a cost associated with reliability, or continuity of supply. This cost, which differs from other commodities, arises because electricity cannot be stored. From the demand point of view for some customers electricity is an essential commodity, while other customers may want a choice of how much reliability they are willing to pay for. If customers have the options of interruptible rates or curtailable rates, or perhaps the option of limiting demand upon receipt of a signal from the control center, then they can consume energy but not reliability, or they can only partially consume reliability. Furthermore suppliers can reduce supply costs if they can reduce demand. In the long term reduced demand reduces the need for generation capacity. Over the short term, demand reduction that is under the control of the dispatch center can reduce the demand for ancillary services.",,Customer satisfaction; Electric power systems; Electricity; Reliability; Energy prices; Electric industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of wind power and potential impacts on system costs is of interest to power system planners and policy makers globally. However, the impact of wind generation on system costs has been only studied with limited actual data from power systems with increased wind penetration. The paper uses a unique dataset of half-hourly system demand, generation, forecast and actual wind generation, along with Irish system marginal price (SMP) data from 2008 to autumn 2012. An econometric time-series model of SMP as a function of forecast and realized demand and wind generation yields results which suggest that each 1% increase in wind generation reduces SMP in Ireland by about 0.06%, while each 1% wind forecast error increases SMP about 0.02%. In absolute terms, though, at the mean the impact of wind forecast errors is small, or about 0.4€cent/MWh-wind generated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Cost function; Econometrics; Power generation economics; Power system economics; Wind power generation,Wind power; Econometrics; Energy prices; Ireland; Power generation economics; Power system economics; Wind forecasts; Wind generation; Cost functions; cost analysis; econometrics; energy planning; error analysis; forecasting method; power generation; price determination; renewable resource; wind power; Ireland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bi S., Zhang Y.J.",False-data injection attack to control real-time price in electricity market,2013,16.0,"The normal operation of electricity market requires accurate state estimation of the power grids. However, recent research shows that carefully synthesized false-data injection attacks can easily introduce errors to state estimates without being detected by the current security systems. In this paper, we analyze and formulate an effective false-data injection attack to control real-time electricity price at any tagged bus. It is observed that an adversary capable of false-data injection attack can induce false real-time electricity price by fabricating biased transmission congestion pattern. From the strategic level, we propose a simple algorithm that finds the effective congestion pattern with minor distortion to the normal system operation. For practical implementation, load redistribution attack, a special false-data injection attack which produces biased load estimates, is used to achieve the derived congestion pattern. We also propose a cost-aware neighborhood load redistribution attack, which only compromises limited measurements around the tagged bus. From theory to practice, our results here reveal the potential cyber vulnerabilities of current electricity market and would help to build more secure smart power grid in the future. © 2013 IEEE.",,Communication; Costs; Electric industry; Smart power grids; State estimation; Cyber vulnerabilities; Electricity market; Electricity prices; False-data injection attacks; Load redistribution; Normal operations; Recent researches; Transmission congestion; Security of data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the important issues in this context is how to charge the users for the use of transmission facilities in the fair way and at the same time allowing the transmission utilities to recover their transmission costs. Several methodologies have been developed to recover the cost of transmission services and to estimate the power contributed by single generating unit in lines and loads. Both developed methods attempt to allocate the charge of the use of the transmission system. This paper describes certain aspects to be considered in pricing the unbundled transmission services. These aspects cover the type of transmission services, the costs related to the services and the methods used to calculate the costs of transmission services. This paper also proposes a new approach to allocate the costs of the transmission services among the transmission user utilising the properties of MW-mile based method. A case study based on a 6-bus system is used to highlight the merit of the proposed approach over the existing approaches. The case study results show that the proposed approach provides a better economic signal in allocating the charges to the transmission user. © 2006 IEEE.",Deregulation; MW-mile method; Postage stamp method and locational charges; Transmission services,Deregulation; Electric power transmission; Fees and charges; Finance; Recovery; Transmissions; (PL) properties; 6 bus system; case studies; Deregulated environments; Electricity markets; Generating units; International (CO); Key factors; MW mile; new approaches; transmission costs; Transmission facilities; Transmission network; Transmission services; Transmission systems; Cost benefit analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kury T.J.,Price effects of independent transmission system operators in the United States electricity market,2013,7.0,"In 1996, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) sought to ""remove impediments to competition in the wholesale bulk power marketplace and to bring more efficient, lower cost power to the Nation's electricity consumers"" through a series of market rules. A product of these rules was the establishment of regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) charged with facilitating equal access to the transmission grid for electricity suppliers. Whether these changes in market structure have succeeded in achieving FERC's goal to provide ""lower cost power to the Nation's electricity consumers"" remains an open question. This paper utilizes a panel data set of the 48 contiguous United States and a treatment effects model in first differences to determine whether there have been changes in delivered electric prices as a result of the establishment of ISOs and RTOs. To avoid the confounding effects of electric restructuring, the model is estimated with the full panel data set, and then again without the states that have restructured their electric markets. This estimation shows that electricity prices fall approximately 4. 8 % in the first 2 years of an ISO's operation and that this result is statistically significant. However, this result is dependent on the presence of states that restructured their electricity markets. When these restructured states are removed from the data set the price effects of RTOs become indistinguishable from zero. The paper concludes that rate agreements are the principal source of the observed decrease in prices and that RTOs have not had the desired effect on electricity prices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Electricity market reform; Electricity market structure; Regional transmission organizations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The market participants are modelled as price-elastic units, price-inelastic units, and storage operators. The distributed control algorithm determines prices over a time horizon through a negotiation procedure in order to maximize social welfare while satisfying network constraints. A simple flow allocation method is used to assign responsibility for constraint violations on the network to individual units and a control rule is then used to adjust nodal prices accordingly. Such a framework is appropriate for the inclusion of aggregated household appliances or other 'virtual' market participants realized through smart grid infrastructure. Results are examined in detail for a 4-bus network and then success is demonstrated for a densely-populated 39-bus network.

The regulatory authority in Great Britain, however, believed that sometimes electricity prices were significantly higher than what was expected and, therefore, introduced price-cap regulation and divestment series. In this study, I analyze how the introduced institutional changes and regulatory reforms affected the dynamics of daily electricity prices in the England and Wales wholesale electricity market during 1990-2001.This research finds that the introduction of price-cap regulation did achieve the goal of lowering the price level at the cost of higher price volatility. Later, the first series of divestments is found to be successful at lowering price volatility, which however happens at the cost of a higher price level. Finally, this study also documents that the second series of divestments was more successful at lowering both the price level and volatility. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Conditional volatility; Electricity prices; Regulation,Conditional volatility; Electricity prices; Institutional change; Liberalized electricity market; Price cap regulation; Regulation; Regulatory authorities; Wholesale electricity markets; Electric industry; Electricity; Costs; electricity supply; institutional framework; liberalization; price dynamics; reform process; regulatory framework; England; United Kingdom; Wales,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any prediction errors may result in higher costs to the supplier. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel, practical closed-loop pricing algorithm (PCPA). Using the closed-loop control to well coordinate the customers and the supplier, the power system can run more efficiently, resulting in both cost saving for customers and higher profit for the supplier. We prove the convergence of PCPA, i.e., a stable price can be achieved. We provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the win-win solution for both the customers and the supplier, and an upper bound of the gain. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition of that the highest win for both the customers and the supplier can be achieved. Extensive simulations have shown that PCPA can outperform the existing prediction-based pricing algorithms. It shows that the profit gain of the proposed algorithm can up to 100% when the total demand can be fixed to the optimal demand. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Closed-loop control; Demand and supply; Pricing algorithm; Smart grid; Win-win solution,Costs; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Profitability; Sales; Smart power grids; Closed-loop control; Demand and supply; Pricing algorithm; Smart grid; Win-win solutions; Closed loop control systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use both high frequency (30-min) and daily datasets for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). We estimate autoregressive distributed lag models (ARDL) to decompose the merit order effect of wind and utility-scale solar PV generation over time and across states. We find that an extra GW of dispatched wind capacity decreases the wholesale electricity price by 11 AUD/MWh at the time of generation, while solar capacity by 14 AUD/MWh. The daily merit order effect is lower. We show that the wind merit order effect has been increasing as a function of dispatched wind capacity over time. Despite of this, wholesale electricity prices in Australia have been increasing, predominantly driven by the increase in natural gas prices.

IEEE 30-bus system is used to test the new model. Some comparisons with other methods are done, and the sensitivity with respect to the uncertain set is analyzed. Comparing with the existed uncertain self-scheduling approaches, the new method has twofold characteristics. First, it does not need a prediction of distribution of random variables and just requires an estimated value and the uncertain set of power price. Second, the counterpart of RO corresponding to the self-scheduling is a simple quadratic or quadratic cone programming.

The market mechanism is described by a feedback system, in which the independent system operator (ISO) interacts with generation companies (GenCOs) via proposing and responding to real-time nodal prices. The linear constrained quadratic optimal tracking problem is formulated; and the solution (nodal price sequence) is repeatedly computed by fusing the recently available information with backward manner and updated over the receding preview horizon. So that the total supply dynamically tracks the demand, the price is stationarized and each GenCO gains the maximal profit for the given price. Numeric results on a 118-bus network validate IFPC's effectiveness and flexibility on incorporating various line rating constraints as well as wind power fluctuation uncertainties. Comparative study demonstrates that IFPC outperforms the negotiated predictive dispatch but elapsing heavier computations. The irrational behavior analysis verifies the convergence to equilibrium; and speculation behavior of GenCOs in the real market is also discussed.

"Shrestha G.B., Songbo Q.",Analysis of electricity price in competitive markets a study in Singapore market,2008,9.0,"Market participants have to deal with constantly changing electricity price in competitive electricity markets in the course of their everyday system operation. Although these prices in a particular market do exhibit some characteristics they are stochastic in nature and the prices cannot be predicted or forecasted for an individual hour. Yet, reasonable predictions or representations of such prices are very crucial for the operations of many market participants, such as Gencos. Many studies have adopted suitable statistical representation of the price in order to carry out system operation problems. However, justification for such models on the basis of real market prices is rarely found. This paper presents the initial findings of the study conducted to characterize the statistical behavior of electricity price in competitive markets. The published electricity prices from Singapore market have been used in these studies. The preliminary analysis is carried out using the price data from the first three years after the introduction deregulation in the market. It is used to identify the general behavior of the mean values of electricity price which show that it is possible to establish reasonable relationship between the market price and many system related factors. Recent historical data from the same market are used to investigate the statistical nature of the electricity price.

It investigates the California electricity market (zone SP15) for selected trading hours using data from January 8, 2013 to September 24, 2016. The approach quantifies a non-linear relationship between the fundamentals and electricity prices, just as predicted by the merit order curve. Natural gas, greenhouse gas allowance prices and load all have a positive effect on electricity prices, with the effect increasing with the quantiles. In contrast, solar production and wind production both have a negative effect on electricity prices. The effect of solar production increases with quantiles, whereas the effect of wind production decreases with quantiles. This paper also includes a stress testing case study in which a producer faces the risk of high solar and wind production, and investigates the effect on the lower tail of the price distribution. Overall, the results demonstrate how the proposed approach can be a helpful risk management tool for participants in the electricity market. © 2020 The Author(s)",California electricity market; Quantile regression; Risk management,Costs; Electric industry; Greenhouse gases; Power markets; Risk management; Electricity prices; Non-linear relationships; Price scenarios; Quantile regression; Solar and winds; Solar production; Stress Testing; Supply and demand; Greenhouse effect; electricity; energy market; performance assessment; regression analysis; scenario analysis; testing method; California; United States,4,2,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jasiński T.,Use of new variables based on air temperature for forecasting day-ahead spot electricity prices using deep neural networks: A new approach,2020,,"The paper presents a way of creating three new, innovative variables based on air temperature to be used in forecasts of electricity demand and prices. The forecasting methods developed so far, especially in the area of energy prices, either did not use temperature data or were based on data that had not undergone pre-processing, which made it difficult for the model to use their potential. Newly developed variables have a linear relationship with the demand for electricity. This paper describes in detail the procedure for determining the parameters of new variables using the electricity market in Poland (a country in Central Europe) as a case study. The proposed approach allows both to avoid data clustering into different seasons and to precisely determine the temperatures at which the nature of the dependence with the demand for electricity changes. The validity of the proposed new variables in prognostic models has been confirmed by their use in deep neural networks. The proposed approach allows reducing the sMAPE by up to 15.3%. The designed new explanatory variables can be used not only in models based on artificial intelligence tools, but also in other forecasting methods that allow the use of exogenous inputs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Air temperature-based variable; Artificial neural network; Electricity price; Forecasting,Atmospheric temperature; Clustering algorithms; Costs; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Neural networks; Artificial intelligence tools; Electricity demands; Explanatory variables; Forecasting methods; Linear relationships; Prognostic model; Spot electricity prices; Temperature data; Power markets; air temperature; artificial neural network; computer simulation; demand-side management; electricity supply; energy planning; forecasting method; price determination; Poland [Central Europe],5,2,1,1,"LIKER DENNE, men den er vel for off-topic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ghasemi-Marzbali A.,"A developed short-term electricity price and load forecasting method based on data processing, support vector machine, and virus colony search",2020,,"Surely, electricity market participants need an accurate estimate for the price and load signals to properly manage their programs to increase their profits. Regarding the two-way interaction between suppliers and consumers, they are able to manage their required profile. Therefore, the individual price or load forecasting is not acceptable and cannot capture their related pattern. Therefore, this paper presents a new forecasting method for price and load signals in simultaneous configuration. This method consists of three main parts: the first part proposes two data preprocessing methods based on wavelet transform to remove noisy term and mutual information to select best features with maximum relevancy and minimum redundancy. The second part suggests a learning engine based on a least square support vector machine (LSSVM) with self-adaptive kernel functions and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) time series to extract the linear and nonlinear patterns. Finally, the last part employs a new modified virus colony search algorithm (VCS) to efficiently set the LSSVM control parameters to use its all capacity. Simulations are carried out for three well-known Australia’s, New York’s, and Ontario’s electricity markets.

We work with off-peak and peak time series from the German-Austrian day-ahead price; hence, we analyze bivariate data. We first estimate the mean of the two time series, and then in a second step we estimate the residuals. The mean equation is estimated by ordinary least squares and the elastic net, and the residuals are estimated by maximum likelihood. Our contribution is to include a bivariate jump component in a mean reverting jump diffusion model in the residuals. The models’ forecasts are evaluated with use of four different criteria, including the energy score to measure whether the correlation structure between the time series is properly included. It is observed that the models with bivariate jumps provide better results with the energy score, which means that it is important to consider this structure to properly forecast correlated time series. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters",Bivariate Bernoulli; Dependency structure; Elastic net estimation; Electricity price forecasting; Energy score; Ensemble forecasting; Forecasting evaluation; GARCH; Jump diffusion process; Pinball score,,"3, 4",2,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fang X., Cui M.",Analytical model of day-ahead and real-time price correlation in strategic wind power offering,2020,,"In this paper, the model of strategic wind power offering in the day-ahead (DA) market is proposed considering the uncertainties of wind power production, and price forecasting of DA and real-time (RT) market. The wind power deviation in the RT market is settled with the two-price mechanism based on the deviation direction and the relation between the locational marginal prices (LMPs) of DA and RT. Instead of using the point forecasting for the DA and RT LMPs, the uncertainties of LMP forecasting are modeled. In addition, the correlation between the forecasting errors of DA and RT LMP are directly modeled instead of generating the correlated scenarios. Finally, the opitmal offered quantity of wind power in the DA market is derived using the probability theory based on the probabilistic wind power forecasting. The case study using the price data of actual DA and RT from Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) validates the effectiveness of the proposed model. It shows that the correlation of the forecasting errors of DA and RT LMP has a significant impact on the wind power quantity offered by DA and revenue results. © 2020, Springer.

The main aim of this study is to comparatively examine the wind generation forecasts in Poland and Portugal, as well as to verify their influence on the day-ahead market prices. The statistical analysis revealed significant deviations of the forecasted and actual wind production in both countries, which referred to the corresponding spot and balancing prices caused considerable financial losses by the wind energy suppliers.

The results have shown that the usability of the information of forecasted wind generation is not unequivocal in models developed for spot prices in Poland, mainly because of the randomness and volatility of recorded wind generation forecasts.

"Naumzik C., Feuerriegel S.",Forecasting electricity prices with machine learning: predictor sensitivity,2020,,"Purpose: Trading on electricity markets occurs such that the price settlement takes place before delivery, often day-ahead. In practice, these prices are highly volatile as they largely depend upon a range of variables such as electricity demand and the feed-in from renewable energy sources. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to provide accurate forecasts. Design/methodology/approach: This paper aims at comparing different predictors stemming from supply-side (solar and wind power generation), demand-side, fuel-related and economic influences. For this reason, this paper implements a broad range of non-linear models from machine learning and draw upon the information-fusion-based sensitivity analysis. Findings: This study disentangles the respective relevance of each predictor. This study shows that external predictors altogether decrease root mean squared errors by up to 21.96%. A Diebold-Mariano test statistically proves that the forecasting accuracy of the proposed machine learning models is superior. Research limitations/implications: The performance gain from including more predictors might be larger than from a better model. Future research should place attention on expanding the data basis in electricity price forecasting. Practical implications: When developing pricing models, practitioners can achieve reasonable performance with a simple model (e.g. seasonal-autoregressive moving-average) that is built upon a wide range of predictors.

However the electricity price time-series is generally infested with extreme values due to high price volatility. This paper discusses the impact of outlier filtering on forecasting accuracy based on a recently introduced seasonal component autoregressive model. We consider such methods of outlier detection (with a priori defined cut-off parameter) as threshold, standard deviation, percentage, recursive, and moving filter on prices. It is shown that such data pre-processing often leads to the forecasting accuracy gain while the error decrease (relative to the approach without filtering) in a number of cases may reach 1.8–1.9% of the average weekly price (in absolute values). For an a priori defined cut-off parameter, the simple threshold and standard deviation filter on prices outperform other considered methods, and yield to the accuracy gain in 63% and 67% of cases, correspondingly. At the same time, in case of the out-of-sample filter parameter grid-optimization all of the methods demonstrate comparable prediction power (equal to the marginal performance). But, practically speaking, such optimization is time-consuming and cannot be carried out on unavailable future data. As an competitive alternative, we propose a combined filter on prices based on a committee machine which uses the results of individual non-optimized algorithms and is not time-consuming, but gives accuracy comparable to the best one obtained for each of the studied electricity markets and leads to forecast gain in 63% of the considered cases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Committee machine; Electricity price forecasting; Long-term trend-seasonal component; Model confidence set; Outlier filtering,Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Forecasting; Statistics; Auto regressive models; Committee machines; Day-ahead power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Long-term trend; Optimized algorithms; Standard deviation; Power markets; accuracy assessment; algorithm; economic conditions; electricity; energy market; optimization; price determination,"4, 5",1,1,1,"Egentlig ganske najs papper på hvordan outliers påvirker forecasting, men fokuserer vel mye på det istedet for P",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Automated negotiation plays a crucial role in the decision support for energy transactions due to the constant need for players to engage in bilateral negotiations. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate bilateral contract prices, which is essential to support market players in their decisions, enabling adequate risk management of the negotiation process. The proposed approach uses an adaptation of the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm to choose the best from a set of possible contract prices forecasts that are determined using several methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), among others. The learning process assesses the probability of success of each forecasting method, by comparing the expected negotiation price with the historic data contracts of competitor players. The negotiation scenario identified as the most probable scenario that the player will face during the negotiation process is the one that presents the higher expected utility value.

"Perez-Mora N., Alomar M.L., Martinez-Moll V.",Spanish energy market: Overview towards price forecast,2018,1,"This paper aims to give an overview of the Spanish Electric Market. This energy market is liberalized and complex due the new and modified rules along time. Due these circumstances the hourly energy prices may vary tremendously. The goal of this work is to analyze in detail the generation technologies, their strategies and energy mix to gain awareness and knowledge to evaluate energy price fluctuations. Two methods are used to forecast in different time horizons: ARIMAX and NARX. Both methods are homologous, using historical energy prices and optionally an explanatory variable. Three options are studied: No explanatory, energy demand and competitive market. Once the models are developed and trained, the results achieved are helpful to understand further changes in the market.

This method has proven effective in predicting market indices in the short-term. However, little attention has been paid to demonstrating search activity for keywords that best grab investor attention in different markets. This study attempts to build the best practically possible proxy for attention in the market for energy commodities using Google search data. Specifically, we confirm the utility of Google search activity for energy related keywords are significant predictors of volatility by showing they have incremental predictive power beyond the conventional GARCH models in predicting volatility for energy commodities' prices. Starting with a set of ninety terms used in the energy sector, the study uses a multistage filtering process to create combinations of keywords that best predict the volatility of crude oil (Brent and West Texas Intermediate), conventional gasoline (New York Harbor and US Gulf Coast), heating oil (New York Harbor), and natural gas prices. For each commodity, combinations that enhance GARCH most effectively are established as proxies of attention. The results indicate investor attention is widely reflected in Internet search activities and demonstrate search data for what keywords best reveal the direction of concern and attention in energy markets. © 2017",Energy market; Energy price volatility; Google search activity; Volatility prediction,Commerce; Costs; Crude oil; Filtration; Forecasting; Information retrieval; Investments; Natural gas; Power markets; Conventional gasoline; Energy markets; Energy price volatilities; Internet searches; Multistage filtering; Natural gas price; Search activity; West texas intermediates; Search engines,4,1,−1,1,"Dette hadde vært fett å få til å bruke, antakeligvis mye å hente på spikes her",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed time series model is suitable to quantify the impact of wind and solar forecasting errors. Due to the considered threshold specification assymetric dependency structures can be captured as well. Additionally it describes well the autoregressive and seasonal effects of intraday electricity prices such as the relationship to day-ahead electricity prices. The methodology is applied to the German intraday market and includes the dependence of the German/Austrian EPEX and EXAA day-ahead markets. Moreover, we discuss the evidence of time-varying and asymmetric effects of wind and solar power forecasting errors. Our findings show that given the considered modeling framework there is no statistically significant evidence that positive wind or solar forecasting errors have a different impact on intraday electricity prices than negative ones. © 2017 IEEE.",,Commerce; Costs; Errors; Forecasting; Solar energy; Asymmetric effects; Dependency structures; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Regression-based model; Renewable energies; Time series modeling; Wind and solar power; Power markets,4,1,1,0,"Igjen, interessant å se hvor viktig vind er, men ikke fokus på P",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is partially due to an increasing share of renewable energy, wind and photovoltaic, which requires power generators to balance out the forecasting errors in their production. We investigate the bidding behaviour in the intraday market by looking at both last prices and continuous bidding, in the context of a reduced-form econometric analysis. A unique data set of 15-minute intraday prices and intraday-updated forecasts of wind and photovoltaic has been employed. Price bids are explained by prior information on renewables forecasts and demand/supply market-specific exogenous variables. We show that intraday prices adjust asymmetrically to both forecasting errors in renewables and to the volume of trades dependent on the threshold variable demand quote, which reflects the expected demand covered by the planned traditional capacity in the day-ahead market. The location of the threshold can be used by market participants to adjust their bids accordingly, given the latest updates in the wind and photovoltaic forecasting errors and the forecasts of the control area balances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bidding behavior; Intraday electricity prices; Renewable energies,Commerce; Costs; Errors; Bidding behavior; Demand/supply market; Econometric analysis; Electricity prices; Exogenous variables; Market participants; Prior information; Renewable energies; Forecasting; alternative energy; econometrics; electricity supply; photovoltaic system; price determination; wind power; Germany,3,1,2,1,Fokus på analyse og drivere av pris på intraday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basis of Spot Rate Forecasts method is to assume that the market expectations implied by the current spot rate curve will be fulfilled, and heuristic representativeness characteristics are followed; this method has the capability to predict the following cycle of energy price under uncertainties (similar method in logically predicting future spot rate curve). The methodology of determining a rational redundancy level of power system equipment based on coordination among the total transfer capability (TTC) in the transmission system and the estimation of random equipment failures remain the same.

The parameters of the model with mean and variance specifications are estimated simultaneously by the method of approximate maximum likelihood. The methods are implemented for time series of 1,200-4,400 daily price observations in four European power markets. Apart from persistence, heteroscedasticity, and extreme observations in prices, a novel empirical finding is the importance of day-of-the-week periodicity in the autocovariance function of electricity spot prices. In particular, the very persistent daily log prices from the Nord Pool power exchange of Norway are effectively modeled by our framework, which is also extended with explanatory variables to capture supply-and-demand effects. The daily log prices of the other three electricity markets - EEX in Germany, Powernext in France, and APX in The Netherlands - are less persistent, but periodicity is also highly significant. The dynamic behavior differs from market to market and depends primarily on the method of power generation: hydro power, power generated from fossil fuels, or nuclear power.

Continuous time mean reverting and time varying mean reverting stochastic processes have been solved in discrete time processes and estimated econometrically along with ARMAX and GARCH models. It was found that GARCH model gave much better estimation and forecasting ability.

Huisman R.,The influence of temperature on spike probability in day-ahead power prices,2008,32,"It is well known that day-ahead prices in power markets exhibit spikes and time-varying volatility. Spikes and extremely high volatility are the results of (short-term) frictions in demand and/or supply conditions. It is known that information on load or the reserve margin help to forecast spikes. However, these variables are not (timely) available for every market participant and this paper suggests to use temperature as a proxy.

"Chan K.F., Gray P., van Campen B.",A new approach to characterizing and forecasting electricity price volatility,2008,45,"There is a growing need to model the dynamics of electricity spot prices. While many studies have adopted the jump-diffusion model used successfully in traditional financial markets, the distinctive features of energy prices present non-trivial challenges. In particular, electricity price series feature extreme jumps of magnitudes rarely seen in financial markets, and occurring at greater frequency. Standard parametric approaches to estimating jump-diffusion models struggle to disentangle the jump and non-jump variation. This paper explores a recently-developed approach to separating the total variation into jump and non-jump components. Using quadratic variation theory, we non-parametrically estimate jump parameters for five power markets which are known to feature some important physical differences. The unique characteristics of the jump and non-jump components of the total variation are studied for each market. Given the evidence that the two sources of variation in spot prices have distinct dynamics, the paper explores whether volatility forecasts can be improved by explicitly incorporating the jump and non-jump components of the total variation. © 2008 International Institute of Forecasters.",Bipower variation; Jumps; Quadratic variation; Realized volatility; Volatility forecast,,"3, 4",0,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Mandal P., Srivastava A.K., Negnevitsky M., Park J.-W.",Sensitivity analysis of neural network parameters to improve the performance of electricity price forecasting,2009,11,"This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of neural network (NN) parameters to improve the performance of electricity price forecasting. The presented work is an extended version of previous works done by authors to integrate NN and similar days (SD) method for predicting electricity prices. Focus here is on sensitivity analysis of NN parameters while keeping the parameters same for SD to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in the PJM market. Sensitivity analysis of NN parameters include back-propagation learning set (BP-set), learning rate (η), momentum (α) and NN learning days (dN N). The SD parameters, i.e. time framework of SD (d = 45 days) and number of selected similar price days (N=5) are kept constant for all the simulated cases. Forecasting performance is carried out by choosing two different days from each season of the year 2006 and for which, the NN parameters for the base case are considered as BP-set=500, η=0.8, α=0.1 and dNN = 45 days. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the value of BP-set (500, 1000, 1500); η (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2), α (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and dNN (15, 30, 45 and 60 days). The most favorable value of BP-set is first found out from the sensitivity analysis followed by that of η and α, and based on which the best value of dNN is determined. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the best value of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained when BP-set = 500, η= 0.8, α=0.1 and dNN = 60 days for winter season. For spring, summer and autumn, these values are 500, 0.6, 0.1 and 45 days, respectively. MAPE, forecast mean square error and mean absolute error of reasonably small value are obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. Numerical results show that forecasts generated by developed NN model based on the most favorable case are accurate and efficient.

"Amountzias C., Dagdeviren H., Patokos T.",Pricing decisions and market power in the uk electricity market: A VECM approach,2017,11,"This paper examines the influence of market power in the formation of retail and wholesale electricity prices in the UK over 1998–2012 on the basis of Vector Error Correction model (VECM). Market power is measured as the influence of the market share of the Big Six in a dynamic demand and supply VECM. The findings indicate that market power of the Big Six in the wholesale industry has a significant and large positive influence on the wholesale mark-up in the short-run. The long-run estimates support the arguments about ‘revenue rebalancing’ resulting from vertical integration. That is, low market power (and hence low revenues) in the wholesale industry leads to higher prices (hence higher revenues) in the retail industry. These findings are in contrast to the CMA's finding that no market power is exercised in the wholesale industry. Retail electricity prices are affected directly by both the wholesale and retail market concentration ratios in the long-run rather than indirectly through the wholesale mark-up.

Demonstration of this relationship is given as a test case for the Western Danish price area of the Nord Pool's Elspot market. Impact on the average price behavior is investigated as well as that on the distributional properties of the price. By using a non-parametric regression model to assess the effects of wind power forecasts on the average behavior, the non-linearities and time variations in the relationship are captured well and the effects are shown to be quite substantial. Furthermore, by evaluating the distributional properties of the spot prices under different scenarios, the impact of the wind power forecasts on the price distribution is proven to be considerable. The conditional price distribution is moreover shown to be non-Gaussian. This implies that forecasting models for electricity spot prices for which parameters are estimated by a least squares techniques will not have Gaussian residuals. Hence the widespread assumption of Gaussian residuals from electricity spot price models is shown to be inadequate for these model types.

In this paper, we consider the problem of understanding how fundamental drivers impact the probability of extreme price occurrences in the German day-ahead electricity market. We develop models using fundamental variables to predict the probability of extreme prices. The dynamics of negative prices and positive price spikes differ greatly. Positive spikes are related to high demand, low supply and high prices the previous days, and mainly occur during the morning and afternoon peak hours. Negative prices occur mainly during the night and are closely related to low demand combined with high wind production levels. Furthermore, we do a closer analysis of how renewable energy sources, hereby photovoltaic and wind power, impact the probability of negative prices and positive spikes. The models confirm that extremely high and negative prices have different drivers, and that wind power is particularly important in relation to negative price occurrences. The models capture the main drivers of both positive and negative extreme price occurrences and perform well with respect to accurately forecasting the probability with high levels of confidence. Our results suggest that probability models are well suited to aid in risk management for market participants in day-ahead electricity markets. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Energy markets; EPEX; Fundamental analysis; Spikes,,4,1,1,2,Spår sannsynligheten for ekstreme priser,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, we are interested in the simultaneous occurrence of such so-called spikes in two or more markets. Our approach is based on a novel dynamic model for multivariate binary outcomes, which allows the latent variables driving these observed outcomes to follow a vector autoregressive process. Furthermore the model is constructed using a copula representation for the joint distribution of the resulting innovations. This has several advantages over the standard multivariate probit model. First, it allows for nonlinear dependence between the error terms. Second, the distribution of the latent errors can be chosen freely. Third, the computational burden can be greatly reduced making estimation feasible in higher dimensions and for large samples. The model is applied to spikes in half-hourly electricity prices in four interconnected Australian markets. The multivariate model provides a superior fit compared to single-equation models and generates better forecasts for spike probabilities. Furthermore, evidence of spillover dynamics between the markets is revealed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Copulas; Electricity price spikes; Multivariate binary choice models; Vector autoregression,Bins; Commerce; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Australian electricity market; Auto regressive process; Binary choice models; Copulas; Electricity price spikes; Modeling and forecasting; Multivariate modeling; Vector autoregressions; Costs; electricity supply; energy market; modeling; multivariate analysis; price dynamics; vector autoregression; Australia,4,1,1,"1, 2",Spikes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electricity price forecasting has thus emerged as a progressive field of study and numerous researches have been conducted to improve and optimize the price forecast methods. This paper proposes a precise and computationally efficient method to perform price forecasting in deregulated power markets. A locally linear neuro-fuzzy model is developed for price forecasting. The model is trained by a locally linear model tree (LOLIMOT) learning algorithm. An appropriate input selection based on correlation analysis is considered to develop the model. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed model, three major power markets almost serving as global benchmarks for price forecasting studies are tested and the results are verified using real observed data for various forecasting scenarios. Furthermore, the performance of the suggested model is comprehensively compared to the most recent studies available in the literature using various assessment criteria.

"Shrestha G.B., Qiao S.",Statistical characterization of electricity price in competitive power markets,2010,8,"Forecasting of electricity price in the competitive power market has become very important for the market participants in order to support their planning and operations activities. In addition to the change in prices caused by the demand levels (reflected in normal interaction between supply and demand), numerous other factors affect the electricity price including the sudden surges in prices which are frequently caused by unexpected outages. This paper attempts to represent the price at any one period as a random variable which may be treated statistically. Historical price data from Singapore market (USEP) are used to study the behavior of the market price in order to identify the possible statistical distributions and then hypothesis tests are formulated and carried out to determine the theoretical distributions which are best supported by the historical data. It is shown that the raw price data may not be directly amenable to statistical representation. However, suitable processing of the data such as filtering out the extreme values or suitable regrouping of the data may be carried out to bring out the underlying statistical characteristics of the price behavior. It is shown that the market price behavior may support more than one theoretical distribution although the log normal distribution was found to fit the historical data best. ©2010 IEEE.","Competitive electricity market; Electricity price; Hypothesis testing; Statistical distributions - normal, log-normal, and weibull distributions",Competitive electricity markets; Competitive power markets; Electricity price; Electricity prices; Extreme value; Historical data; Hypothesis testing; Hypothesis tests; Log-normal distribution; Market participants; Market price; Singapore; Statistical characteristics; Statistical characterization; Statistical distribution; Statistical representations; Supply and demand; Commerce; Data processing; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Normal distribution; Random variables; Statistical tests; Statistics; Weibull distribution; Costs,4,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Haugom E., Westgaard S., Solibakke P.B., Lien G.",Modelling day ahead nord pool forward price volatility: Realized volatility versus GARCH models,2010,5,"Traditionally, and still within electricity futures/forward markets, daily data has been utilized as the unit of analyses when modelling and making predictions of volatility. However, over the recent past it is argued that better volatility estimates can be obtained by using standard time series techniques on non-parametric volatility measures constructed from high-frequency intradaily returns. Liquidity in financial electricity markets has increased rapidly over the recent years, which make it possible to apply these relatively new methods for measuring market volatility. In this paper high-frequency data and the concept of realized volatility is utilized to make day ahead predictions of Nord Pool forward price volatility. Such short term volatility predictions are especially important for operators and other participants in the electricity sector. We compare the results obtained from standard time-series techniques with the more traditional GARCH-framework which utilizes daily returns. Additionally, we examine whether different approaches of decomposing the total variation into a continuous - and jump measure improves the model fit or not.

"Pany P.K., Ghosal S.P.",Intelligent systems for dynamic price forecasting in a competitive electricity market,2010,2,"The electric power industry in many countries all around the world is evolving into an era of market economy with deregulation and free competition. The understanding of electric power supply as a public service is being replaced by the notion that a competitive market is a more appropriate mechanism to supply energy to consumers with high reliability and low cost [1]. A key element of the electricity sector restructuring is the establishment of a market-driven price for electricity. The pricing system of electricity plays an important role in a competitive market. In the power market, the electricity price depends on the evolution of balance between the demand for electricity and the available supply. At the same time, many other market factors also influence the electricity price, such as economic growth, weather, the power-plant mix, the prices of fuels and the strategic behavior of large players (usually on the generation side). An active, fully competitive and liquid spot market for wholesale electricity will translate the physical risk of inadequate capacity into a financial risk of high prices and place higher requirements on price forecasting. Producers and consumers rely on price-forecasting information to propose their corresponding bidding strategies. If a producer has an accurate forecast of the prices, it can develop a bidding strategy to maximize its profit. On the other hand, a consumer can make a plan to minimize his own electricity cost if an accurate price forecast is available. © 2010 IEEE.",Autoregressive moving average; Conventional wavelet neural network; Dilation and translation; Lolac linear wavelet neural network,Autoregressive moving average; Bidding strategy; Competitive electricity markets; Competitive markets; Conventional wavelet neural network; Dilation and translation; Dynamic price; Economic growths; Electric power industries; Electric power supply; Electricity costs; Electricity prices; Electricity sector restructuring; Financial risks; High price; High reliability; Key elements; Lolac linear wavelet neural network; Low costs; Market economies; Market factors; Physical risks; Power markets; Price forecasting; Price forecasts; Pricing systems; Public services; Spot market; Strategic Behavior; Wholesale electricity; Commerce; Competition; Deregulation; Economics; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Electricity; Industrial electronics; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Power quality; Profitability; Robotics; Weather forecasting; Costs,"4, 5",1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electricity price spikes can also have serious economical effects on the market participants. However, prediction of electricity price spikes is a complex task and most of current electricity price forecast methods focus on prediction of normal prices.

Also, the strategy includes a new closed loop prediction mechanism composed of probabilistic neural network (PNN) and hybrid neuro-evolutionary system (HNES) forecast engines.

However, forecasting is a rather complex task since electricity prices involve many features comparably with financial ones. Electricity markets have a highly volatile nature. They are indeed a more unpredictable than that of other commodities referred to as extreme volatile. In this paper, the two most emerging European electricity markets are considered. A preliminary analysis of the time series attests to the presence of a long range dependance behaviour. Therefore, prices processes are modelled using ARFIMA-FIGARCH under Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions. Such models are sufficiently flexible to handle the long memory phenomena often encountered in both conditional mean and conditional variance in electricity spot prices.

"Pape C., Hagemann S., Weber C.",Are fundamentals enough? Explaining price variations in the German day-ahead and intraday power market,2016,42,"European electricity market participants are encouraged to balance intraday deviations from their day-ahead schedules via trades in the intraday market. Together with the increasing production of variable renewable energy sources (RES), the intraday market is gaining importance. We investigate the explanatory power of a fundamental modeling approach explicitly accounting for must-run operations of combined heat and power plants (CHP) and intraday peculiarities such as a shortened intraday supply stack. The fundamental equilibria between every hour's supply stack and aggregated demand in 2012 and 2013 are modeled to yield hourly price estimates. The major benefits of a fundamental modeling approach are the ability to account for non-linearities in the supply stack and the ability to combine time-varying information consistently. The empirical results show that fundamental modeling explains a considerable share of spot price variance. However, differences between the fundamental and actual prices persist and are explored using regression models.

"Bandyopadhayay A., Roy S., Ghosh D.",Forecasting day-ahead price of electricity - A dynamic regression approach,2013,6,"The electricity market is being deregulated all over the world. Deregulation has brought in a variety of trading systems such as day-ahead trading and has also introduced high volatility of electricity prices. The large variability of price increases the risk for the market participants and forces the business houses to look for a forecasting accuracy of about ± 3%. This paper provides a method to predict next-day electricity prices using dynamic regression methodology where the price was regressed on selected demand, as well as supply side variables available in the public domain, and the error has been modelled using ARIMA / SARIMA models. The results were found to be very encouraging with MAPE lying in the range of ± 3.5% in most cases. In order to reduce the complexity associated with developing many models, a clustering methodology was used to group the different hours of the day so as to reduce the number of forecasting models to be fitted. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with single linkage was used and models for representative hours had the required level of accuracy.

A range of earlier published models for forecasting of balancing market prices, including a few extensions, is benchmarked. The models are benchmarked both for 1 h-ahead and day-ahead forecast, and both point and interval forecasts are compared. None of the benchmarked models produce informative day-ahead point forecasts, suggesting that information available before the closing of the day-ahead market is efficiently reflected in the day-ahead market price rather than the balancing market price.

A probable reason for less attention is uncertainty about various factors in the long run, for instance- oil price, regulatory policies, political intervention, technological changes, energy mix, grid operations, etc. As a general operation, energy generated through different sources is supplied to grid which is finally composed of ""energy mix"". A large decision on the finalisation of retail electricity price could also depend on the load factors and capacity utilization of energy generating plants.

"Pereira A.J.C., Saraiva J.T.",Long term impact of wind power generation in the Iberian day-ahead electricity market price,2013,25,"The Iberian power systems went through important changes at the legal, regulatory and organizational levels in the last 20 years. One of the most relevant ones was the increasing penetration of distributed generation, namely wind parks, together with the development of the common market involving Portugal and Spain. In Portugal, distributed generation is paid using feed in tariffs while in Spain it can choose between receiving a regulated feed in tariff or the market price plus a participation prize. The feed in scheme is now under discussion since it is argued that it represents an excessive cost that is internalized in the end user tariffs. However, this discussion is frequently conducted without complete knowledge of the real impact of wind power on the electricity market price, since it contributes to reduce the demand on the market thus inducing a price reduction. To clarify these issues we used a long term System Dynamics based model already reported in a previous publication to estimate the long term evolution of the market price. This model was applied to the Iberian generation system using different shares of wind power capacity to quantify the impact of wind power on the day-ahead electricity market price. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity markets; Electricity price; Iberian electricity market; Long term impact; System Dynamics model; Wind power,Commerce; Distributed power generation; Electric industry; System theory; Wind power; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Iberian electricity market; Long-term impacts; System dynamics model; Costs; alternative energy; demand analysis; electricity industry; energy market; power generation; price dynamics; regulatory framework; renewable resource; wind farm; wind power; Iberian Peninsula,4,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Shrivastava N.A., Panigrahi B.K., Lim M.-H.",Electricity price classification using extreme learning machines,2016,13,"Forecasting electricity prices has been a widely investigated research issue in the deregulated power market scenario. High price volatilities, price spikes caused by a number of factors such as weather uncertainty, fluctuating fuel prices, transmission bottlenecks, etc., make the task of accurate price forecasting a formidable challenge for the market participants. A number of models have been proposed by researchers; however, achieving high accuracy is always not possible. In some specific applications such as self-scheduling by demand side participants, certain price thresholds are more useful than accurate price forecasts. In this paper, we have investigated the application of a novel neural network-based technique called extreme learning machine for the problem of classification of future electricity prices with respect to certain price thresholds.

As such, a literature has developed that focuses on forecasting the probability of such spike events, moving beyond simply forecasting the level of price. Many univariate time series models have been proposed to deal with spikes within an individual market region. This paper is the first to develop a multivariate self-exciting point process model for dealing with price spikes across connected regions in the Australian National Electricity Market. The importance of the physical infrastructure connecting the regions on the transmission of spikes is examined.

We apply seven averaging and one selection scheme and perform a backtesting analysis on day-ahead electricity prices in three major European and US markets. Our findings support the additional benefit of combining forecasts of individual methods for deriving more accurate predictions, however, the performance is not uniform across the considered markets and periods. In particular, equally weighted pooling of forecasts emerges as a simple, yet powerful technique compared with other schemes that rely on estimated combination weights, but only when there is no individual predictor that consistently outperforms its competitors. Constrained least squares regression (CLS) offers a balance between robustness against such well performing individual methods and relatively accurate forecasts, on average better than those of the individual predictors.

The increasing share of variable renewables in European power systems create a downward adequacy problem, which deals with the ability of power systems to cope with periods of excess generation. The occurrence of negative prices on Central Western European electricity markets confirms the relevance of this issue, which is referred to as ""incompressibility of power systems"" and is assessed as a barrier for further renewable power integration.

Results confirm a positive relation with the scheduled generation of renewables and inflexible base load, as well as a negative relation with the scheduled system load. Furthermore, the occurrence of negative prices is related to the positive and negative forecast error of renewable generation and demand, respectively.

"Dillig M., Jung M., Karl J.",The impact of renewables on electricity prices in Germany - An estimation based on historic spot prices in the years 2011-2013,2016,58,Germanys public opinion and media usually attribute increasing electricity prices to the high share of renewables in the German power system. But average electricity prices at the European Energy Exchange dropped during the last years due to an excess of renewable energy. This study uses historic market data in order to quantify the effect of renewables on prices. Historic demand and supply curves from 2011 to 2013 have been used to reconstruct electricity prices under the assumption that no wind and PV would be available. The analysis reveals an astonishingly high increase of market prices up to 5.29 ct/kWh due to a lack of non-renewable power capacities. In 2013 the available conventional capacity would not have been able to cover the demand during 269 hours. The estimated maximum deficit of 5.6 GW is in good agreement to data published by the German grid operators. The discussion of the origin of this deficit leads to the conclusion that the current situation has not been caused by renewables.

"Chen Y., Li M., Yang Y., Li C., Li Y., Li L.",A hybrid model for electricity price forecasting based on least square support vector machines with combined kernel,2018,3,"With the continuous development of the global electricity market, the electricity market needs the electricity price forecasting result to be accurate, and electricity price forecasting also has more profound practical significance. Accurate price forecasting can not only better reflect the operation of the electricity market but also help to make better decisions about the electricity market. However, the electricity price is affected by a variety of uncertain subjective and objective factors, as well as the constraints of the power system, making it more difficult to obtain accurate electricity price forecasting than electricity load forecasting. The kernel function occupies a very important position in a support vector machine (SVM), which is the key to the mature development of SVM theory. When using SVM for classification and regression, the appropriate kernel function is the basis and precondition for obtaining better classification and approximation effects. In this paper, a new combinatorial kernel function that combines RBF and UKF kernel functions is proposed and is applied to a least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and based on this, a new hybrid model empirical mode (EMD)-Mixed-LSSVM is proposed to forecast electricity price.

"Nair I., Robert A.",A chaotic model approach for electricity price forecasting in Indian scenario,2017,,"In a deregulated power market, the electricity prices exhibit extreme volatility due to its non-storable nature, supply constraints at peak hours, transmission line congestion at peak hours and seasonal and diurnal variations. The objective of this paper is to model the day-ahead market price of Indian energy exchange (IEX) based on time series modelling approach. The detailed analysis of market clearing price (MCP) collected from IEX clearly indicates the chaotic nature of data. It is because of this chaotic behaviour, the phase space of the time series data is reconstructed using Taken's theorem. With the concept of the add-weighted one-rank multi-step model, the MCP of IEX is modelled as a chaotic model from this reconstructed phase space. Furthermore, the developed chaotic model is verified for forecasting MCP and the simulation results demonstrate that the chaotic model developed outperforms the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model in terms of in sample forecasting performances.

"Bebarta D.K., Bisoi R., Dash P.K.",Mining of electricity prices in energy markets using a hybrid linear ARMA and nonlinear functional link neural network trained by evolutionary unscented H-infinity filter,2017,,"This paper presents a hybrid autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and a nonlinear functional link neural network for electricity price forecasting in an Energy market. The functional neural block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher dimensional space through a basis function without using any hidden layers like MLP structure. Unlike the conventional functional link artificial neural network (FLANN), the input layer comprises the inputs and tangent hyperbolic functions of the linear combination of the inputs known as the basis functions. The proposed hybrid neural network is trained by an unscented H-infinity filter to provide an accurate forecasting of day ahead electricity prices. The noise covariance parameters of the unscented H-infinity filter are further optimised with an adaptive differential evolution strategy. The studies on PJM, Spanish and Australian energy market markets exhibit excellent forecasting results over different seasonal horizons for one day ahead of time.

"Zarnikau J., Woo C.-K., Zhu S.",Zonal merit-order effects of wind generation development on day-ahead and real-time electricity market prices in Texas,2016,7,"This paper uses a regression-based approach to explore the impact of wind generation development on wholesale electricity prices in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market. We find that wind generation development has a greater effect on real-time market (RTM) prices than day-ahead market (DAM) prices. Higher wind generation forecast errors tend to reduce the RTMprices, chiefly because unanticipated increases in wind generation reduce the real-time net loads to be served by fossil fuel power plants. Improving ERCOT’s load and wind generation forecast accuracy tends to make theDAMand RTMprices converge, thus enhancing ERCOT’s market trading efficiency. Finally, the estimated merit-order effects are greatest in the ERCOT zones where the wind generation capacity locally resides. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.",Day-ahead market; Electric reliability council of texas (ercot); Merit-order effects; Real-time market; Wind generation,,0,0,2,0,ikke relevant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maisano J., Radchik A., Skryabin I.",A method of forecasting wholesale electricity market prices,2016,1,"In this paper, we employ a fundamental principle of classical mechanics known as the least-action principle to model the complex relationship between expected load and expected price in electricity spot markets.We consider markets that feature a centralized electricity dispatch system that optimizes grid parameters to determine the minimum spot nodal prices. Using the example of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) and a calibrated stochastic demand model, we develop a mathematical approach that determines the price evolution, including intraday and seasonal features. The proposed model links the concept of a deterministically modeled price with stochastically modeled demand. The demand-price relationship is complex, and it must include not only the level of demand within the constraint of maximum generating capacity, but also the change in demand within the constraints of generator ramping rates. While this paper uses the NEM as an example, the proposed approach is applicable to any energy market that satisfies the above conditions. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.",Electricity market; Forecasting; Least-action principle (lap); National electricity market (nem); Spot price forecasting; Structural model,,0,0,1,0,ingen tilgang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These only admit a highly aggregated representation of the market. Instead, we propose to forecast the entire volume-weighted price distribution.

We conduct a forecasting study on data from the German intraday market and aim to forecast the quantiles for the last three hours before delivery. We compare the performance of several linear regression models and an ensemble of neural networks to several well designed naive benchmarks.

"Olsson M., Söder L.",Modeling real-time balancing power market prices using combined SARIMA and Markov processes,2008,69,This paper describes modeling of real-time balancing power market prices by using combined seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and discrete Markov processes. The combination of such processes allows generation of price series with periods where no demand for balancing power exists. The purpose of the model is simulation of prices to construct scenario trees representing possible realization of the stochastic prices. Such scenario trees can be used in planning models based on stochastic optimization to generate bid sequences to the balancing market. The spread of the prices in the tree and the shape of the scenarios are of central importance. Model parameter estimation methods reflecting the demands on scenario trees have therefore been used. The proposed model is also applied to data from the Nordic power market. The conclusion of this paper is that the developed model is appropriate for modeling real-time balancing power prices. © 2008 IEEE.,Markov processes; Power prices; SARIMA processes; Scenario generation; Time series analysis,Marketing; Markov processes; Operating costs; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Trees (mathematics); Power prices; Scenario generation; Seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average; Electric power systems,"3, 4",1,3,1,Wrong market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposes a price volatility module to analyse electricity price spikes and study the probability distribution of electricity price. Two methods are used to study the probability distribution of electricity price; the analytical method and the ANN method. Furthermore, ANN method is used to study the impact of line limits, line outages, generator outages, load pattern and bidding strategy on short term price forecasting, in addition to sensitivity analysis to determine the extent to which these factors impact price forecasting.

Nevertheless, due to the Instability in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather tough to forecast MCPs accurately. Using probabilistic forecasting is a new solution to overcome the low accuracy of forecast. Transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts is too important to model the uncertainties of forecasts. Thus the decision making activities of market participants are supported against uncertainties and risks effectively. In this paper a hybrid approach to achieve prediction intervals (PIs) of MCPs is proposed that modified dolphin echolocation optimization algorithm (MDEOA) is applied to estimate point forecasts, model uncertainties, and noise variance.

Since MCP is a non-stationary process, an adaptive algorithm with fast convergence is important. A common method for MCP prediction is neural networks, and multilayer perceptron networks (MLP) is one of the widely used networks. Back propagation (BP) is a popular learning method for MLP, while BP suffers from slow convergence. This paper presents an integrated learning and interval estimation algorithm for MCP prediction. In the extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework, confidence interval is a natural by-product of EKF, and is integrated with learning process to improve learning results in addition to fast convergence. Since Kalman filter (KF) is a minimum variance estimator for linear system, EKF framework helps to provide a smaller confidence interval, which is preferred in risk management.

Intraday properties of price risk, as represented by the predictive distribution rather than expected values, have previously not been fully analyzed. The sample covers half hourly data from 2005 to 2012. From our analysis we are able to show how the sensitivity towards different fundamental factors changes across quantiles and time of day. In the UK the supply of electricity is to a large extent generated from coal and gas plants, thus the price of gas and coal, as well as the carbon emission price, are included as fundamental factors in our model. We also include the electricity price lagged by one day, as well as demand and margin forecasts. We find that the sensitivities vary across the price distribution. Our findings also suggest that the sensitivity to fundamental factors exhibit intraday variation. We find that the sensitivity to gas relative to coal is higher in high quantiles and lower in low quantiles, as well as some indications of market power being exercised during peak hours. We have demonstrated a scenario analysis based on the quantile regression models, showing how changes in the values of the fundamentals influence the electricity price distribution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity markets; Prices; Quantile regression; Risk,Carbon; Coal; Commerce; Gas plants; Power markets; Regression analysis; Risks; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon emission prices; Electricity prices; Expected values; Predictive distributions; Prices; Quantile regression; Scenario analysis; Trading periods; Costs; carbon emission; demand analysis; energy market; power generation; price dynamics; pricing policy; regression analysis; risk assessment; United Kingdom,4,1,2,2,Article, Sensitivity analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with the emergence of power exchanges and despite the expansion of the research sphere in this context, this issue had not been sufficiently addressed. This is due to not only the lack of concepts in theory but also to the peculiarity of price dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the nature of the relationship between price changes and trading volume in the Nordic power market (Nord Pool), which is one of the largest energy markets worldwide. Through statistical timing analysis of the price-volume covariation, we reconsider this joint modelling, but only settling for daily observations, which makes the specificity of this work. Contrary to most comparable works, which were based on high frequency data, we chose to omit intraday observations to circumvent the repercussion of the daily seasonality on one side and ensure more lucidity and clairvoyance to a wider horizon on the other. The empirical results go in line with our expectations and provide support for the claim that there exists a significant reciprocal causality between prices and trading volume.

"Deng S.-J., Jiang W.",An inverse-quantile function approach for modeling electricity price,2002,2,"We propose a class of alternative stochastic volatility models for electricity prices using the quantile function modeling approach. Specifically, we fit marginal distributions of power prices to two special classes of distributions by matching the quantile of an empirical distribution to that of a theoretical distribution. The distributions from the first class have closed form formulas for probability densities, probability distribution functions, and quantile functions, while the distributions from the second class may have extremely unbalanced tails. Having rich tail behaviors, both classes allow realistic modeling of the power price dynamics. The appealing features of this approach are that it can effectively model the heavy tail behavior of electricity prices caused by jumps and stochastic volatility and that the resulting distributions are easy to simulate. This latter feature enables us to perform both parameter estimation and derivative pricing tasks based on price data directly observed from real markets. © 2002 IEEE.",Electricity supply industry; Energy management; ISO; Mathematical model; Power markets; Power system management; Pricing; Probability distribution; Risk management; Stochastic processes,Commerce; Costs; Distribution functions; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric utilities; Energy management; Inverse problems; Mathematical models; Power markets; Probability; Random processes; Risk management; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Empirical distributions; ISO; Marginal distribution; Power system management; Probability densities; Quantile functions; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic Volatility Model; Probability distributions,4,3,1,2,Conference,Fits parameters to real price.
