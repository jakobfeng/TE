We analyze the Italian day-ahead wholesale electricity market, finding empirical evidence of the merit-order effect. Over the period 2005-2013 an increase of 1. GWh in the hourly average of daily production from solar and wind sources has, on average, reduced wholesale electricity prices by respectively 2.3€/MWh and 4.2€/MWh and has amplified their volatility. The impact on prices has decreased over time in correspondence with the increase in solar and wind electricity production. We estimate that, over the period 2009-2013, solar production has generated higher monetary savings than wind production, mainly because the former is more prominent than the latter. However, in the solar case, monetary savings are not sufficient to compensate the cost of the related supporting schemes which are entirely internalized within end-user tariffs, causing a reduction of the consumer surplus, while the opposite occurs in the case of wind. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity price; Feed-in tariff; Italian wholesale power market; Merit-order effect; Renewables,Commerce; Costs; Power markets; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Electricity prices; Feed-in tariff; Ordering effects; Renewables; Solar production; Supporting scheme; Wholesale electricity; Wholesale electricity markets; Electric power generation; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; power generation; price determination; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Italy

One possible way of reducing these redispatch costs is to introduce demand response in the form of real-time pricing (RTP), which could allow electricity demand to respond to actual real-time wind resource availability using price signals. A day-ahead unit commitment model with day-ahead wind forecasts and a real-time dispatch model with actual wind resource availability is used to estimate system operations in a high wind penetration scenario. System operations are compared to a perfect foresight benchmark, in which actual wind resource availability is known day-ahead. The results show that wind integration costs with fixed demands can be high, both due to real-time redispatch costs and lost load. It is demonstrated that introducing RTP can reduce redispatch costs and eliminate loss of load events. Finally, social surplus with wind generation and RTP is compared to a system with neither and the results demonstrate that introducing wind and RTP into a market can result in superadditive surplus gains. © 2010 IEEE.",Power system economics; Real-time pricing; Unit commitment; Wind forecast errors; Wind power generation,Power system economics; Real time pricing; Unit commitments; Wind forecast errors; Wind forecasts; Cost reduction; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Errors; Integration; Internet protocols; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Electric load forecasting

The producer is a price-taker in the day-ahead market, but a price-maker in the balancing market, and aims at optimizing its expected revenues from these market floors. The problem is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and cast as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which can be solved employing off-the-shelf optimization software. The optimal bid is shown to deliver significantly improved performance compared to traditional bids such as the conditional mean or median forecast of wind power distribution. Finally, sensitivity analyses are carried out to assess the impact on the offering strategy of the producer's penetration in the market, of the correlation between wind power production and residual system deviation, and of the shape of the forecast distribution of wind power production. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Electricity markets; mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints; offering strategies; price-maker; wind power,Electricity market; Forecast distribution; Mathematical program with equilibrium constraints; Mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints; Mixed integer linear program; offering strategies; price-maker; Wind power distribution; Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Integer programming; Optimization; Wind power; Weather forecasting

This is particularly true when energy prices are capped in order to mitigate market power. The northeastern U.S. independent system operators (ISOs) have responded to this issue by establishing capacity obligations for loads and markets for installed capacity, thus providing a capacity revenue stream to generators. The installed capacity (ICAP) markets in the northeastern U.S. markets are a response to this need for additional incentives to construct generation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has accepted the PJM Interconnection's (PJM) proposal to replace the present fixed ICAP requirement that is placed upon load serving entities (LSEs) with a demand curve-based system in which the ISO would be responsible for acquiring ""residual"" capacity on behalf of LSEs. The demand curve approach pays more when reserve margins are smaller and provides a reduced incentive for investment when installed reserves are above the target. Another goal is to make revenues more predictable for generators, making investment less costly and, ultimately, lowering prices for consumers. A dynamic representative agent model is presented for projecting effects upon reserve margins, generator profitability, and consumer costs and is applied to alternative demand curves proposed for the PJM market. The consumer costs resulting from a sloped demand curve are robustly lower compared to the present fixed requirement under a wide range of assumptions concerning behavior of generation owners, including risk attitudes, bidding behavior, and willingness to build capacity as a function of forecast profit. The cost savings arise from lower capital costs to generators due to reduced risk and risk premiums. Also, average installed capacity is less for the same level of reliability because of reduced fluctuations in installed reserves. © 2007 IEEE.",Economics; Power generation economics; Power generation peaking capacity,Costs; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Forecasting; Industrial economics; Investments; Marketing; Mathematical models; Reliability theory; Independent system operators; Power generation economics; Power generation peaking capacity; Reliability pricing model; Electric power systems

The demand for emission reductions is lowered, as a result the CO2-price is also reduced. Consequently the wholesale price for electricity decreases. However, most RES-E support systems are financed via the electricity market, which increases the retail electricity price. An assessment for Germany shows that retail electricity prices in the first trading period of the EU-ETS 2005-2007 are lowered by 2.6 Euro / MWh due to additional RES-E. Considering the complete EU, the effect is substantially higher. This paper describes the effect and the influence of different policy designs. It develops an approach for assessing the effect and applies it for the case of Germany and roughly estimates the effect for the EU. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Many researchers argue that pro rata electricity tariff, with built in positive marginal cost of pumping could bring about efficient use of the resource, though some argue that the levels of tariff in which demand becomes elastic to pricing are too high to be viable from political and socio-economic points of view. The paper presents a theoretical model to analyze farmers' response to changes in power tariff and water allocation regimes vis à vis energy and groundwater use. It validates the model by analyzing water productivity in groundwater irrigation under different electricity pricing structures and water allocation regimes. Water productivity was estimated using primary data of gross crop inputs, cost of all inputs, and volumetric water inputs. The analysis shows that unit pricing of electricity influences groundwater use efficiency and productivity positively. It also shows that the levels of pricing at which demand for electricity and groundwater becomes elastic to tariff are socio-economically viable. Further, water productivity impacts of pricing would be highest when water is volumetrically allocated with rationing. Therefore, an effective power tariff policy followed by enforcement of volumetric water allocation could address the issue of efficiency, sustainability and equity in groundwater use in India. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

These markets have been used in Europe to promote generation of electricity from renewable resources like wind. Similar markets have been proposed in the United States of America (USA) where the certificates are called Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). The certificates are issued to the generating companies for each megawatt-hour of renewable electricity generation. The companies may sell the certificates in a market, and the revenues from certificate sales provide an extra incentive to invest in new generating capacity. Proponents argue that this market-based incentive can be designed to support government mandates for a growing fraction of electricity generation from renewable sources. In the USA, these mandates are set by the states and are known as Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). We simulate the price dynamics of a market designed to support an aggressive mandate for wind generation in the northwestern USA. The simulations show that the certificate price climbs rapidly to the cap in the early years after the market opens. Investors then react to these high prices with construction of new wind capacity. After a few years, wind generation meets, and then exceeds the requirement. We show that this pattern appears again and again when the simulations are repeated with wide variations in the estimates of behavioral parameters. We use the model to study the impact of different trading strategies by the wind companies and by the distribution companies. We also study the simulated market response if the USA adopts the carbon allowance market envisioned in The Climate Stewardship Act. The article concludes with recommendations for policy makers involved in TGC market design. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Price Responsive Demand could provide significant reliability and economic benefits. However, existing RTO tariffs present potential barriers to the development of Price Responsive Demand. Effectively integrating Price Responsive Demand into RTO markets and operations will require changes in demand forecasting, scarcity pricing reform, synchronization of scarcity pricing with capacity markets, tracking voluntary hedging by price responsive loads, and a non-discriminatory approach in curtailments in capacity emergencies.

The proposed approach is based on a nonlinear bilevel programming framework that involves the interests of two different agents: the DG owner who procures the maximization of the profits obtained from the energy sales, and the Distribution Company (DisCo), which procures the minimization of the payments incurred in attending the forecasted demand. To meet the forecasted demand the DisCo can purchase energy either from the wholesale energy market or from the DG units within its network. The proposed GA determines both the location and contract pricing of the DG units that would render maximum profits to the DG owner, subject to the minimization of payments procured by the DisCo.

With this target predominantly fulfilled with wind generated electricity, the need for increased grid flexibility to facilitate this intermittent energy source is becoming ever more significant. As smart metering becomes available, demand side participation will be one option for achieving this flexibility. Using an immersion heated hot water tank as an example, this paper examines the impact that price optimised load scheduling has on the facilitation of wind generated electricity. To replicate real-world data availability, optimisation is performed using day-ahead predicted prices while the results are calculated using final prices and metered generation data. The results demonstrate a correlation between the day-ahead predicted half-hourly price of electricity and real-time wind availability. This supports the use of price as a means of providing an incentive for load response in order to increase the amount of renewable energy that can be facilitated on the electrical grid. Furthermore, various thermal storage efficiencies were examined for the device to reveal that as the energy loss rate of the device is reduced, the financial savings increase, wind generation increases, and conventional generation decreases. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Demand side management; Real-time pricing; Wind energy,Costs; Electricity; Energy dissipation; Heat storage; Water tanks; Wind power; Appliance controls; Conventional generation; Demand side managements; Demand-side; Electrical grids; Electricity market; Energy-loss rate; Financial savings; Hot water tanks; Hourly prices; Intermittent energy source; Ireland; Load response; Load scheduling; Optimisations; Price-based; Real time pricing; Real world data; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Smart metering; Thermal storage; Wind energy; Wind generation; Electric generators; data assimilation; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy market; energy resource; optimization; renewable resource; wind power; Ireland

We propose and implement a model in which the spot price of power is a function of two state variables: demand (load) and fuel price. In this model, any power derivative price must satisfy a PDE with boundary conditions that reflect capacity limits and the non-linear relation between load and the spot price of power. Moreover, since power is non-storable and demand is not a traded asset, the power derivative price embeds a market price of risk. Using inverse problem techniques and power forward prices from the PJM market, we solve for this market price of risk function. During 1999-2001, the upward bias in the forward price was as large as $50/MWh for some days in July. By 2005, the largest estimated upward bias had fallen to $19/MWh. These large biases are plausibly due to the extreme right skewness of power prices; this induces left skewness in the payoff to short forward positions, and a large risk premium is required to induce traders to sell power forwards. This risk premium suggests that the power market is not fully integrated with the broader financial markets. © 2008.",Derivatives pricing; Electricity markets; Inverse techniques; Market price of risk,

Therefore, it is beneficial to system planners if the congestion or locational marginal pricing (LMP) versus load is readily available. This can certainly be obtained by repetitively running an optimization model at different load levels. However, this approach is too brute-force to be practical. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is proposed to identify the new binding constraint and the new marginal unit set when the system load increases from the present load level. It addresses the challenge of step changes in generation dispatch when a generation or transmission limit becomes binding. The algorithm also gives the new sensitivity of the new marginal units. Therefore, the generation dispatch, congested lines, and LMP at a new critical load level (CLL) can be easily calculated. Test results are presented in matrix formulation to clearly demonstrate and verify the proposed algorithm. Since the proposed approach is based on linearized model, it should be particularly suitable for short-term planning or operation, although application to long-term planning is also possible. © 2009 IEEE.",Congestion management; Critical load level (CLL); Energy markets; Generation sensitivity; Locational marginal pricing (LMP); Optimal power flow (OPF); Power markets,Congestion management; Critical load level (CLL); Energy markets; Generation sensitivity; Locational marginal pricing (LMP); Optimal power flow (OPF); Power markets; Acoustic generators; Binding energy; Commerce; Costs; Electric load flow; Optimization; Power electronics; Loads (forces)

The high volatility regime is predominant in phases when economic activities are on a decrease or when institutional changes harm the confidence in the stringency of the EU ETS. This holds during the recession of 2008 and 2009, as well as during 2011 and 2012 when the debt crisis impaired the European economic outlook. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",EU ETS; EUA price fundamentals; Markov regime-switching,Economic activities; Economic outlook; Energy prices; High volatility; Institutional change; Markov regime-switching; Nonlinear relations; Price fundamentals; Commerce; Economics; Gas emissions; Costs; economic activity; energy market; European Union; macroeconomics; Markov chain; price dynamics; stock market; Europe

Total cost of reactive power production (CRPP) is represented as a nonlinear model that considers the corresponding economic loss if active power is not generated; that cost is the opportunity cost. The formulation includes the CRPP of the static compensators. The methodology has been implemented using a modified optimal power flow program that includes a sequential linear programming technique enhanced with a modified predictor-corrector interior-point method. The IEEE-30, -57, -118 systems and a reduced configuration of the interconnected (South-Southeast) Brazilian system have been used for application of the methodology. Results demonstrate that the active and reactive power marginal prices give economical signals that could impel even more the participation of agents of competitive reactive power markets.",,Electric industry; Electric rates; Electric utilities; Industrial economics; Quality control; Reactive power; Reliability theory; Energy imbalances; Reactive power marginal prices (RPMP); Reactive power production costs; Electric power systems

Reforming energy subsidies have important implications for sustainable development through their effects on energy price, energy use and CO2 emission. This paper applies a price-gap approach to estimate China's fossil-fuel related subsidies with the consideration of the external cost. Results indicate that the magnitude of subsidies amounted to CNY 1214.24 billion in 2008, equivalent to 4.04% of GDP of that year. Subsidies for oil products are the largest, followed by subsidies for the coal and electricity. Furthermore, an input-output model is used to analyze the impacts of energy subsidies reform on different industries and general price indexes. The findings show that removal of energy subsidies will have significant impact on energy-intensive industry, and consequently push up the general price level, yet with a small variation. Removing oil products subsidies will have the largest impact, followed by electricity, coal and natural gas. However, no matter which energy price increases, PPI is always the most affected, then GDP deflator, with CPI being the least. Corresponding compensation measures should be accordingly designed to offset the negative impact caused by energy subsidies reform. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Energy prices; Energy subsidies; Input-output model,Compensation measures; Energy intensive industries; Energy prices; Energy subsidies; External costs; Input output model; Price-gap approaches; Small variations; Carbon dioxide; Costs; energy efficiency; energy market; fossil fuel; Gross Domestic Product; input-output analysis; numerical model; price determination; price dynamics; subsidy system; sustainable development; China

The unit root tests allow for structural breaks and are based on the procedures developed by Zivot and Andrews (1992), Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) and Lee and Strazicich (2003). Finally, we investigate whether the trend changes signs in the regimes which are bounded by the structural breaks and quantify the prevalence of the trends over the sample period considered.

Using extensive data from the four ERCOT zones of Texas, this paper develops a two-stage model to attack the issue. The first stage is an ordered-logit regression to identify and quantify, for example, the impact of wind generation in the West zone on the estimated probability of a positive or negative price difference between the North and West zones. The second stage is a log-linear regression model that identifies and quantifies the estimated impact of wind generation on the sizes of those positive and negative price differences. It is shown that high wind generation and low load in the wind-rich ERCOT West zone tend to lead to congestion and zonal price differences, that those differences are time-dependent, and that other factors such as movements in nuclear generation and natural-gas prices, as well as fluctuating non-West zone loads, also play a role. The results have broad implications for energy policy makers that extend well beyond the borders of Texas and, indeed, those of the United States. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",ERCOT; Wind energy; Zonal-market price difference,Energy policy makers; ERCOT; High winds; Low load; Nuclear generation; Price difference; Regression model; Time-dependent; Two stage model; Wholesale electricity; Wind energy; Wind generation; Zonal prices; Zonal-market price difference; Commerce; Energy policy; Linear regression; Wind power; Costs; electricity generation; energy market; energy policy; price dynamics; regression analysis; wind power; Texas; United States

We test these hypotheses using panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2001 to 2016 and employing both constant coefficient and time-varying coefficient panel data models to conduct analyses. Our empirical results show that population growth, increased urbanization, and energy price distortion all intensify environmental pollution, while population aging and rising energy price tend to alleviate environmental pollution.

Within this novel methodology a bidder is considered to follow a Bayes-strategy. Thereby, one bidder is assumed to behave strategically and the behavior of the remaining is summarized in a probability distribution of the market price and a reaction function to price dumping by the strategic bidder. With this approach two problems arise: First, as a pay-as-bid auction is considered, no uniform price and therefore no single probability distribution of the market price is readily available. Second, if historic bidding data of all participants are used to estimate such a distribution and market power is a relevant factor, the bid of the strategically behaving bidder is likely to influence the distribution. Within this paper for both of the problems solutions are presented. It is shown that by estimating a probability of acceptance the optimal bidding price with respect to a given capacity can be calculated by maximizing a stochastic non-linear objective function of expected profit. Taking the characteristics of recently established markets in Germany into account, the methodology is applied using exemplary data. It is shown that the methodology helps to manage existing price uncertainties and hence supports the trading decisions of a bidder. It is inferred that the developed methodology may also be used for bidding on other auction markets with a similar market design. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Some price velocity is expected and arises from the daily diurnal price pattern, which differs significantly between markets. Even when the expected daily variability in price is removed, the residual unexpected variability differs between markets. Some deregulated markets, most notably Britain and Spain, show patterns that are predictable and consistent and have low values of unexpected price velocity. These markets create a climate conducive to consumers facing the market through real time pricing and shaping consumption behaviors in response to price changes.

The value of many of these instruments depends directly on electricity prices. In theory, the wholesale price in a real-time market should reflect the short-run marginal cost, However, most markets are not perfectly competitive, therefore by understanding the degree of correlation between price and physical drivers, electric traders and consumers can manage their risk more effectively and efficiently. Market data from two power-pool architectures, both pre-2003 ISO-NE and Australia's NEM, have been studied. The dynamic character of electricity price is mean-reverting, and consists of intra-day and weekly variations, seasonal fluctuations, and instant jumps. Parts of them are affected by load demands. Hourly signals on both price and load are divided into deterministic and random components with a discrete fourier transform algorithm. Next, the real-time price-load relationship for periodic and random signals is examined. In addition, time-varying volatility models are constructed on random price and random load with the GARCH (1,1) model, and the correlation between them analysed. Volatility plays a critical role on evaluating option pricing and risk management.",,Algorithms; Competitive intelligence; Computer simulation; Costs; Electric loads; Forecasting; Fourier transforms; Frequencies; Mathematical models; Risk management; Transfer functions; Electric power industry; Electric traders; Electricity price; Real-time power markets; Electric power systems

The goal is to increase the overall profit of the portfolio by reducing imbalances and, consequently, their implicit penalty in a two-price balancing market for electricity. We investigate two different operational strategies, which differ in whether the CHP plant and the wind farm are operated jointly or independently, and we evaluate their economic performance on a real case study based on a CHP-wind system located in the western part of Denmark. We present a comprehensive mathematical model for describing the different heat and power production units of the CHP plant and suggest different ways of determining its operation in a setup with two trading floors: a day-ahead market and a balancing market. We build a simulation framework that runs in a rolling-horizon fashion, so that forecasts for heat demand, wind power production, and market prices are updated at each iteration. We conclude that the portfolio strategy is the most profitable due to the two-price structure of the balancing market. This encourages producers to handle their imbalances outside the market. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Balancing market; combined heat and power (CHP); electricity market; optimal portfolio operation; wind power,Commerce; Costs; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Power markets; Profitability; Wind power; Balancing market; Combined heat and power plants; Day ahead market; Economic performance; Operational strategies; Portfolio strategies; Simulation framework; Wind power production; Cogeneration plants

A novel attacking scheme is proposed, in which an attacker jams the signaling of power price and then ceases jamming when the power price has been significantly changed. The power users jammed by the attacker will make a rapid response to the changed power price, whose change direction can be predicted by the attacker. Then, the attacker can manipulate the price in the power market and thus makes profit. The abrupt change of power consumption will also cause a significant impact on the power grid stability. The effect of such an attack will be discussed both analytically and numerically.

The dc optimal power flow (DCOPF) model is still mostly used for the purpose of market clearing owing to its simplicity, robustness and higher speed of convergence. Within the DCOPF framework, transmission line losses are represented as additional external loads on the system. In the classical DCOPF model of marginal loss pricing, as implemented in the New England market, the aggregated network loss is distributed over the system nodes in a fixed ratio. To gain more design flexibility in the distribution of system losses, a matrix loss distribution (MLD) framework is developed in this paper maintaining compatibility with financial transmission rights. In MLD, each individual line is considered separately for the purpose of loss distribution. The ratio in which the power loss in a certain line is distributed can be different from that in which the power loss in another line is distributed. The additional design flexibility thus obtained assists in making a more accurate representation of the power flow. The benefit of MLD is illustrated through a case study. An energy reference independent application of MLD is also suggested. © 2009 IEEE.",Estimation-based loss distribution; Financial transmission rights; Locational marginal price; Marginal loss pricing; Matrix loss distribution; Power flow accuracy; Revenue adequacy; Vector loss distribution,Financial transmission rights; Locational marginal price; Marginal loss pricing; Matrix loss distribution; Power flow accuracy; Revenue adequacy; Commerce; Economics; Electric load flow; Light transmission; Power electronics; Costs

However, the exclusive nonlinearity dynamics of electricity price is a challenge problem that largely affects forecasting accuracy. To address this task, this paper presents a hybrid forecasting framework for short-term electricity price forecasting by exploiting and mining the important information hidden in the electricity price signal. Moreover, a hybrid feature selection method (HFS) is introduced into the forecasting strategy. To exhibit the dynamical characteristics of electricity price, we primarily perform a singular spectrum analysis (SSA)-based systematic analysis process by using the merit of SSA and analyzing the multiple seasonal patterns of short-term electricity price series, providing a meaningful representation of the hidden patterns and time-varying volatility of electricity price series. Aiming at selecting the key features, the candidate variables are constructed considering the dynamic behavior of price series; further, to capture the optimal features from the candidates, the correlation threshold θ is defined for the adjustable parameters in HFS and optimally determined by the intelligent search algorithm. Additionally, triangulation based on the Pearson, Spearman and Kendall rank correlation coefficient is performed to strengthen the reliability of the proposed method. The proposed hybrid forecasting framework is validated in the New South Wales electricity market, which demonstrates that the developed approach is truly better than the benchmark models used and a reliable and promising tool for short-term electricity price forecasting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Hybrid feature selection; Hybrid forecasting; Key features; Price forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis,Commerce; Decision making; Deregulation; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Optimization; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Hybrid feature selections; Hybrid forecasting; Key feature; Price forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis; Power markets; algorithm; correlation; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; price dynamics; spectral analysis; support vector machine

The negative effect of a higher relative price of energy on firm-level investment is significantly less marked the larger the firm.

To establish a proficient price-based congestion management procedure, the nodal pricing strategy is found to be appropriate. From congestion management point of view, the optimal nodal prices are comprised of two basic components. First component is locational marginal price, that is marginal cost of generation to supply load and transmission losses both. Second component is nodal congestion price (NCP), that is the charges to maintain network security. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm based neural network (LMANN) for estimating NCPs in spot power market by dividing the whole power system into various congestion zones is presented. Euclidian distance based clustering technique has been applied for feature selection before employing LMANN. The purpose of using artificial neural network (ANN) based approach for NCP estimation in spot power market is to exploit the tolerance for any missing or partially corrupted data to achieve tractability, robustness and very fast solution. The proposed ANN method also handles the congestion price volatility by taking continuously varying load and constrained transmission into account. The information provided by the proposed method regarding the formation of different congestion zones and the severity of congestion within a zone instructs both the market participants as well as independent system operator in making effective decisions. The proposed method has been examined for an RTS 24-bus system and is found to be quite promising. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2008.",,Algorithms; Cost accounting; Electric power systems; Problem solving; Robustness (control systems); Congestion price estimation; Nodal congestion price (NCP); Nodal pricing strategy; Neural networks

Our methodology is based on the concept of S-adapted open-loop Nash equilibrium. We examine the evolution of capital investments and pricing behavior of suppliers as uncertain electricity demand evolves over time (in Ontario). This study is particularly interesting since we compare the implications of two policies: (i) the current setting in which Ontario Power Generation (OPG) retains its generation units; (ii) the policy (set up in 2003) that required the divestiture of the largest supplier, OPG, and aimed to increase the number of independent suppliers in Ontario. We mainly focus on the independent generators like Bruce Nuclear. We use the tools of Stochastic Programming to compute the S-adapted open-loop Nash equilibrium market outcomes. We find that in the three-player market total capacity installation and market prices are higher than the ones in the five-player market. That is higher capacity may not necessarily alleviate exercise of market power.

A mixed integer linear programming unit commitment model has been developed with the objective of studying optimal operating strategies for DH systems. The model minimises the total operating cost of heat generation for a given DH system, which in this work is exemplified by the DH system of Göteborg, Sweden. The results should have important implications for operating strategies for DH systems as a response to future electricity price development. The results indicate significant changes in the operation of heat generation units in DH systems as a response to future electricity price profile with a, relative to today, high yearly average electricity price and more frequent high-electricity-price periods. The observed changes include a 20% decrease in heat generation from heat pumps (HP) and an increase of up to 25% in heat generation from combined heat and power (CHP) plants, owing to a switch in the merit order of these two technologies. We show that large fluctuations in the electricity price lead to an increased value being placed on CHP plants with variable power-to-heat ratio. The results indicate that with reoccurring high-electricity-price periods the value of sold electricity alone can become high enough to motivate investment in CHP plants, i.e. indicating that the generation and selling of heat from CHP plants may not be the core business in the future. Furthermore, there are additional opportunities for increased value of both CHP plants and HPs for time periods of less than 48 h, given that such short duration periods can be identified in a reasonable time in advance, i.e. dependent on, for instance, wind power forecasts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Combined heat and power (CHP); District heating (DH); Flexibility; Heat pumps (HP); Modelling; Optimisation,Cogeneration plants; Costs; Heat generation; Heat pump systems; Heating; Integer programming; Investments; Models; Wind power; Combined heat and power; District heating system; Electricity price fluctuation; Flexibility; Heat pumps; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimisations; Wind power forecast; District heating; business; combined heat and power; cost analysis; energy market; heat production; investment; linear programing; modeling; numerical model; operations technology; optimization; price dynamics; pump; wind power; Goteborg; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland; Chandipura virus

In this framework, there is a set of agents referred to as aggregators that participate in a real-time energy market by submitting offers to sell, or bids to buy, a certain amount of energy at some price. To realize an offer or a bid, an aggregator interacts with a set of DERs and incentivizes them to produce (or consume) energy via some pricing strategy. In order to make a decision on whether or not to sell or buy energy, each DER uses the pricing information provided by the aggregator it is associated with, and some estimate of the average (or total) energy that neighboring DERs are willing to sell or buy, computed through some exchange of information among them through a cyber network; the topology of this cyber network is described by a connected undirected graph. The focus of this paper is on the DER strategic decision-making process, which we cast as a game with a single aggregator. In this context, we provide sufficient conditions on the aggregator's pricing strategy under which this game has a unique Nash equilibrium. Then, we propose a distributed algorithm that enables the DERs to seek this Nash equilibrium; this algorithm relies on simple computations using local information acquired through exchange of information with neighboring DERs. We illustrate our results through several numerical simulations. © 2015 IEEE.",Distributed energy resources; Distributed generation control; Distributed Nash seeking; Networked systems,Computation theory; Costs; Decision making; Electric power distribution; Game theory; Networked control systems; Sales; Topology; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed Nash seeking; Exchange of information; Local information; Networked systems; Pricing strategy; Strategic decision making; Undirected graph; Energy resources

Some authors use this finding to state that the current subsidies for renewable technologies cannot be considered as excessive. By carrying out a hybrid analysis (both simulation and ex-post empirical analyses) of the case of photovoltaic energy in Italy, this article demonstrates that this result cannot be generalised. Under market power, an increase in PV production can provide benefits in terms of a wholesale price decrease only beyond a specific threshold and especially if combined with other effects. Otherwise, it is likely that PV development could imply an increase in prices. Therefore, on the one hand, caution is necessary when using the estimated change in wholesale prices to evaluate the net cost for consumers of the supporting policies for renewables: either the simulation-based models or the full empirical analyses may be misleading. On the other hand, if ""decarbonisation"" is the main objective, the energy policies should be designed in order to assure a deep and balanced penetration of the clean technologies, regardless of their estimated transitory impact on wholesale prices (and in the meantime reviewing the organisation of power markets). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity; Market power; Prices; Renewable,Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Electricity; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Market Power; Photovoltaic energy; Prices; Renewable; Renewable energy source; Renewable technology; Simulation-based models; Wholesale electricity; Costs; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; photovoltaic system; price dynamics; renewable resource; Italy

The cost-optimal scheduling of industrial loads with accurate price forecasts is therefore important. However, results in the current literature suggest that mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is poor at indicating the economic benefit of a forecast. This paper presents the economic benefit analysis of electricity price forecast on the day-ahead scheduling of load-shifting industrial plants. A coal-conveying system with storage is used as a case study. The research uses three price forecasting methods on the PJM's market prices over a period of two years. Rank correlation (RC) between the predicted price and the actual price is proposed as an indicator of economic benefit. The results show that RC is a better indicator of economic benefit than root mean square error (RMSE) and MAPE. They also show that potential economic benefit obtainable from forecasts depends on price volatility and not mean price. An artificial forecast is used to validate the superiority of RC over MAPE and RMSE. It is observed that the predictability of a forecast's economic benefit is largely dependent on how responsive the load is to electricity price changes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Conveyor belt system; Day-ahead scheduling; Demand-side management; Electricity cost optimization; Price forecast; Rank correlation,Belt conveyors; Coal storage; Costs; Electric utilities; Electricity; Forecasting; Industrial plants; Mean square error; Scheduling; Conveyor belt system; Day-ahead scheduling; Demand side managements; Electricity costs; Price forecasts; Rank correlation; Electric load forecasting

Wind forecast uncertainties and rules that penalize scheduling deviations often discourage wind energy producers from participating in day-ahead electricity markets. Instead, wind energy commonly is priced either in the real-time balancing market or via a Feed-in-tariff (FIT) arrangement. In this paper we extend a recently developed equilibrium modeling approach to examine how the integration of wind energy impacts premiums in day-ahead electricity markets. In particular, we compare premiums as wind power capacity expands for different pricing mechanisms. By considering operational costs related to ramping conventional generators we are able to characterize the efficient level of premium needed to cope with the intermittent nature of wind. We find that the way that wind energy is priced is critical. We show that in the presence of imperfect competition pricing wind energy in the market increases firms' ability to extract oversized day-ahead premiums while in the case of market-independent FIT, market power is reduced as wind power capacity expands. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Cournot competition; Day-ahead premium; Deregulated electricity markets; Feed-in-tariff; Wind energy,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Weather forecasting; Conventional generators; Cournot competition; Day-ahead; Day-ahead electricity market; Deregulated electricity market; Equilibrium modeling; Feed-in tariff; Imperfect competition; Wind power; competition (economics); cost-benefit analysis; deregulation; electricity supply; energy efficiency; numerical model; pricing policy; renewable resource; tariff structure; wind power

This variant employs two mathematical frameworks first an efficient sinusoidal truncated function and another one is oppositional based learning concept for ensuring the better exploration and exploitation properties.

As a flexible technology, it enhances reliability and security of the electricity system. However, climate change and market liberalization may hinder investment due to the evolution of water runoffs and electricity prices. Both alter expected revenue and bring uncertainty. It increases risk and deters investment. Our research assesses how climate change and market fluctuation affect annual revenue. But this paper focuses on the uncertainty, rather than on forecasting. This transdisciplinary topic is investigated by means of a mixed method, i.e. both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative approach uses established models in natural sciences and economics. The uncertainty is accounted for by applying various scenarios and various datasets coming from different models. Based on those results, uncertainty is discussed through an analysis discerning three dimensions of uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis requires the assessment of a large panel of models and data sets. It is therefore rarely carried out. The originality of the paper also lies on the combination of quantitative established models with a qualitative analysis. The results surprisingly show that the greenhouse gas scenarios may in fact represent a low source of uncertainty, unlike electricity prices. Like forecasting, the main uncertainties are actually case study related and depend on the investigated variables. It is also shown that the nature of uncertainty evolves. Runoff uncertainty goes from variability, i.e. inherent randomness, to epistemic, i.e. limitation of science. The reverse situation occurs with the electricity price. The implications for scientists and policy makers are discussed. © 2016, The Author(s).",Electricity market liberalization; Mixed methodology; Mountain hydrology; three-dimensional uncertainty,Climate change; Commerce; Costs; Economics; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Runoff; Flexible technologies; Market fluctuations; Market liberalization; Mixed methodology; Mountain hydrology; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative approach; Renewable energy source; Uncertainty analysis; alternative energy; climate change; commodity price; electricity industry; hydroelectric power; investment; renewable resource; runoff; uncertainty analysis

The electricity price classification method is as an alternative to numerical electricity price forecasting due to high forecasting errors in various approaches. These electricity price classifications are important because all market participants do not know the exact value of future prices in their decision-making process. In this paper, various electricity market price classification classes with respect to pre specified electricity price thresholds are used. The simulation results show that the proposed CFNN method provides a robust and accurate method for day-ahead deregulated electricity market price classification classes.

Using data on the United Kingdom over the last three hundred years, the paper identifies supply, aggregate demand and residual shocks to energy prices and estimates their changing influence on energy prices and GDP. The results suggest that the impacts of supply shocks rose with its increasing dependence on coal, and declined with its partial transition to oil. However, the transition from exporting coal to importing oil increased the negative impacts of demand shocks. More generally, the results indicate that improvements in vulnerability and resilience to shocks did not progress systematically as the economy developed. Instead, the changes in impacts depended greatly on the circumstances related to the demand for and supply of energy sources. If these experiences are transferable to future markets, a transition to a diversified mix of renewable energy is likely to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to energy price shocks. © 2017 The Authors",Demand shocks; Economic impact; Energy prices; Long run; Supply shocks,Costs; Economics; Demand shocks; Economic impacts; Energy prices; Long run; Supply shocks; Economic and social effects; demand elasticity; economic activity; economic development; economic impact; energy market; price dynamics; vulnerability; United Kingdom

The basic objective of the utility is to maximize the operational profit for a given period of time. Generation scheduling for a utility with wind farm largely depends on the accuracy of wind power prediction. Therefore, it is important to explore the suitability of load management approach in coordination with the use of energy storage facility to compensate the uncertainty in wind power generation. This paper focuses mainly the operating strategy of a grid connected small hybrid power system to maximize its profit by adopting coordination between load management technique and utilization of storage plant under frequency based pricing. The optimum load scheduling has been implemented to utilities own local load. An hourly-discretized optimization algorithm is proposed and solved using artificial bee colony algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the optimization problem is solved for varied wind power scenarios with different demand expectations cases in a day ahead Indian electricity market. It is noted that the proposed load management approach results more profit for the hybrid system because of better power management compared to the case when load scheduling has not been incorporated. The solution of the proposed optimization algorithm gives the strategies to be followed by the hybrid system how to operate its pump storage unit and to serve its local load in next hours. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We expect that increased connectivity yields additional supply in the short-term and therefore will reduce the impact of price spikes. Our results indicate that the impact of price spikes and volatility decreased over time, that prices behave more random, and that the parameter estimates between various connected markets seem to have converged between the Belgian, Dutch, French, German and Nordic day-ahead markets over the years 2003 through 2010.

We find that changes in relative energy prices have a statistically significant but very small impact on imports. On average, a 10% increase in the energy price difference between two country-sectors increases imports by 0.2%. The impact is larger for energy-intensive sectors.

Using the North American Mesoscale (NAM) Model, day-ahead global horizontal irradiance (GHI) forecasts are established and converted to power assuming that a 1. MW solar photovoltaic plant is co-located at each observation site. Using this forecast, energy is hypothetically sold in the DAM. As the RTM occurs, deviations between forecast and observation are settled by hypothetically purchasing or selling energy at the RTM price. Total revenue is calculated by the sum of these two transactions. Comparison of NAM forecast revenue to perfect day-ahead forecast revenue shows that perfect forecast revenue is always greater. However, yearly NAM forecast revenue is as much as 98% of the perfect forecast revenue for some sites. After a bias-correction is applied to NAM forecasts, NAM forecast revenue decreases. This demonstrates that based on the observed DAM-RTM price spread, biased forecasts can have a higher forecast value than more accurate forecasts. However, when a deviation penalty is assessed, the most accurate forecasts always yield the highest total revenue. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Energy market; Energy prices; Forecast value; Solar energy,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Solar energy; Bias correction; Day ahead market; Energy markets; Energy prices; Locational marginal prices; Production forecasts; Real-time market; Solar photovoltaic plants; Forecasting; accuracy assessment; economic analysis; energy policy; forecasting method; numerical model; photovoltaic system; pricing policy; real time; solar power; California; United States

The combinatorial clock (CC) auction has become very popular in these markets for its simplicity and for its highly usable price discovery, derived by the use of linear prices. Unfortunately, no equilibrium bidding strategies are known. Given the importance of the CC auction in the field, it is highly desirable to understand whether there are efficient versions of the CC auction providing a strong game theoretical solution concept. So far, equilibrium strategies have only been found for combinatorial auctions with nonlinear and personalized prices for very restricted sets of bidder valuations. We introduce an extension of the CC auction, the CCC auction, and show that it actually leads to efficient outcomes in an ex post equilibrium for general valuations with only linear ask prices. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the worst case efficiency of the CC auction, which highlights situations in which the CC leads to highly inefficient outcomes. As in other theoretical models of combinatorial auctions, bidders in the field might not be able to follow the equilibrium strategies suggested by the game-theoretical predictions. Therefore, we complement the theoretical findings with results from computational and laboratory experiments using realistic value models. The experimental results illustrate that the CCC auction can have a significant impact on efficiency compared to the CC auction. © 2013 INFORMS.",Allocative efficiency; Combinatorial auction; Electronic market,Clocks; Commerce; Costs; Allocative efficiency; Combinatorial auction; Computational analysis; Electronic market; Equilibrium bidding strategies; Laboratory experiments; Theoretical solutions; Worst-case efficiency; Game theory

Deregulated power markets differ in maximum vs. minimum daily average price and in average weekday to weekend price, in turn creating a different incentive for a consumer to time shift power consuming activities. Markets differ in the extent to which a small fraction of the days shapes the average diurnal pattern and value of price.

This paper endeavours to see whether a pool market achieves this goal of increasing competition and reducing electricity prices. Here the electricity market is set up as a sealed bid second price auction. Theory predicts that such markets should result with firms bidding their marginal cost, thereby resulting in an efficient outcome and lower costs to consumers. The Irish electricity system with a gross pool market experiences among the highest electricity prices in Europe. Thus, we analyse the Irish pool system econometrically in order to test if the high electricity prices seen there are due to participants bidding outside of market rules or out of line with theory.

We introduce a new methodology to predict long-term electricity market prices consisting of two parts: (1) a self-developed form of Porter’s five forces analysis (PFFA) determining that electricity markets are characterized by a fairly steady price increase. Dominant driving factors come out to be: (i) uncertainty of future electricity prices; (ii) regulatory complexity; and (iii) generation overcapacities. Similar conclusions derive from (2) a self-developed form of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). In this case, we find that the electricity market particularly depends on (i) market liberalization and (ii) the European Union (EU)’s economy growth. The applied methodologies provide a novel contribution in forecasting electricity price trends, by analyzing the sentiments, expectations, and knowledge of industry experts, through an assessment of factors influencing the market price and goals of key market participants. An extensive survey was conducted, interviewing experts all over Europe showed that the electricity market is subject to a future slight price increase. © 2018 by the authors.",Electricity market price; Europe; Forecast; Long term; Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Porter’s five forces analysis,Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Decision theory; Electric industry; Forecasting; Operations research; Power markets; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity prices; Europe; Forecasting electricity; Industry experts; Long term; Market liberalization; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Deregulation

In this market, changes in the offers of portfolio electricity technologies affect wholesale electricity prices, since marginal generation costs are transmitted through to the wholesale market. This paper investigates the impact of energy-based distributed generation technologies composition on wholesale electricity prices variations of different EU energy markets by using a Maximum Entropy Econometric estimation procedure.

Restructuring has brought about considerable changes by the virtue of which electricity is now a commodity and has converted into deregulated type. Such a competitive market has paved way for innumerable participants. This concept of restructuring has led to overloading of transmission lines. In this paper, power flow tracing has been employed by using suitable optimization algorithm, where the real power generation has been maximized. Congestion in the transmission line has been produced in a new fashion by maximizing the real power demand. The power flow under normal operating condition and congestion is determined and hence the difference in power flow is estimated. Based on the estimated power flow difference, the transmission line congestion cost is computed. Pool model and bilateral model has been considered in simulation study to introduce the concept of deregulation. The proposed method is tested and validated on Modified IEEE 30 bus test system and Indian utility 69 bus test system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, Australian coal prices Granger causes Chinese coal prices, and there is a high correlation between them. The U.S. electricity price is influenced by the WTI crude oil price, the U.S. gasoline price and the HenryHub gas price.

We therefore investigate producer behavior in the context of electricity pricing with respect to fundamental time-dependent marginal cost (TMC), i.e., CO 2- and fuel cost. In doing so, we do not-in contrast to most current approaches to market power investigation-rely on an estimate of the entire generation cost, which inevitably suffers from the lack of appropriate available data. Applying an analytical model of a day-ahead electricity market, we derive work-on rates, which provide information about the impact of TMC variations on electricity prices in the market constellations of perfect competition, quasi-monopoly, and monopoly. Comparing these model-based work-on rates with actual work-on rates, estimated by an adjusted first-differences regression model of German power prices on the cost for hard coal, natural gas, and emission allowances, we find evidence of the exercise of market power in the period 2006-2008. However, our results reveal that German market competitiveness increases marginally.

Our answer comprises the following findings that capture the interdependence of ERCOT's energy and AS products: (1) the DAM energy price increases with the day-ahead forecasts of natural gas price, system load and AS requirements but declines with nuclear and wind generation's forecasts; (2) the AS prices increase with the DAM energy price and the AS procurement forecasts but decline with the AS offer forecasts; and (3) the RTM energy price increases with the DAM energy price but diverges from the DAM energy price due to forecasting errors related to the DAM energy price's fundamental drivers. These findings imply that Texas can reduce the prices for day-ahead energy, day-ahead AS and real-time energy via wind generation development and demand-side-management. Further, Texas can improve its electricity trading efficiency by improving ERCOT's forecast accuracy to narrow the RTM energy price's divergence from the DAM energy price. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Ancillary services; D44; D47; Day-ahead market; Electricity products; ERCOT; G13; G14; Q41; Real-time market,Commerce; Costs; Dams; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Natural gas; Ancillary service; Day ahead market; Electric reliability council of texas; Electricity trading; ERCOT; Forecast accuracy; Real-time market; Wholesale electricity; Power markets; electricity generation; electricity supply; forecasting method; market conditions; price determination; real time; Texas; United States

Converse to the existing empirical literature in this area, we apply a panel data analysis to control for endogeneity due to unobserved heterogeneity. We use a dataset with 24 daily observations of day-ahead and intraday prices from 2010 to 2016, and we apply a fixed effects regression under consideration of robust Driscoll-Kraay standard errors. A noteworthy element of the regression model is the simulation-based design of a variable indicating the power generation technology that is price-determining at a certain point in time. In this context, we differentiate between the fuel types coal, gas, and others, to model the nonlinear price behavior for a varying demand. For 2016, we find price dampening effects of both wind and solar power of approximately 0.6 €/MWh per additional GWh of feed-in. Along with the rapidly increasing shares of wind and solar power of the total power generation during the last years, their price dampening effect has declined since 2013, due to a drop in fuel prices. Another finding is that a reduction in forecasting errors on the power generation from wind and solar, and smoothing of the cyclical demand would lead to a decreased price volatility. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Forecasting errors; Merit-order effect; Ramping costs; Renewable energy sources; Solar; Wind,Errors; Forecasting; Power markets; Regression analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind; Forecasting error; Ordering effects; Ramping costs; Renewable energy source; Solar; Costs; alternative energy; cost analysis; electricity generation; forecasting method; price dynamics; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Germany

To increase efficiency in the energy market, Mexican authorities approved a constitutional amendment aiming to open the state-run energy markets to competition in 2013. The reform is expected to raise efficiency and to lower energy prices in the long run. However, it will take some time for the new institutional arrangements to settle and the reform objectives to materialize. The removal of subsidies, which is expected to take place after the reform, will also raise prices particularly in the short run. In this paper, we analyze the effect of likely energy price changes due to energy market reform on household consumption and welfare in different income groups. We estimate the QUAIDS model using the nonlinear SURE method and the Mexican household budget surveys for the period 2002–2012 to obtain elasticities. The results show great heterogeneity in elasticities across energy types and income groups. Specifically, energy demand is elastic with respect to income, but changes in prices have mixed effects among energy types. The welfare effect of the price changes on low-income households will be 9 times stronger than that on the mid-income households and 18 times on and the high-income households.

Using multiple factors, different specifications and modern estimation techniques, these models have gained wide acceptance because of their success in accurately fitting the observed commodity futures' term structures and their dynamics. It is not well emphasized however that these models, in addition to providing the risk neutral distribution of future spot prices, also provide their true distribution. While the parameters of the risk neutral distribution are estimated more precisely and are usually statistically significant, some of the parameters of the true distribution are typically measured with large errors and are statistically insignificant. In this paper we argue that to increase the reliability of commodity pricing models, and therefore their use by practitioners, some of their parameters - in particular the risk premium parameters - should be obtained from other sources and we show that this can be done without losing any precision in the pricing of futures contracts.

This sensitivity matrix reflects a coupling among the sensor data, an estimation of the power system states, and the real-time LMP. The proposed framework offers system operators an online tool to: 1) quantify the impact of corrupted data at any sensor on LMP variations at any bus; 2) identify buses with LMPs highly sensitive to data corruption; and 3) find sensors that impact LMP changes significantly and influentially. It also allows system operators to evaluate the impact of SCADA data accuracy on real-time LMP.

Estimates of baseline time series models (SARMAX and SARMAX-EGARCH) and their forecasting performances suggest that the trend in natural gas prices, market power indicators, deterministic weekly patterns, perceived temperatures, persistence in conditional volatility, and the inverse leverage effect are essential features of the PUN dynamics. We then augment the best-performing models with dummies that account for changes in the market architecture, such as the introduction of contracts for differences (CfDs) to support renewables, trading of white certificates for energy efficiency, and the demand-side liberalization. The findings show that changes in the market architecture affected both the PUN level and its volatility. Specifically, wholesale electricity prices and volatility appear to have decreased upon the introduction of CfDs, only to be pushed upwards following the start of white certificates' trading and retail liberalization. Moreover, after controlling for reforms the inverse leverage effect vanishes, and the persistence in volatility is lower than in the baseline estimates. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity prices; Policy; Time series,Commerce; Energy efficiency; Natural gas; Public policy; Time series; Electricity prices; Essential features; Forecasting performance; Market architectures; Perceived temperature; Time series models; White certificates; Wholesale electricity; Costs; commodity price; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy market; forecasting method; liberalization; natural gas; retailing; time series analysis; Italy

Here, we show that further accuracy gains can be achieved when the explanatory variables (load forecasts) are deseasonalized as well. More importantly, considering a novel extension of the SCAR concept to probabilistic forecasting and applying two methods of combining predictive distributions, we find that (i) SCAR-type models nearly always significantly outperform the autoregressive benchmark but are in turn outperformed by combined SCAR forecasts, (ii) predictive distributions computed using Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) outperform those obtained from historical simulation and bootstrap methods, and (iii) averaging over predictive distributions generally yields better probabilistic forecasts of electricity spot prices than averaging over quantiles. Given that probabilistic forecasting is a concept closely related to risk management, our study has important implications for risk officers and portfolio managers in the power sector. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity spot price; Long-term seasonal component; Pinball score; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA); Risk management; Seasonal Component AutoRegressive (SCAR) model,Costs; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Risk management; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Auto-regressive; Electricity spot price; Long-term seasonal component; Pinball score; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile regression; Power markets; electricity supply; forecasting method; numerical model; probability; regression analysis; seasonality; time series analysis

The analysis covers a four-year period (2012–2015). Three multinomial logit models were designed, one for trade with each of western Denmark's (DK1) Nord Pool day-ahead spot market trading partners: eastern Denmark (DK2); southern Norway (NO2); and Stockholm, Sweden (SE3). It was found that both wind energy production and planned energy cross-border flow have a large effect on the probabilities of the pricing outcomes, with greater wind energy production in DK1 linked to lower prices in DK1 and lower wind energy linked to higher prices in DK1, although the effects varied considerably across trading partners. For example, if western Denmark's wind share of production was less than 33%, on average there was a 253% increase in the probability of DK1 having a higher price than NO2, and, in the SE3 model, this corresponding value was 359.8%, which encourages trading behavior to reduce the price differences. However, the existence of such large price differences suggests that interconnector transmission capacity or trading volume is not enough to balance the price in these circumstances. Overall, the results support the conclusion that increased interconnection can reduce price differences. © 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland",Europe; Market coupling; Nord Pool; Renewable energy; Wind energy,

From this model, we develop a multi-agent simulation to study the integration of the consumers’ flexibility into the system. Our study identifies the conditions that real-time prices may lead to higher electricity costs, which in turn contradicts the usual claim that such a pricing scheme reduces cost. We show that such undesirable behavior is in fact systemic. Due to the existing structure of the wholesale market, the predicted demand that is used in the formation of the price is never realized since the flexible users will change their demand according to such established price. As the demand is never correctly predicted, the volume traded through the balancing markets increases, leading to higher overall costs. In this case, the system can sustain, and even benefit from, a small number of flexible users, but this solution can never upscale without increasing the total costs. To avoid this problem, we implement the so-called “exclusive groups”. Our results illustrate the importance of rethinking the current practices so that flexibility can be successfully integrated considering scenarios with and without intermittent renewable sources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Balancing market; Day-ahead market; Demand response; Market design; Real-time pricing; Smart grid,Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Multi agent systems; Balancing market; Day ahead market; Demand response; Market design; Real time pricing; Smart grid; Costs; cost analysis; demand-side management; electricity; energy market; energy use; market conditions; market system; price determination; pricing policy; real time; simulation

In this approach, the stochastic programming is addressed in the upper level to study behavior of the retailer in the wholesale electricity market in presence of self-generation facilities, including thermal DGs, wind farms and roof-top photovoltaic (RPV) sites. Regarding increased penetration of RPV sites, a data dimension reduction technique through k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) methods is used to hedge against large-scale output power data of RPV sites. In addition, to forecast day-ahead power output of RPV sites, a similar-day detection (SDD) technique is addressed to investigate the impacts of climate variables, e.g. irradiation, sunshine hours and temperature, on 24-hour-ahead power of RPV sites. In the lower level problem, information gap decision theory (IGDT) is proposed to determine robustness of retail electricity price against uncertain clients’ consumption. In this way, robustness and opportuneness functions are discussed to evaluate immunity against failure and windfall reward, respectively. Finally, numerical results based on actual data from PJM market and North Carolina solar sites are presented to demonstrate the usefulness and proficiency of the proposed framework. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price; Retailer; Robust; Roof-top solar sites; Stochastic,

First, a single input and multi-output (SIMO) model for typical CHPs is established, considering the varying ratio between heat and electricity outputs at different loading levels. Then, the energy prices are forecasted with a gray forecasting model and revised in real-time based on the actual prices by using the least squares method. At last, a discrete optimization model and corresponding dynamic programming algorithm are developed to design the optimal operation strategies for CHPs in real-time. Based on the forecasted prices, the potential operating strategy which may produce the maximum profits is pre-developed. Dynamic modification is then conducted to adjust the pre-developed operating strategy after the actual prices are known. The proposed method is implemented on a 1 MW CHP on a typical day. Results show the optimized profits comply well with those derived from real-time prices after considering dynamic modification process. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Combined heat and power (CHP); Discrete optimization; Dynamic programming; Price forecasting; Real-time market,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Power markets; Profitability; Combined heat and power; Combined heat and power system; Deregulated energy market; Discrete optimization; Dynamic programming algorithm; Optimal operation strategy; Price forecasting; Real-time market; Dynamic programming

With this aim, we propose a new theoretical and empirical framework based on a heterogeneous agents model in which fundamentalists and chartists co-exist and are subject to regret and uncertainty. We find significant evidence that energy markets are composed of heterogeneous traders who behave differently depending on the intensity of the price fluctuations and the uncertainty context. In particular, energy prices are governed primarily by fundamental and chartist agents that are neutral to uncertainty during normal times, whereas these prices face irrational chartist investors averse to uncertainty during periods of extreme fluctuations. In this context, the recent surge in energy prices can be viewed as the consequence of irrational exuberance. Our new theoretical model is suitable for modeling energy price dynamics and outperforms both the random walk and the ARMA model in out-of-sample predictive ability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) withinthe International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

While this might be beneficial with respect to environmental quality, it also implies increasing electricity prices. The extent to which this is associated with negative impacts on employment depends on the interrelationship between labor and electricity as input factors in the production process. In this paper, we estimate cross-price elasticities between electricity and heterogeneous labor for the German manufacturing sector. We use administrative linked employer-employee micro-data combined with information on sector-level electricity prices and usage over the period 2003-2007. We find positive, but small conditional cross-price elasticities of labor demand with respect to electricity prices, which means that electricity as an input factor can be replaced by labor to a limited extent when the production level is held constant. In the case of adjustable output, we find negative unconditional cross-price elasticities, implying that higher electricity prices lead to output reductions and to lower labor demand, with low- and high-skilled workers being affected more than medium-skilled.

Traditionally, investigating the bivariate stochastic processes has been dominated by linear econometrical methods that proved helpful especially in finance. However, when dealing with intradaily power data, we cannot rely on models developed for financial or other commodity markets. Therefore, wavelet transforms are applied for power markets data to search for and decode nonlinear regularities and hidden patterns existing between the variables. Given its ability to decompose the time series into their time scale components and thus to reveal structure at different time horizons, wavelets are useful in analyzing situations in which the degree of association between processes is likely to change with the time-horizon. Therefore, a wavelet-based cross-analysis is performed between prices and trading volume time series. On the same basis, causality tests and out-of-sample forecasting tasks are carried out to empirically the strong relationship between the two investigated time series. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Electricity spot prices; European energy markets; Forecasting; Maximum overlapped discrete wavelet transform; Multiscale causality; Trading volume; Wavelet cross-correlation,

There are large disparities in energy prices within states when comparing residential and industrial prices although neoclassical economics predicts one price in markets. The large disparities between the two sectors across states negatively affects the efficiency of resource allocation, creates subsidies for those getting the cheap energy and results in unequal access to energy. These in turn lead to inefficient partitioning of energy between products and waste, higher pollution, leakage of wealth and poorer energy use efficiency, i.e. high energy intensity. States with large energy price disparities between sectors have statistically higher poverty, lower incomes, more pollution and use more energy but with less efficiency. Higher energy price disparities also result in higher throughput per unit of output thus reducing the chances for sustainability and lower public welfare. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Diversity; Energy; Energy intensity; Price disparity; Sustainability; Welfare,energy market; income; price dynamics; welfare economics

This novel method allows obtaining robust parameter estimates even when household expenditure surveys are limited, as is the case in many European countries. The empirical analysis is conducted both conditional on energy-related household characteristics and unconditionally. We then use the estimated demand system to conduct welfare analysis. We find that the rise in energy prices results in welfare losses of EUR 101 per household (in 2009 prices) in year 2020, or a nationwide welfare loss of more than EUR'2009 33 million. Price increases will be regressive and will affect small and urban households more strongly than the rest of the population. Furthermore, we find that the largest proportion of welfare loss is due to loss of household's income purchasing power caused by higher energy prices, while the changes in relative prices induce deadweight loss which is a small part of welfare loss because of the limited substitutability of energy with other goods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Climate policy; Deadweight loss; Demand system; Distributional effect,Climate policy; Demand system; Distributional effect; Empirical analysis; Energy and climate policies; European Countries; Household expenditure surveys; Preference heterogeneity; Cost accounting; Costs; demand analysis; energy market; energy policy; environmental policy; European Union; heterogeneity; household income; price dynamics; purchasing power parity; welfare economics; Cyprus

Energy price forecasting coupled with energy price-aware scheduling, is a step toward this goal. In this work, we study cost-aware schedules and the effect of various price forecasting schemes on the end schedule-cost. We show that simply optimizing price forecasts based on classical regression error metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error), does not work well for scheduling. Price forecasts that do result in significantly better schedules, optimize a combination of metrics, each having a different impact on the end-schedule-cost. For example, both price estimation and price ranking are important for scheduling, but they carry different weight. We consider day-ahead energy price forecasting using the Irish Single Electricity Market as a case-study, and test our price forecasts for two real-world scheduling applications: animal feed manufacturing and home energy management systems. We show that price forecasts that co-optimize price estimation and price ranking, result in significant energy-cost savings.

The effectiveness of imbalance prices as market signals is also examined, and policy recommendations regarding imbalance services are discussed. Two test cases are included that analyse the participation of a wind power producer in the Spanish electricity market using a stochastic optimisation strategy.

Deep discounts are welcomed, high Standing Offers are not. But price discrimination is unremarkable in economics. Indeed, in industries where fixed & sunk costs represent a significant portion of total cost, discriminatory pricing is usually welfare enhancing. Conversely, theory predicts and empirical evidence confirms that regulatory efforts to cherry-pick differential prices in asymmetric markets will damage consumer welfare. In this article, we analyse differential retail electricity offer prices in the Australian States of Victoria and Queensland and contrast these with industry average total cost and the marginal cost of retail supply. We find deregulated Victoria displays high price dispersion with Standing Offer tariffs 10% above industry average total cost and marginal offers at break-even prices (i.e. 20% below average total cost). In the semi-regulated Southeast Queensland market where a regulated price-cap exists, there is lower dispersion but marginal offers include a 6.7% retail mark-up.

Wind in particular has supply side effects when associated with substantial generating facilities, but also demand side influences when associated with extreme weather conditions. To unravel these effects, daily electricity prices and the weather variables wind, temperature and their interaction (wind chill) in the Central-West Europe coupled market were analysed from 2007 to the end of 2014 by means of vector autoregressions. The spillover effects were found to be quite subtle. Despite efficient price arbitrage, it is not the case that daily wind output shocks diffuse uniformly across all markets, or that the largest generator of wind energy creates the most significant spillovers or that high wind conditions necessarily lead to lower prices. Market specificities matter and are important for operational prediction and weather risk hedging. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity; Market integration; Prices; Weather; Wind energy,Costs; Electricity; Financial markets; Regression analysis; Weathering; Wind power; Electricity prices; Extreme weather conditions; Market integration; Operational predictions; Prices; Renewable energies; Spillover effects; Vector autoregressions; Commerce; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity supply; price dynamics; renewable resource; spillover effect; temperature; vector autoregression; weather; wind power; Europe

Therefore, this paper explores the effects of alternative energy price shocks on economic activity, and examines the relative performance of these alternative measures in predicting state level economic activity using the Davidson and MacKinnon J-test. The alternative energy price series considered are as follows: gasoline, diesel, natural gas, heating oil, and electricity. Alternative measures of energy price shocks produce different patterns of impulse responses than oil price shocks. Additionally, overwhelming evidence indicates that alternative energy price models, excluding models containing the price of gasoline, outperform the baseline model containing the price of oil for many states, particularly at short-to-mid forecast horizons. Using alternative energy prices should lead to a more accurate modeling of the energy price-macroeconomy relationship. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Economic activity; Energy price shock; Forecasting; Oil price shock; State level,Economics; Forecasting; Gasoline; Accurate modeling; Alternative energy; Economic activities; Energy price shocks; Oil price shocks; Primary energies; Relative performance; State level; Costs; economic activity; energy market; macroeconomics; oil production; price dynamics

An hourly-discretized optimization algorithm is proposed to identify the optimum daily operational strategy to be followed by the photovoltaic system, provided that a forecast for solar-power and load is available. This model is suitable to be applied in the real time operation of a typical house. The proposed strategy maximizes the individual revenue without shifting power demand.

With a meteorological model, time series of day-ahead wind forecasts were generated for the period 2006-2009, and these were compared with APX-ENDEX day-ahead market prices. Wind energy contributes to only 4% of electricity generation in the Netherlands, but was found to depress average day-ahead market prices by about 5%. With the help of the bid curves on the APX-ENDEX day-ahead market for 2009, a model was made to assess the impact of increasing levels of wind generation on power prices in the Netherlands. One of the main findings is that the future impact on prices will be less than in the past. With an increase of installed wind capacity from 2200 MW to 6000 MW, average day-ahead prices are expected to be depressed by an additional 6% in case no additional conventional generation is assumed. Taking into account existing government policy on wind and ongoing work on new conventional power plants, prices in 2016 will be only 3% lower due to wind. © 2011 IEEE.",,Bid curve; Conventional generation; Conventional power plants; Day ahead market; Day-ahead prices; Electricity generation; Electricity prices; Meteorological models; Netherlands; Power price; Wind capacity; Wind forecasts; Wind generation; Commerce; Electric generators; Electricity; Time series; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Costs

To manage risk and plan investment in generation assets, as well as to examine the efficient expansion of the current transmission grid, one needs to have a clear understanding of the interaction between the grid properties and the behaviour of the regional power markets. In this paper we discuss a fundamental modelling approach which extracts the stochastic properties of electricity prices by modelling the impact of physical and economic drivers affecting the production, delivery, and consumption of electricity. If the fundamental inputs are directly observable, we can use historical data to calibrate the model parameters. In the case of electricity, this simple and abundant set of training data can make a crucial difference. We present the bid-based stochastic model (BSM) and look into its application to valuing of financial derivatives, especially options based on the locational spread in electricity price between two markets. The advantage of the bid-based model is that one is able to link the capacity of the transmission line, in megawatts, directly to the correlation between electricity prices at the end nodes. This leads us to a valuation method for a locational spread option, the financial equivalent of a physical transmission right. The model represents an improvement over standard spread option formulation in that it accounts for the effect of the nonlinear flows in the transmission network on the correlation and distribution of locational prices. We also address the question of whether financial transmission rights can be replicated with a dynamic portfolio of forward contracts at the end nodes. This poses the possibility of model-based arbitrage between existing forward markets and the emerging transmission rights markets. Furthermore, it allows users to simulate the effect of transmission outages or expansion. For example, a for-profit transmission provider who is contemplating addition of a new transmission line between two markets needs to know whether he will be able to recover the fixed cost of investing in the line by selling transmission rights to market participants. By calibrating the bid-based model according to current price levels and adding the capacity of the new transmission line, the transmission owner can simulate future cash flows and estimate the profitability of the investment.",,

Many empirical analyses have been carried out to identify the mechanism behind this price reduction. However, studies on the price reduction mechanism of solar modules over the years have focused purely on the technological aspect of manufacturing. The purpose of this study is to consider the influence of economic and monetary factors such as the interest rate and exchange rate on solar module pricing in addition to other factors that considered in earlier studies including technology, wage rate and other energy prices. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, an oligopolistic model and econometric method are used to determine the economic factors that have an influence on solar module prices. The paper constructs a solar module pricing model and conducts a fully modified ordinary least squares analysis to estimate the influence of each factor. Analysis is conducted for the top five solar module producing countries in the world from 1997 to 2015. The five countries are the People’s Republic of China, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the USA. Findings: Empirical analysis provides several findings concerning the solar module pricing mechanism. These vary for each country. However, generally the interest rate has a positive correlation with solar module prices, while the exchange rate, knowledge stock and oil price have a negative correlation with solar module prices. Practical implications: First, the government must expand channels for renewable energy funding. As renewable industries are high-tech, the influence that capital cost has on technology price is significant. Government efforts to provide industries with low-interest finance will accelerate renewable business. There have been many attempts to lower interest rates for renewable energy technology to accelerate growth in the green technology market. Second, the government must expand research and development (R&D) expenditures focused on renewable energy technology. The technological advancements acquired through R&D enhance module performance efficiency, thereby reducing costs. Therefore, government policies aimed at increasing targeted R&D expenditure will be an effective means of expanding the installation of renewable energies. Originality/value: Studies on the price reduction mechanism of solar modules over the years have focused purely on the technological aspect of the manufacturing.

For both Canadian markets, the price movements reveal three types of correlated behavior which can be used for forecasting. The discovered scenarios remain the same on different time scales up to one month as well as for on- and off-peak electricity data. These scenarios represent sharp increases of prices and are not present in the Mid-C market due to its lower volatility. We argue that extreme price movements in this market should follow the same tendency as the more volatile Canadian markets.

We use ordinary least squares regression, quantile regression and autoregressive moving averages to identify these relationships using variables that have a quarter-hourly data granularity. The results show that higher wind and solar forecast errors increase the absolute values of imbalance volumes and that these can pass through into higher spot prices.

The selling prices of electricity for the customers are based on time-of-use (TOU) pricing which is widely employed in modern electricity market as a demand response program. The objective of the model is to maximize the expected profit of the retailer through optimizing the electricity procurement strategy and electricity pricing scheme. A price elasticity matrix (PEM) is adopted to model the demand response. Also, uncertainty in spot prices is modeled using a robust optimization approach, in which price bounds are considered instead of predicted values. Using a robust optimization approach, the retailer can adjust the level of robustness of its decisions through a robust control parameter.

The results show that both rising energy prices and shadow prices of energy have no significant effect on net employment when the manufacturing sectors only are analyzed. While finding significant variations across countries, the average employment effects become significantly positive once jobs in the economy as a whole are considered. This change is driven mainly by larger positive cost effects, which more than offset the negative demand effects and reductions in the positive factor-shift effects. Moreover, the paper reveals that the often implemented approach of using a simple regulation regressor, instead of decomposing the employment effect, can result in biased estimates. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Climate policy; Employment; Energy prices; Shadow prices,Employment; Biased estimates; Climate policy; Employment effects; Energy prices; Manufacturing sector; Negative demands; Regulatory effects; Shadow price; Costs; decomposition analysis; employment; energy market; environmental policy; implementation process; international comparison; regulatory approach

This study therefore proposes a two-stage approach for generating simulated price scenarios based on the available price data. The first stage consists of an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model for determining scenarios of cleared demands and scheduled generator outages (D&O), and a moment-matching method for reducing the number of D&O scenarios to a practical scale. In the second stage, polynomials are fitted between D&O and wholesale power prices in order to obtain price scenarios for a specified time frame. Time series data from the Midwest ISO (MISO) are used as a test system to validate the proposed approach. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach is able to generate price scenarios for distinct seasons with empirically realistic characteristics. ©2009 IEEE.",ARMA model; Moment-matching method; Restructured wholesale power markets; Scenario generation; Wholesale power prices,ARMA model; Moment-matching method; Restructured wholesale power markets; Scenario generation; Wholesale power prices; Commerce; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Method of moments; Power transmission; Time series; Electric load forecasting

This allows for computing spot-market revenues and imbalance penalties or gains for a wind power producer. Three different cases are evaluated: a perfect forecast, actual forecasting error distribution with median contracting and with 'optimal quantile' contracting. The optimal quantile is determined from the probability distribution of the random average wind power production and depends on price predictions for the spot and imbalance prices. The wind producer can use two down-regulating strategies to avoid being charged for excess energy during times when the surplus price becomes negative. The optimal quantile bidding combined with a strategy of down-regulating to contract level produces a comparable yearly revenue with that of an equivalent deterministic producer.

The model develops a small open economy in which households consume energy products and firms use energy as productivity inputs, where the country is so small that it needs to import energy, the price of which is determined abroad. Whereas positive energy price shocks cause an economic slowdown due to higher costs for consumers and firms, energy price volatility shocks generate an increase in GDP in the short-run and a reversal in the long-run. These findings are empirically supported by estimates from a Panel VAR model applied to 10 Asian economies, where energy price volatility has a positive impact on GDP in the short-run. Moreover, the paper finds that increasing demand or supply uncertainty also affect energy prices, with amplified fluctuations relative to a model that abstracts from energy. Market volatility leads households to cut consumption for precautionary savings motives, which in turn increases investment. Both energy price and uncertainty fluctuation lead to high macroeconomic volatility in the business cycle. Policy makers should encourage investment in energy security and renewable energy, such that households and firms would become less responding to fluctuations in the non-renewable energy market. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",C32 E21; DSGE model; E22; Energy price; F41; Panel VAR; Q43; Stochastic volatility; Uncertainty,Commerce; Costs; Energy policy; Energy security; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Value engineering; C32 E21; DSGE models; Energy prices; Panel vars; Stochastic volatility; Uncertainty; Investments; alternative energy; business cycle; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; energy market; energy policy; Gross Domestic Product; household energy; investment; macroeconomics; policy making; price dynamics; stochasticity

The UC participates in electricity supply chain management by a revenue sharing contract (RSC). In the electricity supply chain, the electricity real-time balance has an important role in the stable operation of the power system. Therefore, we introduce the demand response into the electricity supply chain to match supply with demand under forecast errors. Hence, we formulate a noncooperative game to characterize the interactions among the multiple competing UCs, which set the retail prices to maximize their profits. Besides, the UCs select their preferred contractual terms offered by the GC to maximize its profits and coordinate the electricity supply chain simultaneously. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) are examined, and an iterative algorithm is developed to obtain the NE. Furthermore, we analyze the RSC that can coordinate the electricity supply chain and align the NE with the cooperative optimum under the RSC. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model and the influence of market demand disruptions on the profits of the UCs, GC, and supply chain. © 2013 IEEE.",Electricity supply chain; load forecast errors; noncooperative game; pricing mechanism; revenue sharing contract (RSC),Binary alloys; Commerce; Contracts; Costs; Electric load management; Electric power generation; Electric power plant loads; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Game theory; Industry; Iterative methods; Power markets; Profitability; Supply chains; Uranium compounds; Electricity supply; Games; Load forecast; Load forecasting; Noncooperative game; Pricing mechanism; Revenue sharing contracts; Supply chain management

We consider a RTP that is determined by the forecasted generation and ramping cost. A community choice aggregator manages the load of all the consumers by setting the price. The consumer’s objective is to minimize their overall cost of consumption. Ancillary services are called upon to balance the load in real time. With zero RES in the power network and a high degree of load flexibility, the proposed RTP flattens and the volatility in demand vanishes. However, in presence of RES the volatility in price and demand is reduced up to an extent and ancillary services are required for load balancing. The amount of ancillary services required increases with forecast errors. We also propose a real time algorithm that approximates the optimal consumer behavior under the complete information setting.

Dynamic pricing, a straightforward implementation of demand response, may provide the means to manipulate the grid load thus extending the life expectancy of current technology. However, to integrate a dynamic pricing scheme in the crowded pool of technologies, available at demand side, a proper energy manager with the support of a pricing profile forecaster is mandatory. Although energy management and price forecasting are recurrent topics, in literature they have been addressed separately. On the other hand, in this work, the aim is to investigate how well an energy manager is able to perform in presence of data uncertainty originating from the forecasting process. On purpose, an energy and resource manager has been revised and extended in the current manuscript. Finally, it has been complemented with a price forecasting technique, based on the Extreme Learning Machine paradigm. The proposed forecaster has proven to be better performing and more robust, with respect to the most common forecasting approaches. The energy manager, as well, has proven that the energy efficiency of the residential environment can be improved significantly. Nonetheless, to achieve the theoretical optimum, forecasting techniques tailored for that purpose may be required. © 2015 IEEE.",Dynamic Price Forecasting; Energy Management; Extreme Learning Machine; Mixed-Integer Linear Programming; Neural Networks; Smart Micro Grid,Costs; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Forecasting; Houses; Integer programming; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Managers; Neural networks; Power markets; Current technology; Dynamic price; Extreme learning machine; Forecasting techniques; Mixed integer linear programming; Power distribution grids; Residential environment; Smart Micro Grids; Smart power grids

The cost of these losses would then be calculated based upon an expected, fixed per-kW h generation cost. This paper presents a more accurate means of calculating the cost of losses, using hourly feeder load information and time-varying electric energy cost data.

Previous works have examined consumer optimal policies for shifting time-flexible loads up to a deadline, in response to an exogenous and stochastic price process. It is shown here that under some mild assumptions on the stochastic price process and the information structure in the market, the individual consumer's optimal policy is a threshold policy. The threshold policy indicates that a consumer will consume only when the price falls below a certain threshold which depends on the time left to his deadline and the information on the price process. This behavior by individual consumer leads to an aggregate behavior by a large number of consumers who implement threshold policies in reaction to the price process; although at each instant of time, different consumers may have different thresholds due to different deadlines and different information assumptions. The aggregate response from the consumers determines the state of the wholesale market, and thus, affects the price process. The question that we intend to answer in this paper is that of consistency of assumptions on the price process and the market outcomes. It is assumed that the price at each time interval is determined by the Independent Service Operator (ISO) on the basis of an estimate of the global consumption as a function of price. It is shown that under technical regularity assumptions on the model components, the price distribution has at least one equilibrium point. Thus, there exists at least one price process that is consistent both with the consumption behavior of the aggregate of consumers who individually implement threshold policies, and the marginal cost pricing mechanism of the ISO. © 2012 IEEE.",,Aggregate behavior; Energy markets; Equilibrium point; Equilibrium price; Global consumption; Information structures; Marginal-cost pricing; Market outcomes; Model components; Optimal policies; Price process; Real time pricing; Regularity assumption; Threshold policies; Time interval; Wholesale markets; Aggregates; Commerce; Costs; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Consumer behavior

Under the assumption of more efficient energy provision which benefits customers a large number of former energy monopolists have been privatized in line with the liberalization of energy markets in Germany at the end of the 1990s. However, current re-municipalizations are justified by similar arguments in the public debate. Based on a dataset on the ownership structure of energy providers we find that public property or private property itself is not the decisive factor for lower retail and wholesale prices. Rather, a high ownership concentration leads to low prices, regardless of the type of owner. As public investors often seek total ownership of a provider, households, which are less willing to switch, benefit at least indirectly from public ownership. Tests for robustness of our results applying different owner and concentration measures confirm the results independently from the underlying estimation specification. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Ownership structure; Strategic price-setting; Vertical ownership relation,Concentration measures; Data sets; Energy markets; Germany; In-line; Ownership structure; Price setting; Private property; Public debate; Public investors; Public ownership; Strategic price-setting; Vertical ownership relation; Whole sale prices; Privatization; Sales; Costs; energy efficiency; energy market; liberalization; ownership; price determination; public sector; retailing; Germany

One possibility is for the market coordinator to communicate iteratively with market participants to determine energy prices, on a receding horizon basis. Until now, little work has been carried out on the practicalities of implementing such pricing mechanisms, and yet because a market outcome must be cleared in real time, adequate communication speed and reliability is essential. The authors present a model of lossy and delayed communication over a network for such a negotiated pricing mechanism, derived from practical consideration of message timing, collection strategies and security. The convergence of the algorithm to an optimal dispatch is shown to be quite robust to frequent communication failures and delays.

This paper analyzes the financial impact of this uncertainty in terms of the costs of redispatch. The analysis uses an optimal power flow (OPF) model in a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) framework to estimate these cost impacts as the difference in production cost and system lambda from a base case dispatch. Using a range of wind generation, reserve margins and assumptions for the ramp capability of non-wind generators, the results from the OPF and MCS show that wind power forecast uncertainty combined with load uncertainty can increase the variability in production cost for situations where moderate wind and load are expected, and will increase the variability in system lambda for the situation where low wind output and high load are expected. The results also show that on average there are few voltage violations. © 2010 IEEE.",Electricity markets; Interruptible load; Monte Carlo Simulation; Wind power generation,Cost impact; Demand uncertainty; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Financial impacts; Forecast errors; High load; Interruptible load; Load uncertainty; Monte Carlo Simulation; Optimal power flows; Power systems; Production cost; Real time; Redispatch; System operator; Voltage violation; Wind generation; Wind generators; Wind power forecast; Computer simulation; Cosmic ray detectors; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Monte Carlo methods; Ramp generators; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Electric load forecasting

Hence, in addition to the concept drift, classification problems in streaming data environments are inherently imbalanced. However, streaming imbalanced and concept drifting problems in the power system and smart grid have rarely been studied. Incremental learning aims to learn the correct classification for the future unseen samples from the given streaming data. In this paper, we propose a new incremental ensemble learning method to handle both concept drift and class imbalance issues. The class imbalance issue is tackled by an imbalance-reversed bagging method that improves the true positive rate while maintains a low false positive rate. The adaptation to concept drift is achieved by a dynamic cost-sensitive weighting scheme for component classifiers according to their classification performances and stochastic sensitivities. The proposed method is applied to a case study for the electricity pricing in Australia to predict whether the price of New South Wales will be higher or lower than that of Victorias in a 24-h period. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with statistical significance in comparison to the state-of-the-art incremental learning methods. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity pricing; imbalanced classification; incremental Learning,Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Learning systems; Personnel training; Power markets; Bagging; Electricity pricing; Imbalanced classification; Incremental learning; Sensitivity; Smart grid; Smart power grids

Furthermore, this is the first empiric study estimating impacts of wind generation on electricity price that utilizes a comprehensive set of predictor variables to control for many sources of potential bias. The results show a statistically significant impact of wind generation on real-time hourly MISO system prices, ranging from an estimated decrease of $0.14 to $0.34 per mega-watt hour, for each 100 mega-watt hours of additional wind generation. It is observed that the estimated marginal impacts of additional wind generation have declined over time. This is likely attributable to the long-term shifts in the supply and demand dynamics experienced in the MISO energy market, as well as to changes made to the MISO market structure to better accommodate variable generation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Energy economics; Wind energy,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Natural gas; Power markets; Wind power; Electricity prices; Empirical investigation; Energy economics; Independent system operators; Real-time electricity prices; Variable generations; Wholesale electricity; Wholesale electricity markets; Electric power generation; econometrics; electricity; empirical analysis; energy market; historical record; natural gas; power generation; price dynamics; resource economy; wind power; United States

We study the behaviour of the UK energy and non-energy intensive sectors firms in a real business cycle (RBC) model using unfiltered data. The model is econometrically estimated and tested by indirect inference. Output contraction during the Great Recession was largely caused by energy price and sector-specific productivity shocks, all of which are non-stationary and hence tend to dominate the sample variance decomposition. We also found that the channel by which the energy price shock reduces output in the model is via the terms of trade: these fall permanently when world energy prices increase and as substitutes for energy inputs are strictly limited there are few reactions via production channels. Therefore, there is no other way to balance the deteriorating current account than through lower domestic absorption. © 2018",Energy price shock; Great Recession; Output; Productivity shock; RBC; Unfiltered data,Productivity; Energy price shocks; Great Recession; Indirect inference; Output; Production channels; Specific productivity; Terms of trades; Unfiltered data; Costs; business cycle; data set; econometrics; energy market; price determination; productivity; United Kingdom

The purpose of the present research is to estimate the impact on the final prices of the interconnection of the two largest electrical systems in Chile. To this end, an econometric model is used in which prices, among other variables, are explained by the level of marginal costs in the system (opportunity cost), the degree of concentration in the market (market power), and the variability of marginal costs projected by the agents (risk). The data corresponds to bilateral contracts between generators and major clients, from 2006 to 2014. The basic results indicate that the interconnection would benefit final customers by reducing equilibrium contract prices, as a result of the decreased variability of expected marginal costs and a lower concentration of existing generating companies.

We focus on the Spanish market due to the high penetration of wind and hydro, and also the availability of data on water stored in Spanish dams. We estimate the impact of wind generation and hydro availability on the electricity price level and volatility through an ARX-GARCHX model. The results show that these two different renewables have different impacts on electricity prices: intermittent wind generation increases the price volatility, while dispatchable hydro reduces it. The results are consistent with hydropower plants behaving strategically and, given their zero marginal cost, dampening the otherwise higher price increases due to wind intermittency. Therefore, hydropower complements other intermittent renewables, not only operationally, but also economically. © 2017 IEEE.",,Commerce; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Power markets; Electricity prices; Hydropower plants; Intermittent renewables; Large-scale deployment; Price volatility; Renewable energies; Wholesale electricity; Wind generation; Costs

This is due to the fact that the fluctuations are nonlinear and extremely complex. Recent years have witnessed the study of this type of complex systems with powerful tool involving fractal methodology. This paper reports for the first time in Indian scenario a study on the fluctuation pattern of biding price of power in five different bid areas of India with a robust and rigorous technique based on chaos and fractal behavior. The exhaustive study reveals very interesting patterns of the fluctuation process, namely in all domains, the fluctuations are multifractal in time and degree of multifractality is quite different in different zones. The data is completely new and has serious implications on product cost of industry and ultimately on stock price indices.

The typical approach employed by such companies to address their mid- and long-term optimal contracting strategy is to simulate a large set of paths for the uncertainty factors to characterize the probability distribution of the future income and, then, optimize the company portfolio to maximize its certainty equivalent. In practice, however, spot price modeling and simulation is a big challenge for agents due to its high dependence on parameters that are difficult to predict, e.g., GDP growth, demand variation, entrance of new market players, regulatory changes, just to name a few. Under this framework, decisions are made under ambiguity, which happens whenever the decision maker is aware that a given set of scenarios and probabilities represent only an approximation of the true underlying distribution. In this work, robust optimization is used to account for ambiguity aversion in the optimal contracting strategy of renewable generation companies. A case study with data from the Brazilian system is shown to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.",Ambiguity Aversion; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Forward and Capacity Contracts; Hybrid Robust and Stochastic Optimization; Power System Economics; Price-Quantity Risk; Renewable Generation,Costs; Decision making; Economics; Optimization; Value engineering; Ambiguity aversion; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Power system economics; Renewable generation; Stochastic optimizations; Probability distributions

Due to the high forecast error and inter-temporal variability of renewable resources (e.g., wind and solar), many system operators are in the process of upgrading their market clearing engine from static economic dispatch-based ones to dynamic look-ahead economic dispatch-based ones. Compared with conventional static dispatch that calculates the optimal dispatch for the current operating interval, look-ahead dispatch calculates the optimal dispatch solution over multiple future time intervals. Look-ahead dispatch can obtain cost saving by pre-ramping some of the dispatched generators so that the system can more economically match forecast changes in net load (i.e., system load - renewable power output). In addition to the cost saving benefit, system operators in RTOs claim that look-ahead dispatch results in lower price volatility than static dispatch. In this paper, we attempt to demystify this industry claim and provide counterexamples to this claim. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between price volatility and some key factors such as system-wide ramping capability, the number of time intervals in look-ahead dispatch horizon, load pattern and forecast uncertainty. The simulation results are illustrated with numerical examples in the IEEE 14-bus system. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.",Electricity market; locational marginal price; look-ahead economic dispatch,Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Power markets; Scheduling; Economic Dispatch; Electricity market; Forecast uncertainty; Locational marginal prices; Market clearing engines; Price volatility; Renewable resource; Temporal variability; Electric load forecasting

The constraints are power balanced equations and system operating limits. The algorithm assumed a constant forecasted real power demand and no bilateral contracts. The hybrid computational method decomposes the calculations into two parts: the market dispatch part; and the power flow dispatch part. The bidding prices and the amount of power willing to produce are submitted from generators in form of several bidding blocks. The market dispatch part gives the results in terms of allocation of the bids of real power generations at each bus based only on the price offered without considering physical limits of the power systems. The power flow dispatch part minimizes the changes of real power generations resulting from the market dispatch part while satisfying power flow and necessary limits. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 30 bus system. Four interesting case studies have been illustrated with satisfying results. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.,Bidding price; Electricity market; Hybrid computational method; Optimal power flow,

In this paper, an accurate feed-forward neural network model with a genetic optimization Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation training algorithm is employed for short-term nodal congestion price forecasting in different zones of a large-scale power market. The use of genetic algorithms for neural network training optimization has a remarkable effect on the accuracy of price forecasting in a large-scale power market. The necessary data for neural network training are obtained by solving optimal power flow equations that take into account all effective constraints at any hour of the day in a single month. The structure of the neural network has 2 input signals of active and reactive powers for every load busbar in every hour of the programming model. These 2 signals are always available. In this study, an IEEE 118-bus power system is used to test the proposed method authenticity. This system is divided into 3 zones, and a neural network with genetic algorithm training optimization is employed for every zone. Performance of the proposed method is compared with ARIMA and GARCH time series for the same data. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is robust, efficient, and accurate.

However, improvements in the methodology for area price determination and congestion management are needed to make this model suitable for the more meshed and complex power system in central Europe. Alternative methodologies have been proposed where power flow calculations are included, and the main purpose of this paper is to present a simulation model which can be used to assess alternative methods for congestion management. The paper describes a simulation model where the Flow Based Market Coupling method is implemented and demonstrated. This method can be seen as a compromise between nodal pricing and market splitting (area pricing), where the criterion for congestion management is minimization of the Socio-economic Congestion Cost. The main principles for the proposed model are described, and case studies are performed on a generic system model in order to highlight the main characteristics of the method, and to summarise the main benefits and challenges that remain for a practical implementation of the Flow Based Market Coupling method. The case studies show that the method has the potential to solve the congestion management problem in a way that is optimal from a socio-economic point of view. The total costs of congestions are minimized, and the maximum differences in area prices are normally reduced. As a consequence the transmission system utilization is improved and the market players' risk referred to area prices is reduced. However, a successful implementation of the method depends heavily on the power flow model that is applied. It is of vital importance that this model is sufficiently accurate and continuously updated to predict the actual power flows on the main cross-border transmission corridors. © 2005 IEEE.",Congestion Management; Day ahead Market; Flow Based Market Coupling; Market Splitting; Power Exchange,Computer simulation; Cost effectiveness; Electric power systems; Electricity; Marketing; Optimization; Risk management; Congestion Management; Day ahead Market; Flow Based Market Coupling; Market Splitting; Power Exchange; Electric power distribution

The market clearing problem is formulated by the independent system operator (ISO) to coordinate the electric power system with the district heating system by considering time-delay effects in the heating transfer process. GLMP is explained as the shadow price related to the nodal electricity balance and nodal heat balance at the optimal solution. Without considering network constraints, a simplified market clearing problem is proposed to illustrate the price linkage between heating and electricity markets through combined heat and power joint costs and feasible regions. Rational generation units will behave exactly as the ISO predicts by maximizing their individual producer surplus. Then, a compact form of the complete market clearing problem is employed to derive the detailed components of GLMP, namely, the extended marginal generation component, marginal loss component, and marginal congestion component. Furthermore, time-delay effects are reflected in the pricing.

To model this, we consider a spatial equilibrium model of price formation, where constraints on inter-regional flows result in three distinct equilibria in prices. We use this to motivate an econometric model for the distribution of observed electricity spot prices that captures many of their unique empirical characteristics. The econometric model features supply and inter-regional trade cost functions, which are estimated using Bayesian monotonic regression smoothing methodology. A copula multivariate time series model is employed to capture additional dependence — both cross-sectional and serial — in regional prices. The marginal distributions are nonparametric, with means given by the regression means. The model has the advantage of preserving the heavy right-hand tail in the predictive densities of price. We fit the model to half-hourly spot price data in the five interconnected regions of the Australian national electricity market. The fitted model is then used to measure how both supply and price shocks in one region are transmitted to the distribution of prices in all regions in subsequent periods. Finally, to validate our econometric model, we show that prices forecast using the proposed model compares favorably with those from some benchmark alternatives. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian monotonic function estimation; Copula time series model; Intraday electricity prices,Commerce; Cost functions; Electric power system interconnection; Power markets; Time series; Australian national electricity markets; Electricity prices; Empirical characteristics; Monotonic functions; Multivariate time series models; Spatial equilibrium models; Time series modeling; Wholesale electricity markets; Costs; Bayesian analysis; econometrics; electricity supply; energy market; estimation method; numerical model; price dynamics; time series analysis; Australia

Meanwhile, electricity generation portfolio with respect to market participants and primary energy resources as well as price forecasts can be obtained simultaneously.

Exploiting the System Generalized Methods of Moments estimation technique for the period spanning 2002–2015, the results indicate that the overall effect of energy prices on economic growth is significantly negative. This effect propagates mainly through government consumption expenditure and investment, albeit its effect through real interest rate is positive.

Intentional islanding enables the use of distributed energy resources (DERs) to power critical loads and accelerate grid restoration. In this study, an innovative dynamic microgrid islanding scheme was investigated as a means of enhancing distribution grid resilience. If customers in a dynamic microgrid request emergency electricity services during an outage, the question of how the distribution system operator should price the DER emergency power service arises. To answer this question, an economic load dispatch model was implemented in a single-bid auction market to forecast the market-clearing price of electricity in the dynamic microgrid island. The results show that the cost of emergency service is impacted by the power supply and demand in the island. When the combined heat and power plant capacity of the dynamic microgrid exceeded the demand, the market-clearing price of electricity in the island could be even less than the on-grid electricity price during normal periods. Thus, the dynamic microgrid scheme provides a low-cost means of supplying end-users with emergency power. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Distributed energy resources; Dynamic microgrid; Economic load dispatch; Electricity pricing; Intentional islanding,Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Costs; Distributed power generation; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Emergency services; Energy policy; Energy resources; Outages; Distributed Energy Resources; Economic load dispatch; Electricity pricing; Intentional islanding; Micro grid; Electric load dispatching; distribution system; electricity supply; energy market; energy resource; pricing policy

Persistent regional price differences due to Indonesia's insular geography enable this study to show that energy prices have a small (but statistically significant) adverse long-run effect on competitiveness – though different energy types matter in different sectors. By estimating cross and own price elasticities and Uzawa-Allen partial elasticities of (inter-fuel) substitution, this study also shows that firms have the ability to respond to higher energy prices by adjusting their energy mix, i.e. substituting certain energy goods for others. Moreover, this study shows that firms also respond to higher energy prices by increasing energy efficiency, and by passing on costs to end-users. Nevertheless, these response measures are not sufficient to fully mitigate the adverse effect of energy prices on firms.

We consider the case where the false status of circuit breakers (CBs) that bypass topology error processing can generate an incorrect power system network topology, subsequently distorting the results of the state estimation and economic dispatch. The main goal of this paper is to assess the economic impact of this misconfigured network topology on real-time LMP in an entire power system with network congestion. To this end, we start with our prior result, a simple and analytical congestion price equation, which can be applied to any single line congestion scenario. This equation can be extended to better understand the degree to which the LMP at any bus changes due to any line status error. Furthermore, it enables a rigorous analysis of the relationship between the change in LMP at any bus with respect to any line error and various physical/economical grid conditions such as the bidding prices for marginal generators and the locations of the congested/erroneous lines. Numerical examples on the impact analysis of this topology error are illustrated in IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems. © 2017, The Author(s).",Economic dispatch; Locational marginal price; Power market; Power system network topology,Commerce; Costs; Electric circuit breakers; Electric power transmission networks; Errors; Location; Numerical methods; Power markets; Scheduling; Topology; Economic Dispatch; Line congestions; Locational marginal prices; Network congestions; Power system networks; Real time power market; Rigorous analysis; Topology error processing; Electric load dispatching

Based on this concept, a new optimization formulation has been proposed to develop bidding strategy of such buyers considering Price Responsive Demand Shifting (PRDS). Since the bidding strategy of the buyer depends upon the market clearing price, which is volatile/uncertain due to various factors like gaming behavior of participants, demand forecasting error, transmission congestion etc, the proposed optimization problem is formulated as a stochastic linear problem, comprising of two sub-problems. The first sub-problem represents the market clearing process by the System Operator, which is formulated to maximize the social welfare of the market participants, while the second sub-problem aims at maximizing the purchase cost saving of the industrial buyer. The optimal bidding strategy has been obtained by solving these two sub-problems considering hourly market clearing for 24-hour scheduling period. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested on a 5-bus system and modified IEEE 30-bus system. Results obtained with the demand shifting based bidding strategy have been compared with those obtained with a Conventional Price Quantity (CPQ) bid strategy. It has been observed that the proposed approach leads to enhancement in the purchase cost saving as compared to the CPQ and meets the energy consumption targets of the industrial buyer. © 2017 by De Gruyter 2017.",electricity market; optimal bidding strategy; price responsive demand shifting; stochastic linear optimization; uniform market clearing price,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Linear programming; Optimization; Production control; Sales; Stochastic systems; Day-ahead electricity market; Linear optimization; Market Clearing Price; Optimal bidding strategy; Optimization formulations; Price responsive demand; Price responsive demand shifting; Transmission congestion; Power markets

AC load flow and non-linear distribution cost modeling needed to this end, render centralized market clearing Algorithms intractable, with Distributed Proximal Message Passing (PMP) Algorithms offering what appears to be the only scalable and tractable alternative. DLMPs of real and reactive power are associated with equality power balance constraint shadow prices at each distribution node, while, allowable voltage limit inequality constraints are associated with inequality constraint shadow prices. This paper addresses the slower convergence rate of voltage constraint shadow price estimates in PMP algorithms. In particular, we use first order optimality conditions to derive relations that characterize the interaction of equality and inequality shadow prices across the distribution network, and employ them to construct a filter that enhances the estimation accuracy of voltage inequality constraint shadow prices. We show that use of this filter results in a significant speedup of the PMP algorithm's convergence rate for both voltage shadow prices as well as DLMPs. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,

The proposed model does not predict the exact value of future electricity price, but the class to which it belongs, established with respect to pre-specified threshold. This strategy is proposed since for some applications, the exact value of future prices is not required for the decision-making process. A feature selection technique is applied to identify the relevant attributes to the decision tree. Some decision tree algorithms are investigated such as CART and C5.0. These results are compared with NN, another classification technique commonly used. In addition, ensemble models combining CART, C5.0 and NN two by two are analyzed. The prediction time horizon is 1 week ahead and the system used is the Brazilian market, which adopts a cost-based centralized dispatch with unique characteristics of price behavior. The results show that an ensemble model of C5.0 and CART produced high accuracy of 99.3%, and can be an attractive tool to mitigate risks in purchasing power. © 2015 IEEE.",classification; decision tree; electricity price forecasting; feature selection,Algorithms; Classification (of information); Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Power markets; Classification models; Classification technique; Decision making process; Decision-tree algorithm; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Prediction time horizon; Selection techniques; Data mining

In the base regime, there is no congestion and the price in Sicily (which equals the systemmarginal price) depends on national electricity demand and RE supply. In the congested regime, the Sicilian price depends on the local electricity demand and RE supply, as well as on market power by local generators. The transition between regimes is modeled through a dynamic probit, including, as explanatory variables, the RE supply on both sides of the potentially congested line. The regime switching model is estimated using hourly data from the Italian dayahead electricity market for the year 2012. As shown by results, congestion is determined by the total amount of renewables in mainland Italy, but when the RE supply is disaggregated into different sources, one finds that congestion is mainly due to photovoltaics (from the peninsula) and hydropower (wherever located), whereas wind power has a negative effect on congestion regardless of localization. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,Commerce; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Photovoltaic effects; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Electricity demands; Electricity prices; Explanatory variables; Italian day-ahead electricity markets; Italian peninsula; Regime switching model; Renewable energies; System marginal price; Stochastic models

A risk-neutral producer seeks to maximize the expectation of its random profit from conventional and renewable energy sales, under the predictive probability distributions of wind power production, day-ahead spot price and imbalance prices for surplus and deficit production. Our main result is a price-quantity curve, which the producer should submit in the day-ahead bidding process.

Here we show that pooling wind and conventional resources yields strictly higher expected revenues than separate operation. Essentially, the expensive fossil-fuelled units are used only as backup for wind energy shortages, while bidding from renewable sources becomes more aggressive in the presence of conventional back-up that can insulate from imbalance penalties. We validate this new method by computing and comparing yearly revenues for a mixed portfolio producer typical of the Netherlands, using data from the day-ahead market operated by the Amsterdam Power Exchange and the imbalance market run by the Dutch system operator TenneT.",Energy markets; Forecasting; Imbalance pricing; Optimization under uncertainty; Wind energy,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Day ahead market; Energy markets; Optimal bidding strategy; Optimization under uncertainty; Renewable energy sales; Renewable resource; Renewable sources; Wind power production; Power markets

Thereby, the fading of the classical producer–consumer division to a broader prosumer “concept” is fostered. This crucial transition will tackle environmental harms associated with conventional energy sources, especially in this age where a greater concern regarding sustainability and environmental protection exists. The “smoothness” of this transition from a reliable conventional generation mix to a more volatile and “parti-colored"" one will be particularly challenging, given escalating electricity demands arising from transportation electrification and proliferation of demand-response mechanisms. In this foreseeable framework, proper Hybrid Energy Systems sizing, and operation strategies will be crucial to dictate the electric power system’s contribution to the “green” agenda. This paper presents an optimal power dispatch strategy for grid-connected/off-grid hybrid energy systems with storage capabilities.

We extend the Student’s t and the exponential generalised beta distribution of the second kind stochastic location and stochastic seasonal DCS models. We consider the generalised t distribution as an alternative for the error term and also consider dynamic specifications of volatility. We use a unique dataset of spot electricity prices for El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama. We consider two data windows for each country, which are defined with respect to the liberalisation and development process of the energy market in Central America. We study the identification of a wide range of DCS specifications, likelihood-based model performance, time-series components of energy prices, maximum likelihood parameter estimates, the discounting property of conditional score, and out-of-sample forecast performance. Our main results are the following. (i) We determine the most robust models of energy prices, with respect to parameter identification, from a wide range of DCS specifications. (ii) For most of the cases, the in-sample statistical performance of DCS is superior to that of the standard model. (iii) For El Salvador and Panama, the standard model provides better point forecasts than DCS, and for Guatemala the point forecast precision of standard and DCS models does not differ significantly.

Ten minutes averaged wind data are obtained from LIDAR over the period of twelve months and it is compared with the 38 years' data from weather station with the objective of determining the wind resources at the wind-farm. The performance of one of the wind turbines located in the wind-farm is assessed by comparing the wind power potential of the wind turbine with its actual power production. Our analysis shows that the wind farm under study is rated as 'good' in terms of wind power production and has wind power density of 479 W/m2. The annual wind-farm's income is estimated based on the real-data collected from the wind turbines. The effect of price of electricity and the spot prices of Norwegian-Swedish green certificate on the income will be illustrated by means of a Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) approach.

We propose a multivariate model of volatility that decomposes volatility multiplicatively into a non-stationary (e.g. periodic) part and a stationary part with log-GARCH dynamics. Since the model belongs to the log-GARCH class, the model is robust to spikes or jumps, allows for a rich variety of volatility dynamics without restrictive positivity constraints, can be estimated equation-by-equation by means of standard methods even in the presence of feedback, and allows for Dynamic Conditional Correlations (DCCs) that can – optionally – be estimated subsequent to the volatilities. We use the model to study the hourly day-ahead system prices at Nord Pool, and find extensive evidence of periodic volatility and volatility feedback.

We begin by showing that the use of oil prices as a proxy for more general energy price dynamics is not appropriate for the case of China. Having established this fact, we propose a new energy price index which accurately reflects the structure of China's energy expenditure shares, and intertemporal fluctuations in international energy prices. We then employ a sufficiently rich set of time varying VARs, identified through a new set of agnostic sign restrictions, to estimate the effects of energy price shocks on China's macroeconomy. Our main result is that positive energy price shocks generate statistically significant reductions in real GDP growth and increases in inflation. Interestingly, both the sets of responses have consistently declined over the sample period. Next, the interest rate responses are found to be consistently positive over the sample period. Given the aforementioned stagflation result, this suggests that the PBOC is more focused on inflation stabilization as compared to facilitating output growth. All presented results are shown to be robust under both official national data and those developed by Chang et al. (2015), thus strengthening our conclusion that energy price shocks have significant time varying effects on China's macroeconomy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",China; Energy prices; Sign restrictions; Stochastic volatility; Time varying parameters,Economic analysis; Stochastic systems; China; Energy prices; Sign restrictions; Stochastic volatility; Time varying parameter; Costs; energy market; expenditure; Gross Domestic Product; inflation; interest rate; macroeconomics; oil supply; parameterization; price dynamics; stochasticity; China

It is of utmost importance to reflect these needs in price signals, to align the incentives of market agents with the new challenges. The two‑settlement system used by U.S. ISOs falls short to provide efficient intraday economic signals and a cost reflective allocation of intraday rescheduling costs. This paper advocates for a multi‑settlement system, which entails calculating intraday prices as forecasts are updated and re‑schedules are executed. This approach incorporates more granular prices, as in European intraday markets, while keeping the efficient centralized dispatch logic of the ISO model. A stylized case example illustrates the virtues of a multi‑settlement system, which sends cost reflective signals, and consequently facilitates VER integration. Copyright © 2018 by the IAEE.

IO-LCA models are usually built using economic accounts and differ from most process-based models in their use of economic transactions, rather than physical flows, as the drivers of supply-chain GHG emissions. GHG emissions estimates associated with input supply chains are influenced by the price paid by consumers when the relative prices between individual consumers are different. We investigate the significance of the allocation of GHG emissions based on monetary versus physical units by carrying out a case study of the U.S. electricity sector. We create parallel monetary and mixed-unit IO-LCA models using the 2007 Benchmark Accounts of the U.S. economy and sector specific prices for different end users of electricity. This approach is well suited for electricity generation because electricity consumption contributes a significant share of emissions for most processes, and the range of prices paid by electricity consumers allows us to explore the effects of price on allocation of emissions. We find that, in general, monetary input-output models assign fewer emissions per kilowatt to electricity used by industrial sectors than to electricity used by households and service sectors, attributable to the relatively higher prices paid by households and service sectors. This fact introduces a challenging question of what is the best basis for allocating the emissions from electricity generation given the different uses of electricity by consumers and the wide variability of electricity pricing. © 2016 by Yale University",energy accounting; environmental input-output analysis; industrial ecology; input-output life cycle assessment (IO-LCA); mixed-unit input-output model; physical input-output tables (PIOT),Costs; Economics; Electric power utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Supply chains; Energy accounting; Environmental input-output analysis; Industrial ecology; Input output model; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Physical input output table; Electric power generation; commodity price; electricity; electricity generation; emission inventory; energy market; energy use; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; input-output analysis; model; United States

Hence daily observations of hourly prices take the form of a periodic panel rather than a time series of hourly observations. We consider novel panel data approaches to analyse the time series and the cross-sectional dependence of hourly Nord Pool electricity spot prices and loads for the period 2000–2013. Hourly electricity prices and load data are characterized by strong serial long-range dependence in the time series dimension in addition to strong seasonal periodicity, and along the cross-sectional dimension, i.e. the hours of the day, there is a strong dependence which necessarily has to be accounted for in order to avoid spurious inference when focusing on the time series dependence alone. The long-range dependence is modelled in terms of a fractionally integrated panel data model and it is shown that both prices and loads consist of common factors with long memory and with loadings that vary considerably during the day. Due to the competitiveness of the Nordic power market the aggregate supply curve approximates well the marginal costs of the underlying production technology and because the demand is more volatile than the supply, equilibrium prices and loads are argued to identify the periodic power supply curve. The estimated supply elasticities are estimated from fractionally co-integrated relations and range between 0.5 and 1.17 with the largest elasticities being estimated during morning and evening peak hours. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity prices and loads; Fractional integration; Long memory; Panel data models,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Elasticity; Electric power systems; Stochastic systems; Time series; Cross sectional dependence; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Fractional integration; Long memory; Long range dependence; Panel data models; Production technology; Power markets; competitiveness; electricity industry; electricity supply; energy market; panel data; price dynamics

Wind producers are increasingly required to settle their day-ahead electricity bids based on their actual production in real-time, which impacts their bidding behavior and curtailment decisions. The real-time price that players pay or receive in order to settle their deviations is based on the realized forecast errors in wind and demand, so it is affected by the strategies of all wind producers in the market. We formulate a two-stage game where players place ex-ante bids for energy production and then may curtail their realized output in real-time. Then, we find the subgame perfect equilibrium strategy for producer bidding and curtailment. Profit-maximizing bids are equal to the expected value of players' post-curtailment production values. The results show that the endogenous pricing mechanism leads to better tradeoffs of system efficiency and risk compared to the case where penalties are exogenous. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,

To set the charging prices, the service providers faces three uncertainties: the volatility of wholesale electricity price, intermittent renewable energy generation, and spatial-temporal EV charging demand. The main objective of our work here is to help charging service providers to improve their total profits while enhancing customer satisfaction and maintaining power grid stability, taking into account those uncertainties. We employ a linear regression model to estimate the EV charging demand at each charging station, and introduce a quantitative measure for customer satisfaction. Both the greedy algorithm and the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm are employed to derive the optimal charging prices and determine how much electricity to be purchased from the wholesale market in each planning horizon. Simulation results show that DP algorithm achieves an increased profit (up to 9%) compared to the greedy algorithm (the benchmark algorithm) under certain scenarios. Additionally, we observe that the integration of a low-cost energy storage into the system can not only improve the profit, but also smooth out the charging price fluctuation, protecting the end customers from the volatile wholesale market. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Here the cost function of reactive power is developed and calculated most accurately based on generator as reactive power source. This cost function for the generator is modified in some prescribed manner and it is implemented using optimal power flow in MATLAB.

Korea's renewable portfolio standard (RPS) went into effect in 2012, with a goal of increasing the share of renewable generation to 10% of the total load by 2022. We examine the output of wind installations across the Korean peninsula and simulate an increase in wind penetration consistent with Korea's RPS targets. Under a variety of assumptions on demand elasticity, we find that higher shares of wind generation in total supply reduce both the average SMP and its variation. In particular, we find that wind energy output on the Korean peninsula is more correlated with peak electricity demand than has been reported for other regions. The per-unit value of wind energy to owners of wind assets is thus higher for South Korea than would be the case for European or North American locations with a similar mix of fuels other than wind.

The model, which includes both day-ahead and real-time decisions, has been exposed to imbalances of three categories. These imbalances are power plant trips, wind power forecasting errors and wind power fluctuations. As such it is evaluated how the proposed power balancing mechanisms perform.

There are several ways of achieving this, for example using droop control, using night time electricity tariffs, or using smart metering. The goal is twofold: to avoid putting additional load on the electricity grid and power generation, and to reduce the cost to the consumer. This paper looks at the saving potential when charging an electric car using real time tariffs provided by a smart meter, using the Ameren tariffs in Illinois as an example. If prices are known in advance (day-ahead pricing), the optimization only requires picking the cheapest time slots for charging the battery. Further savings can be made by using real time prices that are not known in advance, but the optimization problem then depends on price prediction models, and it becomes much more difficult to solve. This paper presents a simple suboptimal approach, and it quantifies the potential improvements that could be made using more sophisticated price predictions. The result is that cost savings in the order of about 50 USD (1/3 of the electricity costs) are feasible if a fast charger is used using real time pricing. The scale of the savings is such that complex optimization strategies are not worthwhile, and for the foreseeable future simple solutions are expected to be more cost effective.

However, the behavior of wholesale power marketers has generally been overlooked. To fill this gap, our paper focuses on the pricing behavior of five major power marketers in the California PX during 2000: Duke Energy Trading & Marketing, Reliant Energy Services, Dynegy Power Marketing, Enron Power Marketing, and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading. Our unique data set, collected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during an investigation of energy market pricing manipulation, allows us to assess the level of market power using the conduct parameter pricing model. The estimated conduct parameter allows us to determine power marketer pricing behavior is competitive, Cournot, or collusive. Our results indicate that Duke Energy and Reliant were exercising market power when pricing the wholesale electricity they sold in the California PX during 2000. No statistical evidence was uncovered to show that the smaller marketers - Dynegy, Williams and, Enron - were setting prices at a level higher than those consistent with a competitive market. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity; Marketer; Power; Pricing; Wholesale,California; Competitive markets; Cournot; Data sets; Duke energies; Electricity generators; Energy markets; Energy services; Federal energy regulatory commissions; Market Power; Marketer; Power; Power exchange; Power marketing; Pricing models; Statistical evidence; Wholesale; Wholesale electricity; Williams; Williams energies; Commerce; Electric generators; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Electricity; Marketing; Costs; commodity price; electrical power; electricity generation; energy market; statistical analysis; California; United States

Commodity markets exhibit increased volatility when there is little or no underutilized supply capability to meet natural fluctuations in demand. In the case of energy markets, the large capital requirements and significant lead times associated with energy production and delivery make them more susceptible to the imbalances in supply capability and demand. Energy price volatility has destructive impact on market agents, and this impact is intensified when the prices exhibit asymmetric volatility. This article pursues two aspects of the issue. First we consider general aspects, especially the asymmetric pattern of volatility of daily returns of different types of energy products. Then, we analyze the behaviour of daily returns by using traditional models of volatility that include AGARCH, TGARCH, EGARCH, and ARSV strategies, as well as a threshold asymmetric autoregressive stochastic volatility (TA-ARSV) model that we propose.

The numerical example based on the historical data of the PJM market shows that the method can reflect the characteristics of electricity price better and the forecasting accuracy can be improved virtually compared with the conventional GM(1,2) model.

However, it is hard to determine the weights of the combination. The weights of the combination are determined by the history predicted errors in the traditional method of combination. Since it does not take into account of the external environmental influencing factors in forecasting a point price, the historical predicted errors have impact on the forecasting result. Actually, the forecasting precision of different methods is influenced by the environmental factors directly. This paper discusses how to apply DS evidence theory into combined price forecasting with multiple models. The main framework of research is as follow: firstly, modeling data is used to train multiple models, which produces the model and training errors applied in price forecasting; secondly, training errors are converted into credibility of each model in predicting the point. Then, as an output value the credibility is outputted, while the environmental factors of this moment are input variables. As a result, credibility training and forecasting model is built up; thirdly, the environmental factors are regarded as objected input, and the built credibility forecasting model is used to forecast the credibility; fourthly, several models are used to forecast the price respectively; fifthly, DS evidential reasoning method is used to synthetically calculate conformity the credibility of each model, and the combined weight of each model is obtained; sixthly, the forecasted price of multiple models is combined with the predicted weight and the final price is obtained. Finally, a study case serves to analyze and compare combined price forecasting based on DS evidence theory with equally weighted average combined forecasting and variance-covariance optimized combined forecasting and the results illustrate that this model is valid. © 2008 DRPT.",Combined forecasting; Evidence theory; Power market; Price forecasting,Deregulation; Dielectric relaxation; Electric load forecasting; Errors; Industrial economics; Technology; Combined forecasting; D-S evidence theory; Environmental factors; Evidence theory; Evidential reasoning; External-; Forecasting models; Forecasting precision; Influencing factors; Input variables; International conferences; Modeling data; Multiple modeling; Power market; Power technologies; Price forecasting; Training errors; Weighted averaging; Forecasting

In electricity market, the uncertainties of market price and load forecasting will also greatly affect system reliability. This paper presents a novel model and algorithm for joint analysis of power system reliability and market price considering the uncertainties of load forecasts. After a process of reliability evaluation and market simulation, the results include system reliability indices and the probability distribution function of price can be achieved. If the forecasting load is a certain value, the probability distribution of the market price, as well as Expected Value and Standard Deviation, can be obtained directly. Furthermore, a stochastic load model is established to describe the uncertainty of future system load. Taking the uncertainty of load forecasting into consideration, we can suppose the forecasting load to be a random variable. Under different load levels, the market price has different probability distributions. So, the full distribution is the weighted sum of each distribution. In this algorithm, units' uncertain bids and output are incorporated together as well as the probability of forecasting load. In order to show the efficiency of the proposed models and algorithms, two numerical samples are studied in details in this paper. A simple system which contains 4 units is analyzed firstly. The calculations of system reliability indices considering uncertain load forecasting are demonstrated within this example. Consequently, IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) composed of 32 units is utilized to simulate the real electricity market. The probability distribution of market price under different load levels are calculated and then depicted by figures. Through the study, the expectant unit output and its income are also analyzed and some instructive conclusions are yielded which are useful for the participants of the market. Based on these results, it is also possible to evaluate the risk involved by generating units when system load forecasting is uncertain. The sample studies indicate that the model established is efficient. © 2006 IEEE.",Electricity market; Electricity price; Power system; Probability distribution; Reliability evaluation; Uncertainty,Electricity market; Electricity price; Reliability evaluation; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Probability distributions; Reliability analysis; Stochastic models; Uncertainty analysis; Electric power systems

For simplicity, we focus on the double auction in an electricity market. Agents in the market are allowed to buy or sell items (electricity) depending on the prediction of situations. Each agent has a pool of individuals (decision functions) represented in tree structures to decide bid price by using the past result of auctions. A fitness of each individual is defined by using successful bids and a capacity utilization rate of production units for a production of items, and agents improve their individuals based on the GP to get higher return in coming auctions. In simulation studies, changes of bid prices and returns of bidders are discussed depending on demand curves of customers and the weight between an average profit obtained by successful bids and the capacity utilization rate of production units. The validation of simulation studies is examined by comparing results with classical models and price changes in real double auction markets. Since bid prices bear relatively large changes, we apply an approximate method for a control by forcing agents stabilize the changes in bid prices. As a result, we see the stabilization scheme of bid prices in double auction markets is not realistic, then it is concluded that the market contains substantial instability.

Distribution locational marginal pricing and P2P energy trading have each been proposed as potential alternatives to traditional retail pricing, to improve coordination between prosumers with distributed energy resources. Unidirectional locational pricing provides a scalable approach for coordinating demand, considering constraints and losses; while P2P energy trading allows prosumers to negotiate mutually beneficial bilateral energy transactions that increase the utilisation of their flexible energy resources. This paper proposes a market design combining the benefits of these two strategies. First, a new strategy for day-ahead locational marginal pricing is developed, which manages the uncertainty associated with local generation, demand and upstream prices by introducing a spread between the prices charged for energy imports and paid for energy exports. Then, local P2P energy trading platforms are integrated to additionally enable direct prosumer-to-prosumer trading, with transaction fees penalising energy transfers according to probabilistic differential locational marginal prices. Case studies are presented for a multi-phase low voltage distribution network, showing how the design can create value for prosumers, and the system as a whole, by reducing the curtailment of renewable generation. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",Distribution locational marginal pricing; distribution system operator; local energy market; peer-to-peer energy trading; point estimate method; transactive energy,Costs; Energy resources; Energy transfer; Location; Peer to peer networks; Probability distributions; Voltage distribution measurement; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution systems; Locational marginal prices; Locational marginal pricing; Locational pricing; Low voltage distribution network; Probabilistic distribution; Renewable generation; Power markets

The difficulties of forecasting oil prices stem from the nonlinearity and non-stationarity of their dynamics. However, the oil prices are closely correlated with global financial markets and economic conditions, which provides us with sufficient information to predict them. Traditional models are linear and parametric, and are not very effective in predicting oil prices. To address these problems, this study developed a new strategy. Deep (or hierarchical) multiple kernel learning (DMKL) was used to predict the oil price time series. Traditional methods from statistics and machine learning usually involve shallow models; however, they are unable to fully represent complex, compositional, and hierarchical data features. This explains why traditional methods fail to track oil price dynamics. This study aimed to solve this problem by combining deep learning and multiple kernel machines using information from oil, gold, and currency markets. DMKL is good at exploiting multiple information sources. It can effectively identify the relevant information and simultaneously select an apposite data representation. The kernels of DMKL were embedded in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is a deep model and efficient at representing complex and compositional data features. This provided a solid foundation for extracting the key features of oil price dynamics. By using real data for empirical testing, our new system robustly outperformed traditional models and significantly reduced the forecasting errors. © 2018 by the authors.

The problem arises when all the consumers try to avail specific low price time slot to activate their power demands. It ends up with energy congestion or system destabilization. A better strategy is, to forecast a day ahead price and update it instantly, whenever a new consumer purchases an amount of energy for its next day demands. Therefore, every time a new price is applicable for the upcoming purchasers on day-ahead basis. This strategy may be adopted by an aggregator. An aggregator, which is equipped with renewable energy resources (RES), also imports electricity from the grid. It forecasts and updates a day-ahead fluctuating electricity price for its consumers. So that, all the consumers can avail relatively low price electricity slots based on their energy purchasing decisions. In this paper, a regression base statistical model is adopted to investigate two major problems: 1) accurate forecasting of day-ahead electricity price by an aggregator; 2) activate load demands by the consumers at lower electricity prices. In our proposed solution, linear regression is used to forecast the electricity price, exploiting intermittent nature of the renewables. Whereas, load activation strategy is proposed by introducing electrical loads with different levels of delay tolerance. Applying boundary condition values using logistic regression, a consumer can activate its loads on different electricity prices. The simulation results have established an effectively forecasted value of electricity price and an accurate activation of consumer's load demands. © 2017 IEEE.",demand response; load management; price forecasting; regression models,Chemical activation; Consumer behavior; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Electric load management; Electric power utilization; Energy resources; Forecasting; Purchasing; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Demand response; Electricity prices; Logistic regressions; Price forecasting; Purchasing decisions; Regression model; Renewable energy resource (RES); Statistical modeling; Power markets

In this study we empirically investigate whether Spot Electricity Price Series is Stationary by using 17,520 hourly spot prices for each of the five regions of Indian electricity market and applying Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test, Phillips Peron Test, Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin Test and Narayan and Popp Test allowing for structural breaks. The results of the study will help power market participants understand the nitty-gritty's and nuances associated with Indian spot electricity prices for effective application of time series econometric models. © 2017 The Authors.

The convergence of prices between the day-ahead forward and the real-time markets analysed in order to determine whether persistent price differences between the two markets exist. Arbitrage opportunities exist if there is a persistent difference between prices in the day-ahead forward and real-time market. Markets are considered to be efficient if it is not possible for market participants to earn an excess profit through exploitation of price differences. Furthermore, we examined how the ex-post risk premium changes over time using rolling estimations and find that after the implementation of dual pricing, the risk premium increased significantly for day and peak hours where the demand is relatively higher compared to night hours. As market participants have more experience regarding the dynamics of the market, the difference between real-time and day-ahead forward prices converges to zero since the dual-pricing regime enforce market participants to forecast accurately by punishing the forecast error. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity; Market efficiency; Market structure,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Efficiency; Electricity; Risk perception; Arbitrage opportunity; Convergence of prices; Electricity prices; Market efficiency; Market participants; Market structures; Rolling estimations; Wholesale electricity markets; Power markets; efficiency measurement; electricity supply; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; policy implementation; pricing policy; real time; Turkey

The dataset is obtained from the official website of Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) and Power Exchange of India Limited (PXIL). These two exchanges are responsible for every short-term transaction in the Indian power market. The data consists of prices in Rs/MWh for each time block from November 1, 2014 to October 31, 2015.

Therefore, the demand side management (DSM) is becoming unavoidable especially with the increasing use of renewable energy sources. One of the most known tactics of DSM is the use pricing strategies to threaten users to schedule their loads by controlling their own appliances. In this paper, a new model of electricity market operators is proposed based on three actors: The utility grid (G) with renewable energy (RE) generation, the electricity consumer (U) and a storage company (S). This approach aims to develop the adequate hourly prices which optimize the utility function of each operator. Then, in order to deal with this objective, two related games are defined. The first one is based on the satisfaction function of U and the G and aims to give the hourly prices of consumers' electricity bills. While the second one is based on the satisfaction function of G and S in order to optimize the hourly prices of G's electricity bills. Finally, a case study based on a given RE production and consumers load forecasts has been considered. Simulation results show that the obtained hourly prices allows the consumer load curve to follow the RE curve generation while achieving the main objective of the proposed approach. © 2015 IEEE.",game theory three players; optimization; outsourced storage; Renewable Energy based generation,Costs; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Game theory; Optimization; Population statistics; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Electricity consumers; Electricity demands; Model of electricity market; Population growth; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Satisfaction functions; Use of renewable energies; Electric power transmission networks

The aggregator interacts with the wholesale electricity market and through some market-clearing mechanism is incentivized to provide (or consume) a certain amount of active (or reactive) power over some period of time, for which it will be compensated. The objective is for the aggregator to design a pricing strategy for incentivizing DERs to modify their active (or reactive) power consumptions (or productions) so that they collectively provide the amount that the aggregator has agreed to provide. The aggregator and DERs' strategic decision-making process can be cast as a Stackelberg game, in which aggregator acts as the leader and the DERs are the followers. In previous work [Gharesifard et al., 2013b, a], we have introduced a framework in which each DER uses the pricing information provided by the aggregator and some estimate of the average energy that neighboring DERs can provide to compute a Nash equilibrium solution in a distributed manner. Here, we focus on the interplay between the aggregator's decision-making process and the DERs' decision-making process. In particular, we propose a simple feedback-based privacy-preserving pricing control strategy that allows the aggregator to coordinate the DERs so that they collectively provide the amount of active (or reactive) power agreed upon, provided that there is enough capacity available among the DERs. We provide a formal analysis of the stability of the resulting closed-loop system. We also discuss the shortcomings of the proposed pricing strategy, and propose some avenues of future work.

For this, we construct a unique panel data-set and formulate a spatial panel econometric model with fixed country effects for the period of 1980-2009. A special feature of the proposed empirical model is that cross-country interdependence in energy prices surfaces through two channels, a metric of similarity towards energy policy and a metric of trade in energy goods. We estimate the parameters of that model and conduct several comparative static experiments. We find that higher income per capita and lower efficiency in energy distribution tend to raise energy prices whereas higher net imports of energy and more abundant energy resource endowments reduce them. We also find that bilateral trade in energy goods is an important channel of transmission of shocks in energy prices across countries. The estimation results suggest that countries that use the same types of resources to generate energy are likely to transmit energy price shocks to each other through competition effects. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,competition (economics); data set; econometrics; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy policy; energy resource; import; numerical model; OECD; panel data; price dynamics

In this market, firm's cost function is recovered by optimizing behavior for each firm.

To account for that, this paper proposes a methodology to estimate the downward effect of renewable generation participation upon the day-ahead electricity market prices, since such an effect is quite intuitive observing the merit order of the generating units. The European Electricity Market Matching Algorithm (EMMA) is currently based on Euphemia (Price Coupling of Regions), though there are several differences among countries across Europe. The new algorithm proposed uses market orders, which include aggregate hourly orders such as aggregate supply and demand curves. These orders are simple orders and the marginal price is affected by complex orders, especially by the minimum income condition (MIC) used in the Iberian Electricity Market and considered in our proposed algorithm. A case study of the Spanish day-ahead electricity market is evaluated for 2015, for which a daily generation sample is composed of 16 days in 2015. The sample is created following the characteristics of thermal production, renewable production and inframarginal production.

Locational marginal price (LMP), as a sensitive price signal, has a potential but considerable correlation with renewable energy generation. In this context, this paper focuses on the joint fluctuation laws between LMP and renewables consumed to generate electricity. At first, LMP and renewables consumption data from Independent System Operator New England (ISO-NE) are collected and preprocessed. Then, through highly comparative time-series analysis (hctsa), it is found that discrete symbolization features have effective description ability. Therefore, a coarse-grained method is conducted to convert the real matrix data into a symbol vector based on numerical distribution analysis. Next, joint fluctuation complex networks are constructed according to the symbol vector. From a global perspective, the joint fluctuation network follows an exponential distribution and exhibits hierarchical modularity.

Previous studies draw a link between the affluence of a society and the EROI of its energy system, and show that EROIs of renewables are lower than those of fossil fuels. Logically, concerns have been expressed that system-wide EROI may decrease during a renewable energy transition. First, I explain theoretically that the EROIs of renewables themselves could then decrease as energy-efficient fossil fuels would be replaced by less energy-efficient renewables in the supply-chain. Then, using the multi-regional input-output model THEMIS, I estimate the evolution of EROIs and prices of electric technologies from 2010 to 2050 for different scenarios. Global EROI of electricity is predicted to go from 12 in 2010 to 11 in 2050 in a business-as-usual scenario, but down to 6 in a 100% renewable one. Finally, I study the economic implication of a declining EROI. An inverse relation between EROI and price is suggested empirically, even though theory shows that both quantities may move in the same direction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Energy transition; EROI; Input-output; MRIO; Sustainability; THEMIS,alternative energy; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy market; estimation method; fossil fuel; input-output analysis; price dynamics; scenario analysis; supply chain management; sustainability

A novel two-step probabilistic approach is proposed, with a particular focus on the Belgian case. The first step consists in computing the net regulation volume state transition probabilities. It is modeled as a matrix computed using historical data. This matrix is then used to infer the imbalance prices, since the net regulation volume can be related to the level of reserves activated and the corresponding marginal prices for each activation level are published by the Belgian Transmission System Operator one day before electricity delivery. This approach is compared to a deterministic model, a multi-layer perceptron, and to a widely used probabilistic technique, Gaussian Processes. © 2019 IEEE.",Electricity markets; imbalance prices forecasting; machine learning; probabilistic forecast,Commerce; Forecasting; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Power markets; Prices forecasting; Probabilistic approaches; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic forecasts; Probabilistic technique; Short term energy markets; State transition probabilities; Transmission system operators; Costs

In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition-ensemble forecasting paradigm based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and local linear prediction (LLP). The EEMD is used to decompose energy price time series into components, including several intrinsic mode functions and one residual with a simplified structure. Motivated by the findings of the fully local characteristics of a time series decomposed by the EEMD, we adopt the LLP technique to forecast each component. The forecasting results of all the components are aggregated as a final forecast. For validation, three types of energy price time series, crude oil, electricity and natural gas prices, are studied. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves an improvement in terms of both level forecasting and direction forecasting. The performance of the proposed model is also validated through comparison with several energy price forecasting approaches from the literature. In addition, the robustness and the effects of the parameter settings of LLP are investigated. We conclude the proposed model is easy to implement and efficient for energy price forecasting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Energy price; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Forecasting; Local linear prediction,Costs; Natural gas; Signal processing; Time series; Energy prices; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decompositions (EEMD); Ensemble forecasting; Intrinsic Mode functions; Local characteristics; Local linear predictions; Natural gas price; Forecasting; decomposition analysis; empirical analysis; energy market; ensemble forecasting; prediction; price determination; time series analysis

Variations in construction cost disrupt transportation agencies in making right investment decisions and estimating accurate construction costs for projects. A wide range of variables has been proposed in different studies to explain variations in construction cost. There is value in conducting a research study that attempts to consider a comprehensive list of variables with potentials to explain the variations. The study needs to simultaneously take into account all possible explanatory variables to examine their relations with construction costs. The objective of this research is to assess the relations of several potential variables to explain variations in submitted unit price bids for major asphalt line items in highway projects. The primary contribution of this paper to the body of knowledge is the creation of a random parameters model to explain variations in submitted unit price bids for asphalt line items in highway projects. The identified variables used to build the random parameters model were classified into two major tiers. Tier 1 represents project-specific categories, including project characteristics, major supply sources for critical materials, and price adjustment clauses. Tier 2 represents global and external categories, consisting of the level of activities in local highway construction market, construction market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, and energy market conditions. It is expected that the findings of this paper will contribute to the current practice of cost estimation and investment decision making by helping transportation agencies develop more accurate budgets and contractors prepare more accurate bids for highway projects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Asphalt; Budget control; Commerce; Decision making; Highway planning; Investments; Road construction; Construction markets; Explanatory variables; Highway construction; Highway construction costs; Investment decision making; Investment decisions; Project characteristics; Transportation agencies; Cost estimating

For each GW increase in responsive reserve (RRS) or nonspinning reserve (NSRS) procurement quantities, we estimate price increases of about US$3.47 per MW per hour and US$5.63 per MW per hour, respectively; while the cost of an additional 1 GW of regulation up (REGUP) and regulation down (REGDN) is a much higher US$17 perMWper hour and US$31 per MW per hour, respectively. A US$1/MWh increase in the DAM energy pricetends to increase RRS and REGUP prices by nearly US$1 per MW per hour, about twice the estimated impact for NSRS that is not necessarily online when selected. The participation of interruptible loads to provide RRSs reduces the RRS price, and this effect increased nearly six-fold from the first to the second half of our sample time period. An increase in wind generation tends to decrease AS prices because it reduces the DAM energy price via the merit-order effect. Hence, Texas’s wind generation expansion has not raised ERCOT’s AS prices in our sample period, which is characterized by a stable AS requirement and declining natural gas prices. Going forward, however, Texas could face AS cost escalation due to the high REGUP and REGDN prices, should ERCOT’s requirement and procurement of those services increase due to rising renewable production. © 2019 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.",Ancillary services (ASS); Day-ahead market (DAM); Electric reliability council of texas (ERCOT); Electricity prices; Texas,

This research aimed at investigating the impact on the market prices of the Iberian Electricity Market, MIBEL, due to increases of the feed-in generation, as such an increase is expected to occur in the next few years, namely for PV systems. This research was conducted using real market data publicly available in the web site of the Iberian Market Operator for 2016. To estimate this impact, for each trading hour of 2016 we considered new segments at price 0,0 /MWh to translate the priority given to this type of generation. These segments representing the new feed-in generation were then used together with the selling bids submitted by market agents to build the new aggregated selling curve. The new market price was finally obtained as the intersection of the new selling curve with the original buying curve, that was assumed unchanged. The global result indicates that if the feed-in generation increases by 25% regarding the values of 2016, then the average annual market price decreases by 6,57 % regarding the original value of 39,42 /MWh. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity market; Feed-in generation; Iberian Electricity Market; Impacts; Prices,Costs; Electric industry; Power markets; Sales; Iberian electricity market; Iberian market; Impacts; Market agents; Market price; Prices; PV system; Real markets; Commerce

In a competitive power market, congestion problem becomes an obstacle since it directly influences nodal pricing at various buses in the system. To keep a flat price profile at every node, dispatching of generating units and also load curtailment in a system may be required. Different pricing at every node or LMPs (Locational Marginal Price) are due to congestion of the network. The LMP at any node is the total cost of the incremental outputs of the marginal generators to deliver one unit of energy at that node without increasing the flow of the congested line. This paper presents a novel method to minimize total cost in respect of flow tariff, load costs, generator bids, zero congestion surplus and choosing properly the reference bus in a highly congested power system network. An improved LMP has been defined in this context which takes into account all of the above factors. The LMPs are calculated by incorporating Shift Factor (SF) based DC-Optimal power flow (DC-OPF) model. The proposed method has been applied in a four bus network and the results obtained have been found to be capable of eradicating the local market power monopoly in a system. © 2017 IEEE.",Congestion; Congestion-surplus; DC-OPF; LMP; Shift Factor,Buses; Commerce; Deregulation; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Power markets; Traffic congestion; Competitive power markets; Congestion; Congestion-surplus; DC-OPF; Locational marginal prices; Power system networks; Shift factors; Transmission congestion management; Costs

In this paper, we implement a machine learning model to assess the usefulness of introducing exogenous variables in imbalance price forecasting. This method shows improved results compared to classical methods. Since the imbalance price is obtained by the marginal cost of producing the missing energy, the strategic behaviour of a WPP will influence the imbalance price.

In this paper, a TOU pricing method is proposed considering dynamic time period partition. Distinguished from the conventional TOU prices fixed for a long term, the proposed time period partition is updated every day due to the volatility of high-penetration renewable energy, and determined based on the day-ahead system net load forecast. For practical implementation with minimal policy adjustment, the levels of TOU prices remain unchanged, and the daily time periods are categorized into three clusters using the Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm, i.e., peak, intermediate and valley periods. Then a day-ahead economic dispatch model considering DR is formulated to evaluate the impacts of the proposed TOU prices on the accommodation of renewable energy. Case studies based on a provincial power grid illustrates that the proposed method can determine the time period partition of TOU prices according to the system net load forecast, and effectively encourage DR resources to interact with power grids and improve renewable energy accommodation. © 2017 IEEE.",clustering; demand response; renewable energy; time period partition; time-of-use pricing,Clustering algorithms; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Fuzzy clustering; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; clustering; Demand response; Renewable energies; Time period partitions; Time-of-use pricing; Electric load dispatching

We implement an econometric approach using data from the Interconnection-France-Angleterre (IFA); such an approach controls for factors that may influence prices besides the ETM. The modelling indicates that the target model raised day-ahead capacity prices for the direction FR→GB by €7.45 to €8.07/MWh. Results for the GB→FR direction are sensitive to the model used, but range from €0.475/MWh to €10.65/MWh, with the higher value coming from a censored regression model. Using the model's prediction, adding capacity of 1000MW would roughly reduce prices by €6. Gas price differentials account for about €1 of the interconnection price. The overall indication is that the ETM has achieved some of its initial goals in allowing interconnection prices to rise and more fully reflect congestion rents and the need for investment. Our work should be taken as preliminary, as many factors, such as long-term contracts, may further influence conclusions. © 2016 IEEE.",econometrics; power system economics; power system interconnection,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Electric power system interconnection; Investments; Regression analysis; Statistics; Approach controls; Censored regression; econometrics; Electricity interconnections; Interconnection capacity; Long-term contracts; Power system economics; Power system interconnection; Power markets

The Portuguese market is a natural setting to measure the effect of intermittent renewable generation on electricity prices, as the share of wind in total load demand is one of the largest in the world. Using daily data from 2007 to 2014, we estimate an ARX-EGARCHX model where wind generation and total load demand enter as exogenous explanatory variables for the electricity price. The results show that wind generation reduces the average price level, while it increases the price volatility. Both the mean and volatility effects are substantially stronger for day-time peak prices than for night-time base-load prices. © 2015 IEEE.",EGARCH; Electricity price; Intermittent wind power,Commerce; Electric power generation; Power markets; Wind power; EGARCH; Electricity prices; Explanatory variables; Price levels; Price volatility; Renewable generation; Volatility effects; Wind generation; Costs

A double threshold GARCH(1,1) methodology is utilized where the VIX index is used as the threshold regime change indicator. Daily data from January 4, 1999, to December 31, 2013, are used. A sub-period analysis covering only the financial crisis period of January 2, 2007, to December 31, 2009, is also performed. This study provides evidence that the level of equity market volatility (i.e., VIX) that triggers a regime shift is commodity specific. The results also indicate that the threshold VIX values are time varying. Furthermore, natural gas prices appear to withstand considerably more volatility in the equity market than do the prices of other energy commodities. This relationship is even more pronounced during the financial crisis period. Approximately 70% and 50% of the estimated coefficients display asymmetric sensitivities due to regime changes during the entire period and the crisis period, respectively.

This cooperation has been very successful, not only for its contribution to the existence of an electricity market on an Iberian level, but also on a European scale, as a significant step in building the Internal Energy Market. The price of electricity in the MIBEL is very changeable. This creates a lot of uncertainty and risk in market actors. Due to continuous changes in demand and marginal price adjustment, buyers and sellers can not know in advance the evolution of prices. Our interest is to study of this uncertainty since the perspective of the buyer and not the seller's perspective. The aim of this work is to develop a graphical analysis of the variables involved in the Spanish Energy Market in order to explain the electric price and provide to small traders, that could be interested in participating in that market, better knowledge of the schedule. On the other hand, large industrial consumers use this information to design strategies to optimize its production capacity and improve their production costs. In this article the variable of interest is the marginal price instead of demand. This paper provides a graphical analysis by means of an easily reproducible automatization with the R project for statistical computing that allows to explore, visualize and understand the key variables that define its final value.

How to price the reliability in electricity market is one of the most important tasks for power system reliability analysis. In this paper, relation between backup capacity and supply reliability is established based on load forecasting probability density function. The reliability charging rates for customer load with different reliability requirements are determined by using back up reserve cost. Under reliability market, load customers bid the reliability requirement and price to the power transaction center (PX) according to their own reliability demands and the published reliability costs. The reserve schedule is determined according to customer reliability requirements and back up reserve market price. The PX calculates the required added back up reserve capacity caused by generation unit outage, and further the reliability charging rates for generation unit is determined. Load point reliability can be maintained by controlling the load curtailment when system load is greater than the total capacity of scheduled generators and back up units in real time operation. The proposed method can be used to price the customer reliability and generator unit reliability. It can also be used to determine system back up capacity requirement.

They connect customers to local energy sources without conversion, thus reducing power losses. However, the unique features of DC impose strict requirements for system operation compared to AC. Within the context of a liberalized energy market, this article demonstrates three promising market designs—an outcome of a comprehensive engineering design framework—that meet those DC requirements. They are an integrated market design, which incorporates all system costs into energy prices; a market design that passes wholesale energy prices directly to prosumers; and a locational energy market design that relieves congestion with nodal prices. An optimization model estimates the three market designs’ performance by simulating a realistic DC distribution system, featuring a high share of electric vehicles. Results indicate that the integrated market design is optimal in theory but computationally infeasible in practice. The wholesale energy price design aiming at constraint-free energy trading requires substantial investments in flexibility. The locational energy market design yields nearly optimal operation in urban networks and is considered the best feasible market design for DC distribution systems. © 2020 The Author(s)",Direct current; Distribution system; Electricity market design; Flexibility; Optimization,DC power transmission; Free energy; Investments; Location; Power markets; DC distribution system; Energy market designs; Engineering design; Liberalized energy markets; Locational pricing; Optimal operation; Optimization modeling; Substantial investments; Costs; electric vehicle; electricity industry; energy market; energy planning; feasibility study; optimization; price determination; price dynamics

Municipal wastewater treatment plants consume approximately 1 % of the electricity consumption of a country's total electricity consumption, to reduce nutrient concentrations from the incoming wastewater before discharging the water back into the environment. In this paper, a novel economic optimal control strategy is proposed for unlocking the available energy flexibility in wastewater treatment. The strategy suggests that the power consumption in wastewater treatment can be flexible since the water is treated in large tanks with long retention times where specialized aeration equipment is repeatedly switched on and off. By controlling these switching times with respect to nutrient concentrations, electricity consumption can be predicted and shifted in time and hence provide short-term demand side flexibility. The proposed principle is used to reduce the operating costs of a wastewater treatment plant by enabling the flexibility to distribute the aeration load to periods with less expensive power prices. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated for the operation of a single wastewater treatment plant and the strategy is backtested on Nord Pool market data from 2019. This shows modest savings of 1.15% if only the day-ahead market is considered. However, if the regulating and special regulating power prices are included in the optimization the realized savings are in the magnitude of 7.23% and 27.32%, respectively. Thus this study is considered as a step towards exploiting flexibility for the benefit of reducing the combined taxation and aeration cost of wastewarer treatment. © 2020",Balancing market; Energy flexibility; Optimal control; Optimization; Price-based control; Smart energy application; Wastewater treatment,Cost reduction; Electric power utilization; Nutrients; Operating costs; Optimal control systems; Power markets; Reclamation; Renewable energy resources; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Taxation; Water aeration; Water treatment plants; Electricity consumers; Electricity-consumption; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Municipal wastewaters; Nutrient concentrations; Optimal control strategy; Renewable energy source; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; aeration; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy planning; municipal solid waste; optimization; power plant; prediction; wastewater treatment

Market participants manage a tradeoff between, bidding in a lower price market (day-ahead), but with typically higher volume, or aiming for a lower volume market but with potentially higher returns (balance energy market). Companies try to forecast the extremes of revenues or prices, in order to manage risk and opportunity, assigning their assets in an optimal way. It is thought that in general, electricity markets have quasi-deterministic principles, rather than being based on speculation, hence the desire to forecast the price based on variables that can describe the outcome of the market. Many studies address this problem from a statistical approach or by performing multiple-variable regressions, but they very often focus only on the time series analysis. In 2019, the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) was made available in the UK for the first time. Taking this opportunity, this study focusses on five LOLP variables (with different time-ahead estimations) and other quasi-deterministic variables, to explain the price behavior of a multi-variable regression model. These include base production, system load, solar and wind generation, seasonality, day-ahead price and imbalance volume contributions. Three machine-learning algorithms were applied to test for performance, Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost. XGBoost presented higher performance and so it was chosen for the implementation of the real time forecast step. The model returns a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.89 £/MWh, a coefficient of determination (R2 score) of 76.8% and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 124.74. The variables that contribute the most to the model are the Net Imbalance Volume, the LOLP (aggregated), the month and the De-rated margins (aggregated) with 28.6%, 27.5%, 14.0%, and 8.9% of weight on feature importance respectively. © 2020 by the authors.",Balance energy market; Demand response; Imbalance market; Loss of load probability; Machine learning; Price forecast,Adaptive boosting; Balancing; Decision trees; Fintech; Forecasting; Loss of load probability; Machine learning; Mean square error; Multivariable systems; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Gradient boosting; Loss of load probabilities (LOLP); Market participants; Mean absolute error; Mean squared error; Real-time forecasts; Risk and opportunity; Statistical approach; Power markets

In particular, we employ principal component analysis and generate Granger causality networks to examine the degree of interconnectedness of the NEM in a time-varying setting. We find that the derived measures of interdependence can be related to actual market events such as price spikes, unexpected high demand for electricity, sudden increases in price volatility, rebidding of dominant generators, the temporary or permanent outage of major power stations, and upgrades and limitations in transmission capacity. In the analysed network, we find that stronger dependence is exhibited by regional markets that are linked through interconnectors, while the direction of Granger causality can be related to interregional trade. We further examine the usefulness of the derived measures for forecasting distributional characteristics of spot prices such as the maximum price, volatility, price spreads, or upcoming periods of price spikes. Our results suggest that the derived network measures have predictive power, albeit limited, for the behaviour of spot electricity prices in the NEM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Dependence and interconnectedness; Dynamic networks; Electricity markets; Multivariate analysis; Risk management; Spot prices,Electric industry; Power markets; Statistical tests; Dynamic network analysis; Granger Causality; National electricity markets; Network measures; Price volatility; Regional markets; Spot electricity prices; Transmission capacities; Costs; electricity supply; energy market; multivariate analysis; price dynamics; risk assessment; Australia

In this study we assess the performance of four machine learning models that forecast the electricity price. Next, we rank the variables according to their importance and identify to what extent different estimators and feature selection methods affect the performance of the forecasting models. We found that Random Forest regression is the best performing model regardless of the number of features selected and the feature selection method applied. Secondly, the performance of all models was not found to improve significantly after the selection of the top 15 ranked variables.

We tailor a recently introduced econometric model with fundamental impacts, which is successful in describing the pricing of day contracts. Our estimation results show that the mean reversion and the positive price impact of neighboring contracts are generic features of the price formation process on the intraday market, independent of the time of day. Intraday auction prices have higher explanatory power for the pricing of night than day contracts, particularly, for the first and last 15-min. contract in a night hour. Intradaily updated forecasts of wind power infeed are the only significant fundamental factors for intraday electricity prices at night. Neither expected conventional capacities nor the slope of the merit order curve contribute to explaining price dynamics.

The aim of this paper is to show how consumers can estimate the TEC for any temperature.

Therefore, this paper presents a study on the utilization of a novel electricity price classification framework which consists of Bayesian extreme learning machine (BELM) model, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm, and multivariate sequence segmentation (MSS). Considering many advantages of deep learning structure in capturing the hierarchical and sophisticated characteristics of multidimensional sequence, the multi-layer BELM (ML-BELM) model is also extended and utilized to the modeling. To demonstrate the potential of the pattern classification framework, the proposed approaches are evaluated using hourly clearing price cases from Canada Ontario and New York electricity market. In particular, we investigate the performance of different classifiers regarding the 3 multi-classification and higher dimensional classification modes with respect to various scenarios in terms of precision, recall, AUC (Area Under roc Curve) score, and F1-measure indicators.

Hence, a descriptive research was conducted to identify the major factors leading to the periods of spikes and jumps in the Indian energy exchange’s day-ahead market (DAM) prices of all the regions (north, south, east, west and north east) from August 2008 until June 2017. It was found that the major factors affecting DAMs prices are regulatory, weather, fuel supply, transmission congestion; power plant outages/new plants operational, frequency and reservoir levels. This study will encourage the stakeholders to further model and forecast prices devising profit maximisation techniques thereon.

This process aims at establishing liquid energy exchanges that provide clear price signals, providing indications on the profitability of different operations: Production, retail, trading in interconnections. This paper aims at developing a unit commitment model for examining zonal market pricing in Kazakhstan. The latter has an extensive landscape but sparsely populated, while is also characterized by the high availability of domestic fossil fuels, but located in different sub-regions of the country. The provision of zonal price signals in such a power system in invaluable, as it enables the provision of clear price signals on the needed infrastructure and the estimation of the zonal hourly energy and technology mix. Moreover, in enables the formation of dynamic bidding strategies by market participants in cases with favourable conditions, such as the implementation of scarcity pricing. This paper presents a unit commitment model that used to assess different bidding strategies and to provide zonal price signals. The strategies are formed, depending on the technology type and fuel prices comparison. Results provide clear signals on needed infrastructure among zones in Kazakhstan. It also shows that dynamic biding can lead to market coupling. Finally, it indicates the importance of institutional capability to monitor bidding strategies, eliminating speculation. © 2020, Econjournals.

As an alternative to relying on standard likelihood maximization, the adoption of a fully Bayesian paradigm is explored, that relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) stochastic simulation and provides the posterior distributions of the model parameters. The proposed method is applied to one- and two-factor stochastic models, using both simulated and real data. The results demonstrate good agreement between the maximum likelihood and MCMC point estimates. The latter approach, however, provides a more complete characterization of the model uncertainty, an information that can be exploited to obtain a more realistic assessment of the forecasting error.

This approach extracts the most significant features for the price classification models and maintains a good prediction performance with very little computational cost. The selected features are applied in four popular data-driven prediction models to classify the future price. The performance of each model is tested using real-world electricity market data.

Despite the importance of these predictions, however, forecasters and market pundits face a difficult challenge when trying to forecast over the long-term. While statistical models can credibly rely on assumptions about the relationship between variables in the short-term, they are frequently less reliable in the long-term as political and technological transformations profoundly change how the economy works over time. Towards improving long-term predictions for energy commodities, this paper uses the elicitation and aggregation of experts' beliefs to put forward forecasts for crude oil and natural gas prices by incentivizing experts to tell the truth and minimising their own biases through the application of the Bayesian Truth Serum.

However, this paper develops a two-step approach to estimate the substitution and output effects of changes in energy demand resulting from changes in prices and further examines the implications of these effects on CO2 emissions using European industrial dataset over the period 1995–2007. In our empirical estimations, instead of relying only on iSUR model like previous studies, we introduced a multilevel model, which is a more befitting model to our data. Our analysis covers industry as a whole and for different sector types. The primary results emerged from our analysis suggest a strong evidence using the multilevel model. Generally, our results show that production inputs are substitutable. We find the substitution and output effects to be negatively related to CO2 emissions, however, the substitution effects dominate. From policy perspectives, our results suggest that output adjustments may not play a significant role in reducing emissions. We find the overall effects of changes in energy demand to be moderate. Then, we argue that increment in energy taxes should be complemented by cleaner factor substitution and sustainable growth to achieve a desirable carbon reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon emissions; Decomposition effects; European industries; Substitution elasticities,Carbon dioxide; Energy management; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Taxation; Carbon emissions; Empirical estimations; European industry; Factor substitutions; Reducing emissions; Substitution effect; Sustainable growth; Two-step approach; Industrial emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; demand elasticity; energy market; energy policy; price dynamics; substitution; Europe

Using a combination of Recurrence Plot (RP) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) we find that, after the the change in the GC time, short term price volatility significantly decreased between 2001 and 2008 while long term price volatility is not affected by CG change. Similar results are obtained by means of spectral analysis on the price series, showing a significant reduction in its variability. The results of our analysis suggest that a dynamical regime shift of the price occurred, and such shift is linked to the GC change whereby shorter GC intervals facilitate short-term forecasting on electricity demand and better reliability on the supply side.

In this paper a bilevel scheduling model is proposed to determine the long-term optimal contract price between the DSO and aggregator for executing direct load control in smart distribution systems. The DSO and aggregator are considered as two different agents with individual objectives in the proposed bilevel scheduling model. On the one hand, the aggregator maximizes its profit by bidding load reduction of the large consumers to the DSO by executing a direct load control (DLC) mechanism, and on the other hand, the DSO tries to minimize its overall cost to supply all consumers. The DSO has two options to follow the variation of its consumers’ demand: purchasing energy from the electricity market and executing DLC programs. The bilevel programming formulation is transferred into an equivalent single level programming problem using its Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions. Moreover, the uncertainties of the electricity market price, demand of consumers, and generation of a wind power plant are modeled via point estimate method. Two typical case studies are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling model. © TÜBİTAK.",Bilevel optimization; Karush–Kuhn–Tucker; Load aggregator; Optimal contract pricing; Point estimate method,Aggregates; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Power markets; Scheduling; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Bi-level optimization; Bi-level programming; Demand side participations; Electricity supply and demands; Optimal contract; Optimality conditions; Point estimate method; Smart distribution systems; Electric load management

The conventional approach is not suitable when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. Bayesian formulas remain reasonable in such a case. Researchers usually deal with numerous potentially important variables in forecasting. Newly methods like Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA), Dynamic Model Selection (DMS) and Median Probability Model nicely deal with model uncertainty. The study discusses energy commodity prices development. FRED-MD large macroeconomic database is applied. Forecasting commodities prices is a hard task. Therefore, it seems interesting to check the novel methodology. It allows both explanatory variables and regression coefficients to vary in time.

Electricity price forecasting is key for devising optimal bidding strategies for WPPs as well as for efficient energy management of BESS. This paper discusses the opportunities for WPPs if they participate in wind energy trading. To understand the case, a wavelet-based neural network (WNN) has been employed for day-ahead electricity price forecasting in Indian power market. The real data from Indian Electricity Exchange (IEX) is used to evaluate the performance of the forecast model. The predicted price information would help in deviation settlement for WPP by optimal scheduling the BESS and in mitigating the voltage and frequency incursions. Further, it would bring more economic values to WPPs as well as grid operator for improving the grid reliability. © 2018 IEEE.",Battery Energy Storage System; Electricity price forecasting; Energy management; Wavelet-based neural network; Wind power producer,Battery storage; Commerce; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Grid computing; Smart power grids; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Battery energy storage system (BESS); Battery energy storage systems; Electricity exchanges; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Optimal bidding strategy; Power producer; Wavelet-based neural network; Power markets

They usually consume enormous amount of electric power, which lead to high operational costs and this has been recognized as a main challenge in cloud computing. Energy cost can be reduced by directing the requests to the favor of data center with lower electricity price by incorporating spatially and temporally price diversity, especially in the multi-region electricity markets. If the electricity prices of data centers are predicted in advance, the cloud provider can reduce energy cost. An efficient electricity price prediction is needed for minimizing electricity bill of GDCs. This paper proposes electricity price prediction for GDCs in multi-region electricity markets. Experiment is conducted on real-life electricity price data sets with machine learning algorithms. By comparatively assessing the prediction accuracy of the models, the most accurate one is selected.

To address the profit maximization problem for power generation groups in day-ahead market, this paper proposes a medium- and long-term optimal scheduling model for cascade reservoirs, taking complex hydraulic and electric couplings into consideration.

The second step is the cost calculation on internal system taking into account the expected prices in the first step. The third step is based on the results of the previous steps, and consists of preparing the bids for external markets with the focus on the consumer's cost.

The interlaced design of a power system and electricity market operations are closely linked with the system reliability and electricity market efficiency. Accurate convergence of prices between the day-ahead electricity markets (DAM) and the associated real time energy markets (RTM) is a good indicator of a well functioning electricity market. Consistency between DAM and RTM prices is beneficial for market efficiency because it helps ensure that the resources committed each day are the most economic and efficient ones to meet the system demand in real time, thereby preserving system reliability and security. The divergence of RTM electricity prices from DAM electricity prices imposes unnecessary additional inefficiencies and costs on the system, thereby potentially threatening system reliability. Virtual bidding in the day-ahead market provides a useful function in facilitating price convergence between the day ahead and real time markets. The arbitrage possibilities enabled by virtual bidding are also useful mechanisms for improving efficiency in the electricity markets. By adding liquidity to the market, virtual bidding significantly helps in reducing market risk for participants and considerably reduces price volatility as well. Network congestion, which is also seen as a key reason for price spikes and consequently price divergence in electricity markets can be managed efficiently and effectively by implementing a full network model. A detailed and accurate representation of the power system, which aids in the determination and mitigation of transmission constraints, will lead to consistency of congestion patterns between DAM and RTM, thereby contributing to improved convergence of electricity prices in market operations. The insufficient ramping capability in any system may trigger power balance violations resulting in an infeasible real time dispatch that cannot maintain supply and demand power balance. In such scenarios, the system has to rely on regulation services to resolve the issue in real-time after the imbalance has caused area control error (ACE) deviation. If there is insufficient regulation service, the shortage in ramping capability may result in leaning on the interconnection, which is an undesirable outcome. Moreover, when power balance is violated, the RTM energy price is not priced by economic bids, but by administrative penalty prices, which may impact market efficiency in the long run. These price spikes generally may be avoided by further modelling and dispatch improvements that increase the accuracy and flexibility of real-time dispatches. Market design improvements such as implementation of flexible ramp system constraints, that ensure additional unloaded online capacity that is available and ramp feasible, and can be dispatched at any time interval in either upward or downward direction by designating a system ramp margin, must be made available. This paper discusses several aspects needed for improved price convergence and thereby increased efficiency in electricity markets, such as virtual bidding, flexible ramping constraints, implementing a full network model for alleviating network congestion, advanced forecasting systems and demand response. The paper also provides illustrations and examples to demonstrate the impact of price convergence on market efficiency. © 2014 CIGRE.

A wireless communication infrastructure is assumed for the smart meter network. The dynamics of the power market are assumed to be a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by modeling the power load evolution as a two-state Markov chain. The fundamental elements of the MDP are discussed and the optimal strategy is obtained from Dynamic Programming. Due to the curse of dimensions, the myopic strategy is proposed to significantly simplify the algorithm. The validity of the proposed scheduling algorithm is demonstrated using numerical simulations. For example, for price insensitive power users, the average price and power generation errors are reduced by 60% and 40% using the myopic approach, compared with the simple round robin schedule, in certain circumstances. © 2012 IEEE.",,Markov Decision Processes; Myopic strategies; Optimal strategies; Power load; Power markets; Power users; Round-robin schedule; Smart grid; Smart meters; Two-state Markov chains; Wireless communications; Commerce; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Markov processes; Wireless telecommunication systems; Smart power grids

A major task of the Independent Systems Operator (ISO)2 on the wholesale (transmission) level and of the Distribution Utility (DU) on the regional (distribution) level is to monitor the grid and to maintain balance while keeping voltage, frequency, and power factor within very tight bounds. This task gets more challenging as more renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are connected to the grid [2]. Many of these sources (e.g. wind) are only partially predictable. The grid balancing problem has been studied on various levels (wholesale vs. retail) and with different approaches [1]. We study the problem of how to determine the price that energy brokers (retailers) need to pay in case their profile of consumption and production of electricity is imbalanced in the current time slot.3 In a retail electricity market, brokers have the possibility to control some portion of customer production and consumption, such as by offering price concessions in exchange for the ability to remotely interrupt loads or sources for limited periods of time. Examples of such controllable loads are remotely controlled CHPs (Combined Heat and Power - gas turbines that supply both heat and power, and allow some control of production) and domestic water heaters that can be remotely turned off to temporarily reduce consumption. We present two different scenarios and the related market mechanisms to balance supply and demand: I) without controllable loads, and II) with controllable loads for the current time slot. Our main mechanisms for a regional real-time balancing market are efficient, and create an incentive to resolve imbalances in the day-ahead market. An advantage of our methods is that they are compatible with existing energy market structures (keeping the day-ahead market as a given), and therefore the required restructuring would be less disruptive than with other methods currently suggested.",,Balancing market; Balancing problems; Combined heat and power; Controllable loads; Customer production; Day ahead market; Distribution utilities; Domestic water heaters; Electricity market; Existing energies; Heat and power; Independent systems; Market mechanisms; Power factors; Price concessions; Pricing mechanism; Real time; Regional electricity markets; Renewable energy source; Retail electricity markets; Supply and demand; Tight bound; Time slots; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Electric power factor; Electricity; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Water heaters; Economics

The VSC is included in a multi-objective optimal power flow (OPF) that maximizes the social benefit. Ancillary service (reactive power) and system congestion has been considered in the pricing. Effect ofN-1 contingency on pricing is also analyzed. Pricing is decided one day ahead using forecasted demand data. The OPF is solved by linear programming method. The system is divided into three areas for which total transfer capacity (TTC) is calculated by repeated power flow technique. The available transfer capacity decides the amount of congestion that affects the pricing. The voltage stability is ascertained by checking the singularity of the system Jacobian matrix. Finally, effect of line/generator loss on pricing system is studied. The model is tested on modified IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus systems and is implemented using MATLAB programming.",Congestion; N-1 contingency; Pricing structure; System security; Voltage stability constraint,Congestion; N-1 contingencies; Pricing structures; System security; Voltage stability constraints; Commerce; Deregulation; Jacobian matrices; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Costs

Furthermore, price forecasts are paramount when it comes to designing bidding strategies. It is a known fact that electricity prices on the Nord Pool spot market are, in the long run, mainly influenced by the level of water in the reservoirs of the Norwegian and Swedish hydropower plants. However, changes in the water level happen slowly and are therefore not a matter of great relevance when 1 to 36 hour forecasts are made for the prices on Nord Pool spot market. In this paper, the effects of forecasted wind power production on the spot prices in Nord Pool's Western Danish price area (DK-1) are investigated. Moreover, ways of including the forecasted wind power production in a model for the spot price in DK-1 are explored. It turns out that forecasted wind power production has substantial effects on the spot price and even more effects can be found with small modifications. By using conditional parametric models and by converting the forecasted production into a forecasted penetration, a very satisfying degree of explanation can be achieved in forecasting models for the spot prices in DK-1. Given the result of this paper, it is very likely that the same approach to use wind power predictions, will give good results when forecasting the prices on other electricity pools. It is expected that the approach will be highly beneficial both for pools where wind power penetration is relatively high, and for markets with other characteristics, such as regulation markets.",Electricity spot prices; Forecasting; Statistical modeling; Wind power,Bidding strategy; Denmark; Deregulated energy market; Electricity pool; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Forecasting models; Hydropower plants; Parametric models; Power forecast; Price forecasts; Production forecasts; Regulation markets; Spot market; Spot price; Statistical modeling; Wind power penetration; Wind power predictions; Wind power production; Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Exhibitions; Forecasting; Lakes; Reservoirs (water); Water levels; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Electric load forecasting

Under deregulation, a free market approach to buying and selling the electricity is established. In a deregulated power market, electricity producers generally follow a marginal cost based price fixing strategy. Accordingly, each utility firm follows their own pricing strategy in the market. Absence of a general model to determine the optimal electricity price at the generator end leads to non-standard pricing practices by different generators. The proposed model was formulated based on performance incentive and penalty considering peak/off-peak loads, plant load factor and availability of the plant. The developed model was applied to a typical hydroelectric utility in India to determine the electricity price. Results show that the percentage error in estimated value falls within the limits.",Deregulation; Electricity price; Power market; Profit maximization,Deregulated electricity market; Deregulated power markets; Developed model; Electricity price; Electricity prices; Electricity producers; Free market; General model; Generating stations; Marginal costs; Peak load; Percentage error; Plant load factor; Power markets; Pricing practices; Pricing strategy; Profit maximization; Commerce; Costs; Electric generators; Electric substations; Electric utilities; Electric variables measurement; Electricity; Hydroelectric power plants; Mathematical models; Optimization; Profitability; Deregulation

The tariffs for electricity and - optionally - heat created with our pricing model are optimal in terms of the utility's profit and take into account the consumers' predicted behavior, their load curve, the utility's generation prices, and prices for trading electricity on a day-ahead market like the European Energy Exchange (EEX). Furthermore, we analyze the repercussions of different assumptions about consumer behavior on a simulated market with four competing utilities. Consumer demand is modeled using an attraction model that reflects consumer inertia. Consumers will not always change their supplier, even if the total energy bill could be reduced by doing so: First, motivation to search for lower prices and to actually switch one's supplier is low, given the small possible savings. Second, legal constraints may demand a minimal contract duration in some countries. The resulting nonlinear profit optimization problem of the suppliers is solved with a genetic algorithm. By varying the attraction parameters and thus representing different degrees of inertia, we observe different developments of the market.",,Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Genetic algorithms; Information analysis; Profitability; Consumer demands; Day ahead market; Energy suppliers; European energy exchanges; Generation prices; Legal constraint; Profit optimization; Utility markets; Consumer behavior

In the same time, according to us, the paper can be a possible benchmark example of approximate reasoning, used as a fuzzy decision-support system. All three fuzzy tariff models developed in fuzzy environment, integrate some specific features of a deregulated electricity market, as in Romania in this transition period: i) in the market is only a single ""seller"", SC Electrica SA (SCESA), i.e. a single-supplier of electrical energy; ii) because of this, the consumers interests, beginning with 1999, are protected by the National Authority of Settlements from Energy (NASE) through some (social) compulsions; iii) the average price of EE ($/MWh) near our market place is, obviously, a real problem (in our case the markets are from: Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia and Moldavia). Not being a competitive environment, the normal practice used in NASE rules as method of EE pricing are average costs, i.e. total costs divided by total sales. The fuzzy method shows how it is possible to perform sensitivity tests on the EE price function model (by changing the parameters of SCESA and NASE), until can obtain an acceptable and true price can be obtained. In this aim, the three fuzzy models use different rules for pricing: conservative, aggressive, and different order of words concerning the rules, and finally doing a comparation among prices and models. Though the paper will not exhaust all fuzzy rules, doubtlessly, create a way of fuzzy reasoning, as a modality to find an EE price.

But, like many countries, Japan is moving forward with the deregulation of its electric power industry so that any power generation company could sell electric power in the market. The power price, however, will fluctuate inevitably to balance the power supply and demand. A new appropriate market design is indispensable when introducing new market mechanisms in the electric power market to avoid undesirable results of the market. The first stage of deregulation will be the competition between an existing large-scaled power utility and a new power generation company. In this paper we have investigated the wholesale market with competition of these two power companies based on a simulation model approach. Under the competitive situation the effects of exogenous disturbance may bring serious results and we estimated the influence on the market when the price of fossil fuel rises. The conclusion of this study is that several types of Nash equilibriums have been found in the market: the larger the new power generation company becomes, the higher the electricity price under the Nash equilibriums rises. Because of the difference in their structure of generation capacity, the existing large-scaled power utility gets more profit while the new power generation company loses its profit when the price of fossil fuel rises.",Crude Oil Price; Nash Equilibrium; Power Pool Market; Simulation Analysis,Competition; Computer simulation; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Marketing; Mathematical models; Crude Oil Price; Nash Equilibrium; Power Pool Markets; Simulation Analysis; Electric power systems

Since there are multiple existing state estimators distributed with different owners in one ISO/RTO/Mega-RTO, these neighboring estimators in single power market can exchange their data, where the term 'data' refers to both raw instrumentation data and estimation results of other estimators. It has been demonstrated in our previous publications that carefully selected data exchange schemes improve the quality of estimators in individual entities on both estimation reliability and accuracy. In addition, data exchange is critical for the newly proposed textured distributed state estimation algorithm over the whole Mega-RTO grid. Since all the activities in a market environment need to be evaluated in terms of 'price', the following questions then arise: how to price data exchange activities in a power market? And how to search for the most valuable data exchange schemes in term of market price? In this paper a pricing methodology for data exchange is proposed based on the concept of marginal price. Furthermore, a systematic approach to search for the most valuable data exchange schemes is proposed based on some heuristic rules.

This situation threatened not only aluminium smelting capacity, but also Bonneville's financial condition, which depends heavily on aluminium power sales revenue.
