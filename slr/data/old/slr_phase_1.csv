Westgaard S., Fleten S.-E., Negash A., Botterud A., Bogaard K., Verling T.H.;Performing price scenario analysis and stress testing using quantile regression: A case study of the Californian electricity market;2021;Energy;;This paper uses quantile regression to demonstrate how electricity price distributions are linked to fundamental supply and demand variables. It investigates the California electricity market (zone SP15) for selected trading hours using data from January 8, 2013 to September 24, 2016. The approach quantifies a non-linear relationship between the fundamentals and electricity prices, just as predicted by the merit order curve. Natural gas, greenhouse gas allowance prices and load all have a positive effect on electricity prices, with the effect increasing with the quantiles. In contrast, solar production and wind production both have a negative effect on electricity prices. The effect of solar production increases with quantiles, whereas the effect of wind production decreases with quantiles. This paper also includes a stress testing case study in which a producer faces the risk of high solar and wind production, and investigates the effect on the lower tail of the price distribution. Overall, the results demonstrate how the proposed approach can be a helpful risk management tool for participants in the electricity market. © 2020 The Author(s);"California electricity market; Quantile regression; Risk management";"Costs; Electric industry; Greenhouse gases; Power markets; Risk management; Electricity prices; Non-linear relationships; Price scenarios; Quantile regression; Solar and winds; Solar production; Stress Testing; Supply and demand; Greenhouse effect; electricity; energy market; performance assessment; regression analysis; scenario analysis; testing method; California; United States";4;2;1;2
Jasiński T.;Use of new variables based on air temperature for forecasting day-ahead spot electricity prices using deep neural networks: A new approach;2020;Energy;;The paper presents a way of creating three new, innovative variables based on air temperature to be used in forecasts of electricity demand and prices. The forecasting methods developed so far, especially in the area of energy prices, either did not use temperature data or were based on data that had not undergone pre-processing, which made it difficult for the model to use their potential. Newly developed variables have a linear relationship with the demand for electricity. This paper describes in detail the procedure for determining the parameters of new variables using the electricity market in Poland (a country in Central Europe) as a case study. The proposed approach allows both to avoid data clustering into different seasons and to precisely determine the temperatures at which the nature of the dependence with the demand for electricity changes. The validity of the proposed new variables in prognostic models has been confirmed by their use in deep neural networks. The proposed approach allows reducing the sMAPE by up to 15.3%. The designed new explanatory variables can be used not only in models based on artificial intelligence tools, but also in other forecasting methods that allow the use of exogenous inputs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;"Air temperature-based variable; Artificial neural network; Electricity price; Forecasting";"Atmospheric temperature; Clustering algorithms; Costs; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Neural networks; Artificial intelligence tools; Electricity demands; Explanatory variables; Forecasting methods; Linear relationships; Prognostic model; Spot electricity prices; Temperature data; Power markets; air temperature; artificial neural network; computer simulation; demand-side management; electricity supply; energy planning; forecasting method; price determination; Poland [Central Europe]";5;2;1;1
Narajewski M., Ziel F.;Ensemble forecasting for intraday electricity prices: Simulating trajectories;2020;Applied Energy;;Recent studies concerning the point electricity price forecasting have shown evidence that the hourly German Intraday Continuous Market is weak-form efficient. Therefore, we take a novel, advanced approach to the problem. A probabilistic forecasting of the hourly intraday electricity prices is performed by simulating trajectories in every trading window to receive a realistic ensemble to allow for more efficient intraday trading and redispatch. A generalized additive model is fitted to the price differences with the assumption that they follow a zero-inflated distribution, precisely a mixture of the Dirac and the Student's t-distributions. Moreover, the mixing term is estimated using a high-dimensional logistic regression with lasso penalty. We model the expected value and volatility of the series using i.a. autoregressive and no-trade effects or load, wind and solar generation forecasts and accounting for the non-linearities in e.g. time to maturity. Both the in-sample characteristics and forecasting performance are analysed using a rolling window forecasting study. Multiple versions of the model are compared to several benchmark models and evaluated using probabilistic forecasting measures and significance tests. The study aims to forecast the price distribution in the German Intraday Continuous Market in the last 3 h of trading, but the approach allows for application to other continuous markets, especially in Europe. The results prove superiority of the mixture model over the benchmarks gaining the most from the modelling of the volatility. They also indicate that the introduction of XBID reduced the market volatility. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;"Continuous-trade markets; Electricity price forecasting; Ensemble forecasting; Generalized additive models; Intraday market; Lasso; Logistic regression; Power markets; Probabilistic forecasting; Scenario simulation; Short-term forecasting; Trajectories; XBID; Zero-inflated distribution";"Commerce; Costs; Logistic regression; Mixtures; Solar power generation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Ensemble forecasting; Forecasting performance; Generalized additive model; Market volatility; Probabilistic forecasting; Student's t distribution; Forecasting; electricity; ensemble forecasting; market conditions; performance assessment; price determination; simulation; Europe";4;1;2;2
Heydari A., Majidi Nezhad M., Pirshayan E., Astiaso Garcia D., Keynia F., De Santoli L.;Short-term electricity price and load forecasting in isolated power grids based on composite neural network and gravitational search optimization algorithm;2020;Applied Energy;2;Electricity price forecasting is a key aspect for market participants to maximize their economic efficiency in deregulated markets. Nevertheless, due to its non-linearity and non-stationarity, the trend of the price is usually complicated to predict. On the other hand, the accuracy of short-term electricity price and load forecasting is fundamental for an efficient management of electric systems. An accurate prediction can benefit future plans and economic operations of the power systems’ operators. In this paper, a new and accurate combined model has been proposed for short-term load forecasting and short-term price forecasting in deregulated power markets. It includes variational mode decomposition, mix data modeling, feature selection, generalized regression neural network and gravitational search algorithm. A mixed data model for the price and load forecast has been considered and integrated with the original signal series of price and load and their decomposition. Throughout this model, the candidate input variables are chosen by a distinct hybrid feature selection. Two reliable electricity markets (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland and Spanish electricity markets) have been used to test the proposed forecasting model and the obtained results have been compared with different valid benchmark prediction models. Lastly, the real load data of Favignana Island's power grid have been considered to test the proposed model. The obtained results pinpointed that the proposed model's precision and stability is higher than in other benchmark forecasting models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;"Electricity price forecasting; Feature selection; Generalized Regression Neural Network; Load forecasting; Optimization algorithm; Power grid management";"Deregulation; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Predictive analytics; Deregulated power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Generalized regression neural networks; Gravitational search algorithms; Hybrid feature selections; Short term load forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Spanish electricity markets; Electric load forecasting; algorithm; artificial neural network; benchmarking; electricity generation; electricity supply; forecasting method; market conditions; nonlinearity; optimization; power plant; precision; prediction; Aegadian Islands; Favignana; Italy; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; Sicily; Trapani; United States";5;2;2;1
Halužan M., Verbič M., Zorić J.;Performance of alternative electricity price forecasting methods: Findings from the Greek and Hungarian power exchanges;2020;Applied Energy;1;This paper evaluates the performance of alternative algorithms for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. Forecasting performance is assessed based on evidence from the Greek and Hungarian Power Market simulation. The electricity price formation process is simulated on a long time series spanning from January 2015 to September 2018. The EPF models are structured upon the explanatory variables that are available to the market participants before the exchange gate closure, through the publicly available ENTSO-E transparency platform. Relationships between the electricity spot price and explanatory variables are estimated by the selected econometric, data mining, and machine learning algorithms. The econometric autoregressive model with exogeneous explanatory variables is a benchmark model, as the other alternative approaches are used to overcome the linearity bias in the ordinary least squares estimator. We analyse the impact of a different training sample size as well as the impact of training on an hourly clustered sample on the forecasting performance. The support vector machine algorithm turned out to be the best alternative approach, with the lowest mean absolute error and statistically confirmed better forecasts compared to the benchmark econometric autoregressive model. The majority of the tested algorithms perform better with smaller training samples, whereas neural network based approaches prefer large training samples. Models with hourly clustered training samples have higher accuracy based on the Hungarian evidence, while hourly non-clustered training is a superior training method based on the Greek findings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;"Artificial neural networks; Data mining; Electricity price forecasting; ENTSOE-E transparency platform; Greek power exchange; Hungarian power exchange; Learning sample size; Machine learning; Rolling-window";"Data mining; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Power quality; Sampling; Support vector machines; Alternative algorithms; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Forecasting performance; Network-based approach; Ordinary least squares estimators; Power market simulation; Support vector machine algorithm; Power markets; accuracy assessment; algorithm; alternative energy; artificial neural network; econometrics; error analysis; machine learning; numerical model; performance assessment; support vector machine; time series; vector autoregression; Alfold; Hungary";5;1;2;1
Lisi F., Shah I.;Forecasting next-day electricity demand and prices based on functional models;2020;Energy Systems;;Efficient modeling and forecasting of electricity demand and prices is an important issue in competitive electricity markets. This work investigates the forecasting performance of several models for the 1-day-ahead prediction of demand and prices on four electricity markets (APX Power-UK, Nord Pool, PJM and IPEX). All the models are based on two steps: a nonparametric estimation of some deterministic components, followed by the choice of a suitable model for the residual stochastic component. This latter step includes univariate and multivariate as well as parametric and nonparametric models, with particular emphasis on the functional approach, that models the whole daily profile as a single functional observation. More specifically, the models involved are: a linear model and a nonlinear (nonparametric) autoregressive model, a vector autoregressive model and four autoregressive functional specifications. Prediction covers a whole year. Comparisons are based both on descriptive statistics and on statistical tests of equal forecasting accuracy. Though results partly depend on specific markets, a double functional model always proved to be the best- or no different from the best-model, highlighting the effectiveness of the functional approach. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;"APX, NP, IPEX, PJM; Electricity demand forecasting; Electricity prices forecasting; Functional models; Nonparametric models";"Commerce; Costs; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; APX, NP, IPEX, PJM; Electricity demand forecasting; Electricity prices forecasting; Functional model; Non-parametric model; Power markets";4;2;2;2
Ribeiro M.H.D.M., Stefenon S.F., Lima J.D.D., Nied A., Mariani V.C., Coelho L.D.S.;Electricity price forecasting based on self-adaptive decomposition and heterogeneous ensemble learning;2020;Energies;;Electricity price forecasting plays a vital role in the financial markets. This paper proposes a self-adaptive, decomposed, heterogeneous, and ensemble learning model for short-term electricity price forecasting one, two, and three-months-ahead in the Brazilian market. Exogenous variables, such as supply, lagged prices and demand are considered as inputs signals of the forecasting model. Firstly, the coyote optimization algorithm is adopted to tune the hyperparameters of complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition in the pre-processing phase. Next, three machine learning models, including extreme learning machine, gradient boosting machine, and support vector regression models, as well as Gaussian process, are designed with the intent of handling the components obtained through the signal decomposition approach with focus on time series forecasting. The individual forecasting models are directly integrated in order to obtain the final forecasting prices one to three-months-ahead. In this case, a grid of forecasting models is obtained. The best forecasting model is the one that has better generalization out-of-sample. The empirical results show the efficiency of the proposed model. Additionally, it can achieve forecasting errors lower than 4.2% in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error. The ranking of importance of the variables, from the smallest to the largest is, lagged prices, demand, and supply. This paper provided useful insights for multi-step-ahead forecasting in the electrical market, once the proposed model can enhance forecasting accuracy and stability. © 2020 by the authors.

Ghasemi-Marzbali A.;A developed short-term electricity price and load forecasting method based on data processing, support vector machine, and virus colony search;2020;Energy Efficiency;;Surely, electricity market participants need an accurate estimate for the price and load signals to properly manage their programs to increase their profits. Regarding the two-way interaction between suppliers and consumers, they are able to manage their required profile. Therefore, the individual price or load forecasting is not acceptable and cannot capture their related pattern. Therefore, this paper presents a new forecasting method for price and load signals in simultaneous configuration. This method consists of three main parts: the first part proposes two data preprocessing methods based on wavelet transform to remove noisy term and mutual information to select best features with maximum relevancy and minimum redundancy. The second part suggests a learning engine based on a least square support vector machine (LSSVM) with self-adaptive kernel functions and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) time series to extract the linear and nonlinear patterns. Finally, the last part employs a new modified virus colony search algorithm (VCS) to efficiently set the LSSVM control parameters to use its all capacity. Simulations are carried out for three well-known Australia’s, New York’s, and Ontario’s electricity markets. The obtained results show the acceptable results. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.;"Feature selection; Optimization; Price/load forecast; Smart grid; Support vector machine; Wavelet transform";"Data handling; Electric power plant loads; Forecasting; Learning systems; Power markets; Support vector machines; Viruses; Wavelet transforms; Adaptive kernel functions; Data preprocessing; Forecasting methods; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity; Least square support vector machines; Market participants; Mutual informations; Two-way interaction; Electric load forecasting; algorithm; data processing; electricity supply; forecasting method; optimization; pattern recognition; price determination; smart grid; support vector machine; transform";5;1;1;1
Zhang Y., Deng C., Zhao R., leto S.;A novel integrated price and load forecasting method in smart grid environment based on multi-level structure;2020;Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence;;Prediction of load and price are two critical key in power system planning and operation. Most of the recent works in this area forecast the load and price signals separately but, a dynamic model in smart grid is evaluated while, the customers may have opportunity to react the proposed prices changing through shifting the electricity usages from expensive to cheaper hours. So, the load and price signals are coupled strongly which made the previous prediction models ineffective. In this research, a synthetic prediction approach has been proposed by considering the load and price signals, simultaneously. This method works as multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model based on least square support vector machine (LSSVM) forecast engine. Furthermore, a dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) is suggested in this approach to decompose the original signal into different small sub-signals. Beside of that, the modified mutual information (MMI) filter has been used to choose the best candidate input of forecast engine. The learning section is also coupled with novel modified optimization algorithm based on gravitational search algorithm (GSA) which called as modified GSA (MGSA). Finally, various forecasting errors have been considered as average mean absolute percentage error and error variance to get the comparison outcomes and performance of forecasting approaches. For this purpose, different markets have been considered as test case to show the efficiency of suggested approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;"DWT; Feature selection; Load and price prediction; LSSVM; MIMO model; Smart grids";"Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission networks; Engines; Errors; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; MIMO systems; Predictive analytics; Signal processing; Smart power grids; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Dyadic wavelet transform; Gravitational search algorithm (GSA); Least square support vector machines; Mean absolute percentage error; Multi-input-multi-output models; Optimization algorithms; Power system planning and operation; Price and load forecasting; Electric load forecasting";5;1;1;1
Motamedi Sedeh O., Ostadi B.;Optimization of bidding strategy in the day-ahead market by consideration of seasonality trend of the market spot price;2020;Energy Policy;;Due to the liberalization of the electricity market, evaluation of competitor behaviors, as an uncertainty factor, is a critical information for a Generation Company (GenCo) to maximize its profit by optimizing bidding strategies. In this paper, a new bidding strategy model has been presented based on the Genetic Algorithm and a refined Monte Carlo simulation model. This process is done through the similarity function and consideration of the seasonality trend as the main characteristic of the electricity spot price. The main contributions of this paper include: (a): Consideration of the similarity value for all days in historical dates in the database, (b): Consideration of the seasonality trend of market clearing price by applying K-Means algorithm for clustering historical data based on demand, (c): Application of the proposed model for each cluster's data, (d): Performance evaluation of the fitness function of each generated strategy by a simulation model based on historical data. The proposed model has been tested for the 10 subsets of Iran's electricity market 2016. The obtained results show that the proposed model is statistically efficient, and the prediction accuracy of MCP by the proposed model can be improved by more than 25% and 11% compared with a simple simulation model and the hybrid of simulation and Q-learning model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;"Deregulated market; Genetic algorithm; Monte Carlo simulation; Pay-as-bid; Similarity function";"Electric industry; Function evaluation; Genetic algorithms; K-means clustering; Monte Carlo methods; Reinforcement learning; Day ahead market; Electricity spot price; Fitness functions; Generation companies; Market Clearing Price; Prediction accuracy; Similarity functions; Uncertainty factors; Power markets; computer simulation; electricity supply; genetic algorithm; Monte Carlo analysis; optimization; price dynamics; seasonality; Iran";5;1;1;1
Fu T., Zhang S., Wang C.;Application and research for electricity price forecasting system based on multi-objective optimization and sub-models selection strategy;2020;Soft Computing;;In general, electricity prices reflect the cost to build, finance, maintain, and operate power plants and the electricity grid. Therefore, the cost-optimized scheduling of industrial loads with accurate price forecasts is very important. As such, recent studies have attempted to combine models to forecast electricity prices more accurately. Earlier combined models have tended to ignore the selection of sub-models and data analyses, leading to poor forecasting performance. In order to select the best forecasting models in a combined model, we propose a hybrid electricity price forecasting system that includes a data analysis module, a sub-model selection strategy module, optimized forecasting processing, and a model evaluation module. As such, the hybrid system fully exploits the advantages of a single model, thus improving the forecasting performance of the combined model. The experimental results show that the proposed system selects optimal sub-models effectively and successfully identifies future trend changes in the electricity price. Thus, the system can be an effective tool in the planning and implementation of smart grids. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;"Combined model; Electricity prices; Hybrid forecasting system; Sub-models selection strategy";"Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Multiobjective optimization; Power plants; Electricity grids; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting models; Forecasting performance; Industrial loads; Model evaluation; Price forecasts; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Muniain P., Ziel F.;Probabilistic forecasting in day-ahead electricity markets: Simulating peak and off-peak prices;2020;International Journal of Forecasting;6;"In this article we include dependency structures for electricity price forecasting and forecasting evaluation. We work with off-peak and peak time series from the German-Austrian day-ahead price; hence, we analyze bivariate data. We first estimate the mean of the two time series, and then in a second step we estimate the residuals. The mean equation is estimated by ordinary least squares and the elastic net, and the residuals are estimated by maximum likelihood. Our contribution is to include a bivariate jump component in a mean reverting jump diffusion model in the residuals. The models’ forecasts are evaluated with use of four different criteria, including the energy score to measure whether the correlation structure between the time series is properly included. It is observed that the models with bivariate jumps provide better results with the energy score, which means that it is important to consider this structure to properly forecast correlated time series. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters";"Bivariate Bernoulli; Dependency structure; Elastic net estimation; Electricity price forecasting; Energy score; Ensemble forecasting; Forecasting evaluation; GARCH; Jump diffusion process; Pinball score";;3, 4;2;1;2
Fang X., Cui M.;Analytical model of day-ahead and real-time price correlation in strategic wind power offering;2020;Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy;;In this paper, the model of strategic wind power offering in the day-ahead (DA) market is proposed considering the uncertainties of wind power production, and price forecasting of DA and real-time (RT) market. The wind power deviation in the RT market is settled with the two-price mechanism based on the deviation direction and the relation between the locational marginal prices (LMPs) of DA and RT. Instead of using the point forecasting for the DA and RT LMPs, the uncertainties of LMP forecasting are modeled. In addition, the correlation between the forecasting errors of DA and RT LMP are directly modeled instead of generating the correlated scenarios. Finally, the opitmal offered quantity of wind power in the DA market is derived using the probability theory based on the probabilistic wind power forecasting. The case study using the price data of actual DA and RT from Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) validates the effectiveness of the proposed model. It shows that the correlation of the forecasting errors of DA and RT LMP has a significant impact on the wind power quantity offered by DA and revenue results. © 2020, Springer.

Marcjasz G.;Forecasting electricity prices using deep neural networks: A robust hyper-parameter selection scheme;2020;Energies;1;Deep neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity. However, their application requires setting multiple hyper-parameters, and the performance relies strongly on this choice. We address this issue and propose a robust ex-ante hyper-parameter selection procedure for the day-ahead electricity price forecasting that, when used jointly with a tested forecast averaging scheme, yields high performance throughout three-year long out-of-sample test periods in two distinct markets. Being based on a grid search with models evaluated on long samples, the methodology mitigates the noise induced by local optimization. Forecast averaging across calibration window lengths and hyper-parameter sets allows the proposed methodology to outperform a parameter-rich least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-estimated model and a deep neural network (DNN) with non-optimized hyper-parameters in terms of the mean absolute forecast error. © 2020 by the author.

Lee C.-Y., Wu C.-E.;Short-term electricity price forecasting based on similar day-based neural network;2020;Energies;;This paper presents four refined distance models to the application of forecasting short-term electricity price namely Euclidean norm, Manhattan distance, cosine coefficient, and Pearson correlation coefficient. The four refined models were constructed and used to select the days, which are like a reference day in electricity prices and loads, called similar days in this study. Using the similar days, the electricity prices of a forecast day were further obtained by similar day regression (SDR) and similar day based artificial neural network (SDANN). The simulation results of the case of the PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) interchange energy market indicate the superiority and availability of the selection 45 framework days and three similar days based on Pearson correlation coefficient model. © 2020 by the authors.

Zheng K., Wang Y., Liu K., Chen Q.;Locational Marginal Price Forecasting: A Componential and Ensemble Approach;2020;IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid;1;Short-term locational marginal price (LMP) forecasting is the traditional problem of market participants and other institutions maximizing their profit. Most electricity market organizers in the world release the data of LMP along with its three components, i.e., the energy, congestion, and loss components. The series of the three components have their own patterns and driving factors, and can be utilized to improve the accuracy of LMP forecasting. However, most existing studies have focused on direct LMP forecasting and have barely noticed this characteristic. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between the released data of the three components and LMP forecasting through a componential and ensemble approach. Three individual forecasting models are selected and trained for these components, and an ensemble framework that stacks the summation LMP results and the direct results is proposed to enhance the overall accuracy and robustness. Numerical experiments with real market data are conducted to show the good performance of this novel approach. © 2010-2012 IEEE.;"electricity market; Locational marginal price; model stacking%; short-term forecasting; tree-based regression";"Power markets; Driving factors; Ensemble approaches; Forecasting models; Locational marginal price forecasting; Market participants; Numerical experiments; Overall accuracies; Three component; Forecasting";4;1;1;1
Rogus R., Castro R., Sołtysik M.;Comparative analysis of wind energy generation forecasts in Poland and Portugal and their influence on the electricity exchange prices;2020;Inventions;;Currently, the privileged position of wind energy producers is being weakened by their enforced participation in the market on equal terms. This requires accurate production forecasting. The main aim of this study is to comparatively examine the wind generation forecasts in Poland and Portugal, as well as to verify their influence on the day-ahead market prices. The statistical analysis revealed significant deviations of the forecasted and actual wind production in both countries, which referred to the corresponding spot and balancing prices caused considerable financial losses by the wind energy suppliers. In this paper, the influence of the wind generation forecasts on the spot prices has been examined through developed the auto-regressive moving average (ARMA), ARMA with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) and non-linear auto-regressive neural network (NAR), NAR with exogenous inputs (NARX)artificial neural network (ANN) models. The results have shown that the usability of the information of forecasted wind generation is not unequivocal in models developed for spot prices in Poland, mainly because of the randomness and volatility of recorded wind generation forecasts. However, in the case of Portugal, the forecasted wind generation occurred to be a valuable input in spot prices models, which results in an improvement in the models’ accuracy. © 2020 by the authors.

Janke T., Steinke F.;Probabilistic multivariate electricity price forecasting using implicit generative ensemble post-processing;2020;2020 International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems, PMAPS 2020 - Proceedings;;The reliable estimation of forecast uncertainties is crucial for risk-sensitive optimal decision making. In this paper, we propose implicit generative ensemble post-processing, a novel framework for multivariate probabilistic electricity price forecasting. We use a likelihood-free implicit generative model based on an ensemble of point forecasting models to generate multivariate electricity price scenarios with a coherent dependency structure as a representation of the joint predictive distribution. Our ensemble post-processing method outperforms well-established model combination benchmarks. This is demonstrated on a data set from the German day-Ahead market. As our method works on top of an ensemble of domain-specific expert models, it can readily be deployed to other forecasting tasks. © 2020 IEEE.;"electricity price forecasting; ensemble learning; implicit generative models; Probabilistic forecasting";"Forecasting; Processing; Risk perception; Dependency structures; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Ensemble post-processing; Forecast uncertainty; Forecasting models; Optimal decision making; Predictive distributions; Power markets";4;1;1;2
Yang H., Schell K.R.;HFNet: Forecasting Real-Time Electricity Price via Novel GRU Architectures;2020;2020 International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems, PMAPS 2020 - Proceedings;;Electricity price forecasting is critical to numerous tasks in the power system such as strategic bidding, generation scheduling, optimal scheduling of storage reserves and system analysis. Most existing price forecasting models focus on hourly prediction for the day ahead market. This work focuses on the real-Time, 5-minute market, with the goal of developing a model able to capture both the long-and short-Term temporal distribution of the data. Extending the recent advances in deep learning models of time series forecasting, the proposed model-named HFnet-is a novel multi-branch Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture for electricity price forecasting. Extensive empirical analyses using real-Time data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) illustrate the value of the proposed model when compared to state-of-Art prediction models, with an average reduction in error of 10%. © 2020 IEEE.;"Deep Learning; feature engineering; GRU; price forecasting; Time Series Analysis; wavelet";"Deep learning; Digital storage; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Scheduling; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Empirical analysis; Generation scheduling; Independent system operators; Optimal scheduling; Strategic bidding; Temporal distribution; Power markets";5;1;1;1
MacIejowska K., Uniejewski B., Serafin T.;PCA forecast averaging - Predicting day-ahead and intraday electricity prices;2020;Energies;;Recently, the development in combining point forecasts of electricity prices obtained with different length of calibration windows have provided an extremely efficient and simple tool for improving predictive accuracy. However, the proposed methods are strongly dependent on expert knowledge and may not be directly transferred from one to another model or market. Hence, we consider a novel extension and propose to use principal component analysis (PCA) to automate the procedure of averaging over a rich pool of predictions. We apply PCA to a panel of over 650 point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows length. The robustness of the approach is evaluated with three different forecasting tasks, i.e., forecasting day-ahead prices, forecasting intraday ID3 prices one day in advance, and finally very short term forecasting of ID3 prices (i.e., six hours before delivery). The empirical results are compared using the Mean Absolute Error measure and Giacomini and White test for conditional predictive ability (CPA). The results indicate that PCA averaging not only yields significantly more accurate forecasts than individual predictions but also outperforms other forecast averaging schemes. © 2020 by the authors.;"Day-ahead market; Decision-making; Electricity price forecasting; EPF; Forecast averaging; Intraday market; Principal component analysis";"Calibration; Costs; Day-ahead prices; Electricity prices; Expert knowledge; Individual prediction; Mean absolute error; Predictive abilities; Predictive accuracy; Very short term forecasting; Forecasting";5;1;1;2

Gulay E., Duru O.;Hybrid modeling in the predictive analytics of energy systems and prices;2020;Applied Energy;;The aim of this paper is to illustrate the nature of the residuals of a forecasting process and to propose a hybrid approach with linear and nonlinear components predicted by corresponding methodologies. It is a common practice that residuals are assumed to be unpredictable or are reiterated into a model as lagged variables to capture any information remaining in the residual data. The central argument of this paper is that residuals from energy price forecasting can still carry predictive information in its complex and nonlinear form. Although the linear modeling is initially very accurate, reiterating residuals in linear structures is a mismatch of data type and methodology. In this regard, the proposed algorithm hybridizes or combines linear components captured by the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) and nonlinear components processed by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve post-sample accuracy. The conventional reiterative process can improve in-sample accuracy, which literally has no value for business forecasting practices. Through a fair benchmark comparison, including methodologies of other combinations, the proposed algorithm is cross-validated by predictive accuracy gain in the out-of-sample (holdout) dataset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;"Combination forecasting; Energy markets; Energy prices; Price discovery; Price forecasting; Residual modeling";"Costs; Forecasting; Neural networks; Signal processing; Autoregressive distributed lag models; Benchmark comparison; Business forecasting; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Linear components; Nonlinear components; Predictive accuracy; Predictive information; Predictive analytics; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial neural network; data set; energy market; forecasting method";4, 5;2;1;1

The electricity prices have an impact on the behavior of market participants, and thus, predicting prices for generation companies, and consumers is essential for both the short-term profits in the Day-Ahead, Intra-Day and Ancillary markets, and the long-term benefits in the future planning, investment, and risk management. Therefore, participants in the electricity market need to accurately and effectively predict the price signal to manage market risk. In this paper, different forecasting models have been compared, and the most promising ones have been employed to forecast the short term Italian electricity market clearing price for achieving forecasting accuracy. In particular, simulations are performed for four principal regression methods, including Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Processes Regression, Regression Trees, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. The performance of predicted models is compared through several performance metrics, including MAE, RMSE, R, and the total number of percentage error anomalies. The results indicate the SVM is the best choice for forecasting the electricity market price on the Italian case study. © 2020 IEEE.;"Artificial neural network; Electricity price prediction; Italian electricity market; Machine learning; PUN";"Consumer behavior; Costs; Decision making; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Forecasting; Investments; Multilayer neural networks; Profitability; Risk management; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting models; Gaussian processes regressions; Generation companies; Market Clearing Price; Market participants; Multi layer perceptron; Performance metrics; Power markets";5;1;1;1

As a result, electricity can be easily purchased and sold across further areas and countries. On the other hand, trying to guarantee renewable projects profitability, Power Purchase Agreements and Options contracts are arising as a feasible solution. The problem arises when the power plant owners have to negotiate the purchase electricity price in order to optimize risks and profits, as well as make future plans. Thus, several methods for Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) have been developed and presented, showing different results, as market spot prices suffer from strong seasonality, spikes and high volatility. In this paper, three methods, based on Deep Learning Dynamic Neural Networks (NAR, NARX and LSTM) applied to forecast MIBEL electricity spot prices are discussed in order to evaluate their adequacy, accuracy and reliable horizon. © 2020 IEEE.;"Deep Learning Dynamic Neural Networks; Electricity Markets; Electricity Price Forecasting; LSTM; NAR; NARX; Time Series";"Costs; Deep neural networks; Deregulation; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Power markets; Profitability; Sales; Dynamic neural networks; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Feasible solution; High volatility; Power purchase agreement; Renewable projects; Deep learning";5;1;1;1
Roungkvist J.S., Enevoldsen P., Xydis G.;High-resolution electricity spot price forecast for the danish power market;2020;Sustainability (Switzerland);1;Energy markets with a high penetration of renewables are more likely to be challenged by price variations or volatility, which is partly due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy. The Danish electricity market (DK1) is a great example of such a market, as 49% of the power production in DK1 is based on wind power, conclusively challenging the electricity spot price forecast for the Danish power market. The energy industry and academia have tried to find the best practices for spot price forecasting in Denmark, by introducing everything from linear models to sophisticated machine-learning approaches. This paper presents a linear model for price forecasting-based on electricity consumption, thermal power production, wind production and previous electricity prices-to estimate long-term electricity prices in electricity markets with a high wind penetration levels, to help Utilities and asset owners to develop risk management strategies and for asset valuation. © 2020 by the authors.;"Big data; Electricity spot price forecast; Power markets; Renewable energy; Wind power";"academic research; best management practice; electricity generation; energy market; estimation method; machine learning; price dynamics; stochasticity; wind power; Denmark";5;1;1;1

Forecasting electricity prices is an important issue for all electricity market participants. In this study, we shed light on how to improve electricity price forecasting accuracy through the use of a machine learning technique-namely, a novel genetic programming approach. Drawing on empirical data from the largest EU energy markets, we propose a forecasting model that considers variables related to weather conditions, oil prices, and CO2 coupons and predicts energy prices 24 h ahead. We show that the proposed model provides more accurate predictions of future electricity prices than existing prediction methods.

Considering all the potent factors in determining the electricity prices - some of which have stochastic nature - makes this a cumbersome task. In this article, first, Grey correlation analysis is applied to select the effective parameters in EPF problem and eliminate redundant factors based on low correlation grades. Then, a deep neural network with stacked denoising auto-encoders has been utilized to denoise data sets from different sources individually. After that, to detect the main features of the input data and putting aside the unnecessary features, dimension reduction process is implemented. Finally, the rough structure artificial neural network (ANN) has been executed to forecast the day-ahead electricity price. The proposed method is implemented on the data of Ontario, Canada, and the forecasted results are compared with different structures of ANN, support vector machine, long short-term memory - benchmarking methods in this field - and forecasting data reported by independent electricity system operator (IESO) to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the results of this article indicate that the proposed method is efficient in terms of reducing error criterion and improves the forecasting error about 5-10 percent in comparison with IESO. This is a remarkable achievement in EPF field. © 2005-2012 IEEE.;"Deep learning (DL); denoising; dimension reduction (DR); price forecasting; rough neuron";"Deep neural networks; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; De-noising; Deregulated energy market; Dimension reduction; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity System Operators; Grey correlation analysis; Price forecasting; Rough neuron; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Wang J., Yang W., Du P., Niu T.;Outlier-robust hybrid electricity price forecasting model for electricity market management;2020;Journal of Cleaner Production;5;Electricity market management is of great importance for cleaner production in the development of society. However, despite this significance, electricity price forecasting remains a challenging task. Hybrid models are widely employed for forecasting electricity price, which has the characteristics of being non-stationarity, random, and non-linear. Despite their success, current hybrid models require improvement. In particular, data preprocessing, artificial intelligence optimization, feature selection, and basic forecasting engine selection should be considered. In this study, in addition to these issues, we consider the negative influence of outliers on the modeling of electricity price. In particular, a novel outlier-robust hybrid model is developed for forecasting electricity price, which combines a basic forecasting engine called outlier-robust extreme learning machine model and three new algorithms. Specifically, a new optimizer called chaotic sine cosine algorithm is developed to obtain the ideal parameters for phase space reconstruction, and then a novel feature selection method is developed to construct the optimal features in the modeling of electricity price. Moreover, an effective data preprocessing method is proposed for effective forecasting by capturing electricity price features. Subsequently, experiments based on electricity price data from the electricity markets of Australia and Singapore demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to other benchmark models. Further, the model can be a reliable forecasting method not only in electricity market management, but also in modeling time series with complex nonlinear characteristics and outliers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;"Electricity market; Electricity price; Hybrid model; Multi-step forecasting";"Commerce; Electric industry; Engines; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Machine learning; Phase space methods; Pollution control; Statistics; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Extreme learning machine; Feature selection methods; Hybrid model; Multi-step forecasting; Nonlinear characteristics; Phase space reconstruction; Power markets";4, 5;2;1;1
Alshejari A., Kodogiannis V.S., Leonidis S.;Development of neurofuzzy architectures for electricity price forecasting;2020;Energies;1;In 20th century, many countries have liberalized their electricity market. This power markets liberalization has directed generation companies as well as wholesale buyers to undertake a greater intense risk exposure compared to the old centralized framework. In this framework, electricity price prediction has become crucial for any market player in their decision‐making process as well as strategic planning. In this study, a prototype asymmetric‐based neuro‐fuzzy network (AGFINN) architecture has been implemented for short‐term electricity prices forecasting for ISO New England market. AGFINN framework has been designed through two different defuzzification schemes. Fuzzy clustering has been explored as an initial step for defining the fuzzy rules while an asymmetric Gaussian membership function has been utilized in the fuzzification part of the model. Results related to the minimum and maximum electricity prices for ISO New England, emphasize the superiority of the proposed model over well‐established learning‐based models. © 2020 by the authors.;"Clustering; Day‐ahead electricity price forecasting; Neural networks; Neurofuzzy systems; Prediction";"Costs; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Membership functions; Network architecture; Neural networks; Risk management; Asymmetric Gaussian membership functions; Clustering; Defuzzification scheme; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices forecasting; Generation companies; Neuro-fuzzy architectures; Neurofuzzy system; Power markets";5;1;1;2

First, a method for selecting electricity price similarity based on comprehensive influencing factors is designed to select the forecast data set with similar characteristics to the forecast date. The similar daily quantile regression algorithm is then combined with the generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network to construct a quantile neural network electricity price model for obtaining the predicted daily electricity price condition quantile. Finally, the kernel density function is used to convert the predicted daily electricity price condition quantile into the predicted probability density curve to realize short-term electricity price probability prediction. The data of the electricity market of the city of Dayton, Ohio in the United States is used as an example. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of short-term electricity price forecasting. © 2020, The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.;"Electricity market; Probability forecasting; Quantile neural network model; Short-term price forecasting";"Electric industry; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Probability density function; Competitive power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price model; Generalized dynamic fuzzy neural networks; Neural network model; Probability density curve; Probability forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Power markets";5;1;1;2
Yang W., Wang J., Niu T., Du P.;A novel system for multi-step electricity price forecasting for electricity market management;2020;Applied Soft Computing Journal;9;Electricity price forecasting is an important and challenging issue for all participants in the power market because of the wide application of electricity in our society and its inherent features. In this context, some current forecasting systems use data preprocessing and optimization for theoretical and practical achievements. However, some limitations to these systems exist which need to be urgently solved. First, future information is overdrawn in the data preprocessing stage of these forecasting systems, which is actually unknown in practical applications. The crucial question, therefore, is how to develop a forecasting system without using any future information. Second, the complex features of original nonlinear and nonstationary electricity price have a negative influence on the generalization ability of these previously developed models. To decrease the negative effects on management, a method to develop a forecasting system to improve the model's generalization ability is required. Therefore, in this study, we developed an adaptive deterministic and probabilistic interval forecasting system for multi-step electricity price forecasting, which can present more valuable information to power market decision makers. Two cases and one comparative study are provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the developed system in multi-step electricity price forecasting. Furthermore, further discussions are presented to illustrate the significance of this study, thus proving that the results of the present study fill the present knowledge gap and provide some new future directions for related studies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;"Deterministic forecasting; Electricity market; Electricity price; Interval forecasting; Multi-step forecasting";"Commerce; Decision making; Electric industry; Forecasting; Comparative studies; Deterministic forecasting; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting system; Generalization ability; Interval forecasting; Multi-step forecasting; Power markets";5;1;1;2
Shah I., Lisi F.;Forecasting of electricity price through a functional prediction of sale and purchase curves;2020;Journal of Forecasting;4;This work proposes a new approach for the prediction of the electricity price based on forecasting aggregated purchase and sale curves. The basic idea is to model the hourly purchase and the sale curves, to predict them and to find the intersection of the predicted curves in order to obtain the predicted equilibrium market price and volume. Modeling and forecasting of purchase and sale curves is performed by means of functional data analysis methods. More specifically, parametric (FAR) and nonparametric (NPFAR) functional autoregressive models are considered and compared to some benchmarks. An appealing feature of the functional approach is that, unlike other methods, it provides insights into the sale and purchase mechanism connected with the price and demand formation process and can therefore be used for the optimization of bidding strategies. An application to the Italian electricity market (IPEX) is also provided, showing that NPFAR models lead to a statistically significant improvement in the forecasting accuracy. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;"electricity prices; forecasting; functional data; Italian electricity market; sale and purchase curves";"Commerce; Electric industry; Power markets; Sales; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Functional approach; Functional autoregressive models; Functional data analysis; Functional datas; Functional predictions; Modeling and forecasting; Forecasting";4;1;1;2
Bisoi R., Dash P.K., Das P.P.;Short-term electricity price forecasting and classification in smart grids using optimized multikernel extreme learning machine;2020;Neural Computing and Applications;4;Short-term electricity price forecasting in deregulated electricity markets has been studied extensively in recent years but without significant reduction in price forecasting errors. Also demand-side management and short-term scheduling operations in smart grids do not require strictly very accurate forecast and can be executed with certain practical price thresholds. This paper, therefore, presents a multikernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) for both short-term electricity price forecasting and classification according to some prespecified price thresholds. The kernel ELM does not require the hidden layer mapping function to be known and produces robust prediction and classification in comparison with the conventional ELM using random weights between the input and hidden layers. Further in the MKELM formulation, the linear combination of the weighted kernels is optimized using vaporization precipitation-based water cycle algorithm (WCA) to produce significantly accurate electricity price prediction and classification. The combination of MKELM and WCA is named as WCA-MKELM in this work. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, three electricity markets, namely PJM, Ontario and New South Wales, are considered for electricity price forecasting and classification producing fairly accurate results. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.;"Electricity price forecasting and classification; Extreme learning machine; Kernel extreme learning machine; Kernel functions; Mutated water cycle algorithm; Price thresholds";"Commerce; Deregulation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme learning machine; Kernel function; Price thresholds; Water cycle; Power markets";5;2;1;1
Qiao W., Yang Z.;Forecast the electricity price of U.S. using a wavelet transform-based hybrid model;2020;Energy;50;Wavelet transform (WT), as a data preprocessing algorithm, has been widely applied in electricity price forecasting. However, this deterministic-based algorithm does not present stable performance owing to the experiential selection of its orders and layers. For determining the selection of WT's orders and layers in U.S. electricity prices forecasting, this paper designs a crossover experiment with 240 schemes of WT parameter selection and forecasts each scheme with stacked autoencoder (SAE) and long short-term memory (LSTM), generating a novel hybrid model WT-SAE-LSTM. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other AI models, such as back propagation neural network et al., in forecasting accuracy. The best performance of WT-SAE-LSTM in residential, commercial, and industrial electricity price cases obtained by five order four layers, five order four layers, and four order seven layers, where the MAPE is 0.8606%, 0.4719%, and 0.4956%, respectively. Additionally, the difference between the proposed forecasting model and the forecasting result of Energy Information Administration (U.S.) is small. This paper determines the optimal orders and layers of WT in U.S. electricity prices forecasting, which provides an effective reference for the application of WT in other forecasting scenarios and for electricity market participants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;"Electricity price; Energy information administration; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Stacked autoencoder; Wavelet transform";"Backpropagation; Brain; Costs; Forecasting; Power markets; Wavelet transforms; Auto encoders; Back propagation neural networks; Crossover experiments; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity prices forecasting; Energy Information Administration; Forecasting accuracy; Long short-term memory; algorithm; back propagation; electricity; energy market; equipment; forecasting method; numerical model; price dynamics; wavelet analysis; United States";5;2;1;1

To address this issue, a framework has been proposed, in which feature selection has been done by Random Forest (RF) technique in both datasets of load and price. For prediction, RF, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and SVM along with an enhanced linear kernel and tuned parameters are used. New York electricity market data for load (MWh) and price () has been taken for this purpose. Daily and weekly forecasting results have been taken by the proposed system.

Yang S., Xu X., Liu J., Jiang W.;Data-driven analysis of the real-time electricity price considering wind power effect;2020;Energy Reports;;The electricity price is the sensitive signal of the supply–demand balance and some other market incidents. The analysis of the price data can provide plenty of the market information. It is helpful for the participants to understand the market and improve future strategies. However, most of the forecast models eliminate the details to reduce the structural risk for generality. In this paper, the data-driven analysis is proposed to explore the PJM electricity price in detail. The price time series is decomposed into different components. Each component is modeled and tested by the statistical method to illustrate the hidden pattern of the fluctuation, so that there can be reasonable interpretation about the market. The relationship between the price and the wind power is numerically detected through the heterogeneity of the price time series.

Naumzik C., Feuerriegel S.;Forecasting electricity prices with machine learning: predictor sensitivity;2020;International Journal of Energy Sector Management;;"Purpose: Trading on electricity markets occurs such that the price settlement takes place before delivery, often day-ahead. In practice, these prices are highly volatile as they largely depend upon a range of variables such as electricity demand and the feed-in from renewable energy sources. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to provide accurate forecasts. Design/methodology/approach: This paper aims at comparing different predictors stemming from supply-side (solar and wind power generation), demand-side, fuel-related and economic influences. For this reason, this paper implements a broad range of non-linear models from machine learning and draw upon the information-fusion-based sensitivity analysis. Findings: This study disentangles the respective relevance of each predictor. This study shows that external predictors altogether decrease root mean squared errors by up to 21.96%. A Diebold-Mariano test statistically proves that the forecasting accuracy of the proposed machine learning models is superior. Research limitations/implications: The performance gain from including more predictors might be larger than from a better model. Future research should place attention on expanding the data basis in electricity price forecasting. Practical implications: When developing pricing models, practitioners can achieve reasonable performance with a simple model (e.g. seasonal-autoregressive moving-average) that is built upon a wide range of predictors. Originality/value: The benefit of adding further predictors has only recently received traction; however, little is known about how the individual variables contribute to improving forecasts in machine learning. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"Artificial intelligence; Electricity; Forecasting; Neural networks";"Costs; Demand side management; Electric power generation; Forecasting; Machine learning; Mean square error; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Wind power; Autoregressive moving average; Design/methodology/approach; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Machine learning models; Renewable energy source; Root mean squared errors; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Huang C.-J., Shen Y., Chen Y.-H., Chen H.-C.;A novel hybrid deep neural network model for short-term electricity price forecasting;2020;International Journal of Energy Research;;"A Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things is fundamentally an Internet of Things, but focused upon power systems. Being able to predict these prices accurately may help with the identification of customer needs and the effective regulation of the power grid by power producers. It may also help electric power traders to manage risks, make correct decisions, and obtain more benefits. In this paper, a novel hybrid model is proposed for short-term electricity price prediction. The model consists of three algorithms: Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD); a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). This is called SEPNet for convenience. The annual electricity price data is divided into seasons because of seasonal differences in the time series of electricity prices. The VMD algorithm is used to decompose the complex time series of electricity prices into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different center frequencies. The CNN is used to further extract the time-domain features for all the intrinsic model functions in the VMD domain. The GRU is then employed to process and learn the time-domain features extracted by the CNN, leading to the final prediction. A comparison is made with five models, such as LSTM, CNN, VMD-CNN, BP, VMD-ELMAN. The results showed that the proposed model had the best performance, and it was found that using VMD can improve the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the four seasons by 84% and 81%, respectively. The addition of GRU in the SEPNet model further improved the MAPE and RMSE by 19% and 25%, respectively. Including CNN and VMD-CNN, that shows that the proposed model has the best performance. The MAPE and RMSE for the four seasonal averages are 0.730% and 0.453, respectively. This confirms that the SEPNet model has the feasibility and high accuracy to predict short-term electricity prices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd";"convolutional neural network; electricity price forecasting; gated recurrent unit; intrinsic mode function; variational mode decomposition";"Backpropagation; Convolutional neural networks; Costs; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Internet of things; Mean square error; Power markets; Predictive analytics; Time series; Complex time series; Electricity price forecasting; Intrinsic Mode functions; Mean absolute percentage error; Neural network model; Root mean square errors; Seasonal differences; Time domain features; Long short-term memory";5;1;1;1
Gundu V., Simon S.P.;PSO–LSTM for short term forecast of heterogeneous time series electricity price signals;2020;Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing;;Electricity price forecasting plays an important role in the power system network, in order to promote the decision-making process for power generation and consumption. Long term forecasting is not viable as there is an uncertainty in the forecast due to increasing the integration of renewable sources with the existing grids. Since the behavior of the electricity price time sequence signal is highly non-linear and seasonal, deep neural network is the best model for learning the non-linear behavior within the data and for the purpose of forecasting. Hence this paper proposes an enhanced particle swarm optimization based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model, which is used to forecast the closing price of the Indian Energy Exchange. Particle swarm optimization technique is used to optimize the LSTM network input weights, which in turn minimize the forecast error with reduced architecture. This paper discusses the statistical analysis for input data selection and investigates the performance analysis for the optimal selection of layers with hidden units’ combination. Finally, the analysis deploys the best-suited configuration for forecasting the market clearing price with the least mean absolute percentage error. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;"Indian energy exchange (IEX); Long short-term memory (LSTM); Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE); Price forecasting";"Decision making; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Decision making process; Electricity price forecasting; Enhanced particle swarm optimization; Input data selections; Long-term forecasting; Mean absolute percentage error; Particle swarm optimization technique; Power system networks; Long short-term memory";5;1;1;1
Zhang H., Yang Y., Zhang Y., He Z., Yuan W., Yang Y., Qiu W., Li L.;A combined model based on SSA, neural networks, and LSSVM for short-term electric load and price forecasting;2020;Neural Computing and Applications;;"Electricity, a kind of clean energy, has been widely used in people’s production and daily life. However, it is very difficult to estimate the electricity energy production in advance and store the rest of the electric energy due to the climate, environment, population and other factors. Based on data preprocessing and artificial intelligence optimization algorithm, this paper introduces a combined forecasting method. The proposed method contains six individual methods, and each individual method has its own usage. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is adopted to reduce noise from the original data; three individual forecasting methods, Jordan neural network, the echo state network, least squares support vector machine, are applied to obtain the intermediate forecasting results; two optimization algorithms, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing, are used to optimize the parameters of the combined model. This paper not only validates the superiority of the combined model compared to the single predictive model through the simulation experiments of power load data and electricity price data. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of the combined power load and electricity price forecast results are 1.14% and 7.58%, respectively, which are higher than the MAPE error of the corresponding single models prediction results. It has also been verified that the process of eliminating noise by the SSA plays a positive role in the accuracy of the combined forecasting model. In addition, two series of experiments on the power load data lead to two very interesting conclusions. One of the conclusions is that as the size of the test data increases, the prediction accuracy of the model decreases; the other is that the predicted result calculated through the optimized combined weight is better than the combined result calculated using the average weight, and the average weight is used. Weighted combination does not improve the prediction accuracy of a single model. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.";"ESN network; Jordan neural network; LSSVM; Power load and price forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis";"Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Particle size analysis; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Simulated annealing; Spectrum analysis; Support vector machines; Combined forecasting; Echo state networks; Jordan neural networks; Least squares support vector machines; Optimization algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Short term electric load; Singular spectrum analysis; Electric load forecasting";5;1;1;1

But with the increasing proportion of clean energy, it brings new challenges to price forecast. This paper mainly studies how to forecast the electricity price more accurately in the power market which has large proportion of wind power. A new feature called wind load ratio is introduced, which is not only used as a candidate input of the predicted model, but also an important indicator to distinguish day and night.

While literature has focused on forecasting at national and industrial level, this paper focuses on short-term load and price forecasting in residential area. To achieve aforementioned objective, a model is proposed which consists of two stages; feature engineering and forecasting. Feature engineering includes feature extraction and feature selection to reduce dimensionality. Mutual Information (MI) is used for feature extraction. Random forest and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is used for feature selection. For prediction of load and price, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Improved Convolutional Neural Network (ICNN) are used. However, ICNN beats MLP and CNN with 81% accuracy. Prediction performance is evaluated by Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Further, UMASS data set is used for price and load prediction. © 2020 IEEE.";"Convolutional Neural Network; Data Analytics; Load Forecasting; Price Forecasting; Smart Grids";"Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Engineering research; Errors; Extraction; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Mean square error; Power markets; Feature engineerings; Mean absolute error; Mean absolute percentage error; Multi layer perceptron; Mutual informations; Prediction performance; Recursive feature elimination; Root mean square errors; Multilayer neural networks";5;1;1;1

Marcjasz G., Uniejewski B., Weron R.;Beating the naïve-combining lasso with naïve intraday electricity price forecasts;2020;Energies;6;In the last three decades the vast majority of electricity price forecasting (EPF) research has concerned day-ahead markets. However, the rapid expansion of renewable generation-mostly wind and solar-have shifted the focus to intraday markets, which can be used to balance the deviations between positions taken in the day-ahead market and the actual demand and renewable generation. A recent EPF study claims that the German intraday, continuous-time market for hourly products is weak-form efficient, that is, that the best predictor for the so-called ID3-Price index is the most recent transaction price. Here, we undermine this claim and show that we can beat the naïve forecast by combining it with a prediction of a parameter-rich model estimated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We further argue, that that if augmented with timely predictions of fundamental variables for the coming hours, the LASSO-estimated model itself can significantly outperform the naïve forecast. © 2020 by the authors.;"Averaging forecasts; Fundamental variables; ID3-Price index; Intraday electricity market; LASSO; Price forecasting; Variable selection";"Continuous time systems; Forecasting; Fundamental variables; LASSO; Price forecasting; Price index; Variable selection; Power markets";4;1;2;2

However, when the amount of input and output data is large, the training speed will be slow, and it is easy to fall into local extreme values or even the result is difficult to converge. In view of this, the paper proposes a deep learning model based on stacked autoencoder (SAE) to predict electricity price. This paper analyzes the factors affecting electricity price, proposes an algorithm based on Stacked autoencoder model, and uses MATLAB tools to predict electricity price in PJM power market. The comparison between SAE algorithm and BP algorithm is carried out in the example. The results show that the prediction results based on SAE model are more accurate. The deep learning model has better ability to express the objective function than the shallow model, and can effectively solve the problem of traditional neural network training difficulties. © 2019 IEEE.;"Deep learning; Electricity price factor; Electricity price forecasting; stacked autoencoder";"Deep learning; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Artificial neural network methods; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Input and outputs; Learning models; Local extreme values; Neural network training; Objective functions; Learning systems";5;0;1;1
Yamada K., Mori H.;Development of Preconditioned Deep Neural Network for Electricity Price Forecasting;2019;2019 20th International Conference on Intelligent System Application to Power Systems, ISAP 2019;;This paper proposes an efficient method for electricity price forecasting. It is important to understand the behavior of electricity price in advance so that the profit is maximized while the risk is minimized through electric power trading in power markets. The behavior is related to uncertainties as well as high nonlinearity so that more sophisticated methods are required to forecast electricity prices. In this paper, a preconditioned Deep Neural Network (DNN) is proposed to evaluate better predicted values. As the preconditioned technique, k-means is employed to classify electricity prices into some clusters and DNN that consists of Autoencoder and MLP Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is constructed at each cluster. Also, the data increase method with the Gaussian random numbers is presented to improve the precondition technique.

McHugh C., Coleman S., Kerr D., McGlynn D.;Forecasting Day-ahead Electricity Prices with A SARIMAX Model;2019;2019 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2019;;Electricity prices display nonlinear behaviour making it difficult to forecast prices in the market. In addition, various external factors influence electricity prices therefore predicting the day-ahead electricity price is subject to other factors fluctuating. Time-series models learn to follow past market trends and then use historical information as training input to predict future output. This paper focusses on understanding and interpreting statistical approaches for electricity price forecasting and explains these techniques through time-series application with real energy data. The model considered here is a Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model with eXogenous variables (SARIMAX) as electricity prices follow a seasonal pattern controlled by various external factors. By applying algorithm rules for differencing to remove continuing trends, the data becomes stationary and parameters, 14 external factors, are chosen to predict day ahead electricity prices. In the presented experimental results, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was reasonably low and the model accurately predicted electricity prices. © 2019 IEEE.;"electricity price forecasting; exogenous variables; SARIMAX modelling; seasonality; short-term";"Artificial intelligence; Autoregressive moving average model; Costs; Forecasting; Mean square error; Time series; Electricity price forecasting; Exogenous variables; Historical information; Root mean square errors; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages; Seasonality; Short term; Statistical approach; Power markets";4;1;1;0
Oksuz I., Ugurlu U.;Neural network based model comparison for intraday electricity price forecasting;2019;Energies;7;The intraday electricity markets are continuous trade platforms for each hour of the day and have specific characteristics. These markets have shown an increasing number of transactions due to the requirement of close to delivery electricity trade. Recently, intraday electricity price market research has seen a rapid increase in a number of works for price prediction. However, most of these works focus on the features and descriptive statistics of the intraday electricity markets and overlook the comparison of different available models. In this paper, we compare a variety of methods including neural networks to predict intraday electricity market prices in Turkish intraday market. The recurrent neural networks methods outperform the classical methods. Furthermore, gated recurrent unit network architecture achieves the best results with a mean absolute error of 0.978 and a root mean square error of 1.302. Moreover, our results indicate that day-ahead market price of the corresponding hour is a key feature for intraday price forecasting and estimating spread values with day-ahead prices proves to be a more efficient method for prediction. © 2019 by the authors.;"Artificial intelligence; Electricity price forecasting; Gated recurrent unit; Long short term memory; Neural networks; Turkish intraday market";"Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Network architecture; Neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Descriptive statistics; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Gated recurrent unit; Mean absolute error; Network-based modeling; Root mean square errors; Turkishs; Power markets";5;1;2;1
Windler T., Busse J., Rieck J.;One month-ahead electricity price forecasting in the context of production planning;2019;Journal of Cleaner Production;5;One month-ahead electricity prices open up a great potential for manufacturing companies that aim at reducing energy costs. On the machine level, an energy cost-oriented scheduling can be realized through determining the least electricity cost-intensive launch times for job processing during a day. To obtain reliable price information at production planning stage in advance, well-performing forecast models are required. In this paper, we apply a Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN) approach, a TBATS approach, and a Deep Feedforward Neural Network (DFNN) approach to forecast EPEX Spot day-ahead electricity prices of the European Energy Exchange in Germany/Austria, while accounting for a forecast horizon of up to one month. Model performances are compared by means of established error measures as well as by adjusted error measures to better interpret results from a production planner's point of view. For evaluation purposes, 1357 different forecasts were computed for each of the methods, allowing valid conclusions as to their performance. The results show that all approaches lead to acceptable accuracies. However, the DFNN outperforms WNN and TBATS, providing well-fitting forecasts even 29 days ahead. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;"Artificial neural networks; Energy cost-oriented production planning; EPEX Spot market; Forecasting electricity prices";"Costs; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Neural networks; Planning; Production control; Electricity costs; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; European energy exchanges; Forecasting electricity; Manufacturing companies; Production Planning; Spot market; Power markets";5;2;1;1
Chang Z., Zhang Y., Chen W.;Electricity price prediction based on hybrid model of adam optimized LSTM neural network and wavelet transform;2019;Energy;20;To a large extent, electricity price prediction is a daunting task because it depends on factors, such as weather, fuel, load and bidding strategies etc. Those features generate a lot of fluctuations to electricity price. As a type of RNN, LSTM has a good performance on processing time series data as well as some nonlinear and complex problems. To explore more accurate electricity price forecasting approach, in this paper, a new hybrid model based on wavelet transform and Adam optimized LSTM neural network, denoted as WT-Adam-LSTM, is proposed. After the wavelet transform, nonlinear sequence of electricity price can be decomposed and processed data will have a more stable variance, and the combination of Adam, one of efficient stochastic gradient-based optimizers, and LSTM can capture appropriate behaviors precisely for electricity price. This study presented four cases to verify the performance of the hybrid model, and the dataset from New South Wales of Australia and French were adopted to illustrate the excellence of the hybrid model. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. © 2019;"Adam; Component; Electricity price prediction; Long short-term memory; Wavelet transform";"Data handling; Forecasting; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Wavelet transforms; Adam; Bidding strategy; Component; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Nonlinear sequences; Prediction accuracy; Stochastic gradient; Long short-term memory";5;1;1;1
Janke T., Steinke F.;Forecasting the price distribution of continuous intraday electricity trading;2019;Energies;9;The forecasting literature on intraday electricity markets is scarce and restricted to the analysis of volume-weighted average prices. These only admit a highly aggregated representation of the market. Instead, we propose to forecast the entire volume-weighted price distribution. We approximate this distribution in a non-parametric way using a dense grid of quantiles. We conduct a forecasting study on data from the German intraday market and aim to forecast the quantiles for the last three hours before delivery. We compare the performance of several linear regression models and an ensemble of neural networks to several well designed naive benchmarks. The forecasts only improve marginally over the naive benchmarks for the central quantiles of the distribution which is in line with the latest empirical results in the literature. However, we are able to significantly outperform all benchmarks for the tails of the price distribution. © 2019 by the authors.;"Electricity price forecasting; Intraday markets; Lasso regression; Neural networks";"Benchmarking; Commerce; Neural networks; Power markets; Regression analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity trading; Lasso regressions; Linear regression models; Non-parametric; Volume-weighted averages; Forecasting";4;1;2;2

The wind power penetration in smart grids has become highly complex in real time matching of the electricity consumption and production in the power systems due to its high variability. Thus, it is of great importance to achieve short-term prediction of electricity price accurately. In this paper, taking high wind power penetration and Nord Pool power market into concern, authors proposed a hybrid ARIMA-ANN-ANFIS model to forecast daily price for each month from January to April 2014.

Johannesen N.J., Kolhe M., Goodwin M.;Deregulated Electric Energy Price Forecasting in NordPool Market using Regression Techniques;2019;iSPEC 2019 - 2019 IEEE Sustainable Power and Energy Conference: Grid Modernization for Energy Revolution, Proceedings;;Deregulated electricity market day-ahead electrical energy price forecasting is important. It is influenced by external parameters and it is a complicated function. In this work two neighboring regions in the NordPool market are analyzed to provide day-ahead electrical price forecasting using regression techniques. The characteristics of the NordPool market trading behavior leads to unanticipated price peaks at daily, weekly and annual level. The considered two Nordic regions have different energy generation sources (e.g Norway has controllable hydro power, Denmark has non-controllable wind-power) therefore day-ahead electrical energy price forecasting in deregulated market for these two neighboring countries can impact the energy generation dynamics. Due to the dynamics of the electricity markets and region divisions this work proposes electric energy price forecasting using regression tools based in the k-Nearest Neighbor regressor, to capture the small increments in changing price behavior, and an autoregressor on top to capture the finite gradient of the occasional spikes in the price cycles. The electric energy price forecasting analysis of these two regions have shown that there is much more accurate forecasting in the Norwegian market compared to Danish market. To improve the forecasting in Danish market impact of external parameters (e.g meteorological parameters) should be considered for improving the forecasting. © 2019 IEEE.;"Autoregression; Electrical energy price forecasting; Energy Markets; Machine Learning";"Deregulation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric tools; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Regression analysis; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Autoregression; Complicated functions; Deregulated electricity market; Deregulated markets; Electrical energy; Energy markets; Meteorological parameters; Regression techniques; Power markets";4;1;1;1

Radovanovic A., Nesti T., Chen B.;A Holistic Approach to Forecasting Wholesale Energy Market Prices;2019;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;1;Electricity market price predictions enable energy market participants to shape their consumption or supply while meeting their economic and environmental objectives. By utilizing the basic properties of the supply-demand matching process performed by grid operators, known as optimal power flow (OPF), we develop a methodology to recover energy market's structure and predict the resulting nodal prices by using only publicly available data, specifically grid-wide generation type mix, system load, and historical prices. Our methodology uses the latest advancements in statistical learning to cope with high-dimensional and sparse real power grid topologies, as well as scarce, public market data, while exploiting structural characteristics of the underlying OPF mechanism. Rigorous validations using the Southwest power pool market data reveal strong correlation between the grid level mix and corresponding market prices, resulting in accurate day-ahead predictions of real-time prices. The proposed approach demonstrates a remarkable proximity to the state-of-the-art industry benchmark, while assuming a fully decentralized, market-participant perspective.

Mujeeb S., Javaid N.;ESAENARX and DE-RELM: Novel schemes for big data predictive analytics of electricity load and price;2019;Sustainable Cities and Society;12;Accurate forecasting of the electricity price and load is an essential and challenging task in smart grids. Since electricity load and price have a strong correlation, the forecast accuracy degrades when bidirectional relation of price and load is not considered. Therefore, this paper considers price and load relationship and proposes two Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs (MIMO) Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNNs) models for price and load forecasting. The first proposed model, Efficient Sparse Autoencoder Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with eXogenous inputs (ESAENARX) comprises of feature engineering and forecasting. For feature engineering, we propose ESAE and performed forecasting using existing method NARX. The second proposed model: Differential Evolution Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (DE-RELM) is based on RELM model and the meta-heuristic DE optimization technique. The descriptive and predictive analyses are performed on two well-known electricity markets’ big data, i.e., ISO NE and PJM. The proposed models outperform their sub models and a benchmark model. The refined and informative features extracted by ESAE improve the forecasting accuracy in ESANARX and optimization improves the DE-RELM's accuracy. As compared to cascade Elman network, ESAENARX has reduced MAPE upto 16% for load forecasting, 7% for price forecasting.

The proposed method uses a data filtering technique based on wavelet transform and a radial basis function neural network, which is utilized for primary prediction. The main prediction engine comprises three MLP neural networks with different learning algorithms. To get rid of local minimums and to optimize the all neural networks, the meta-heuristic Imperialist Competitive Algorithm method is used.

Moreover, the simultaneous impact of wind power generation is analyzed to predict the market-clearing price. Besides, the correlation coefficient factor is provided to consider the impact of wind power in forecasting the electricity price.

Specifically, we explored the influence of parameters such as EFORd Rates, Shadow Pricing (SP) and Transmission Loss Ratios (TLR) in the data sets with forecasting models such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and Monte-Carlo methods (e.g., embedded in RT-Sim commercial software). Specifically, the approach used in this study is different from that of traditional methods as forecasting models are trained with EFORd, SP and TLR to investigate the effect of three LMP variables: Energy cost, Loss and Congestion. The methods relied on last one week of historical data to predict the day-ahead LMP, and its results were compared against PJM's forecasting methods for a known historic date. Our goal was to study the effect of three different parts that makeup LMP and use them rather than traditional trend pricing and weather variables to predict DA LMP pricing. Our preliminary findings indicate that using EFORd, SP and TLR for PJM's peak outage season coupled with conventional data appears to improve forecast accuracy nearly 9% (MAPE value) as compared to PJM's forecasting approach. © 2019 IEEE.;"ARIMA; EFORd rate; exponential smoothing; forecasting; locational marginal pricing; Monte Carlo; shadow pricing; Transmission Loss Ratio";"Costs; Electric load loss; Monte Carlo methods; Transmissions; Wave transmission; ARIMA; Exponential smoothing; Locational marginal pricing; Shadow pricing; Transmission loss; Forecasting";4;1;1;0

The recent introduction of the Seasonal Component AutoRegressive (SCAR) modeling framework has changed this viewpoint. However, this framework is based on linear models estimated using ordinary least squares. This paper shows that considering non-linear autoregressive (NARX) neural network-type models with the same inputs as the corresponding SCAR-type models can lead to yet better performances. While individual Seasonal Component Artificial Neural Network (SCANN) models are generally worse than the corresponding SCAR-type structures, we provide empirical evidence that committee machines of SCANN networks can outperform the latter significantly. © 2017 International Institute of Forecasters;"Committee machine; Day-ahead market; Electricity spot price; Forecasting; Long-term seasonal component; NARX neural network";;4, 5;1;1;1

Moreover, forecasting systems providing prediction intervals and densities (i.e. probabilistic forecasting)are fundamental to enable enhanced bidding and planning strategies considering uncertainty explicitly. Nonetheless, the vast majority of available approaches focus on point forecast. Therefore, we propose a novel methodology for probabilistic energy price forecast based on Bayesian deep learning techniques. A specific training method has been deployed to guarantee scalability to complex network architectures. Moreover, we developed a model originally supporting heteroscedasticity, thus avoiding the common homoscedastic assumption with related preprocessing effort.

Agrawal R.K., Muchahary F., Tripathi M.M.;Ensemble of relevance vector machines and boosted trees for electricity price forecasting;2019;Applied Energy;14;Real-time prediction of electricity pricing signals is essential for scheduling load demand in price-directed grids. In a deregulated electricity market, this helps substantially increase the gains of utility companies and minimize the electricity cost to the consumers. This paper introduces a novel model for electricity locational marginal price forecasting primarily centered on relevance vector machine. Two different versions of relevance vector machine are used based on Gaussian radial basis function and polynomial kernels in the first stage. The performance of the model is boosted using Extreme Gradient Boosting to incorporate the stochastic changes in prices. In the second stage, the outputs of the three models are stacked using Elastic net regression and the final price is forecasted after bagging the computed values. The model is trained and tested on real-time data of New England electricity market. Specifically, data for two years from 2012 to 2013 have been collected with a resolution of one hour. The proposed model has proven to be highly accurate and computationally cheap at the same time. It has been compared with various models that have been previously proposed for electricity forecasting including relevance vector machine, multilayer perceptron, random forest regressor, support vector machine, recurrent neural network, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator.

Zhang F., Fleyeh H.;Short term electricity spot price forecasting using catboost and bidirectional long short term memory neural network;2019;International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM;2;Electricity price forecasting plays a crucial role in liberalized electricity markets. Generally speaking, short term electricity price forecasting is essential for electricity providers to adjust the schedule of production in order to balance consumers' demands and electricity generation. Short term forecasting results are also utilized by market players to decide the timing of purchasing or selling to gain maximized profit. Among existing forecasting approaches, neural networks are regarded as the state of art method. However, deep neural networks are not studied comprehensively in this field, thus the motivation of this study is to fill this research gap. In this paper, a novel hybrid approach is proposed for short term electricity price forecasting. To be more specific, categorical boosting (Catboost) algorithm is used for feature selection and a bidirectional long short term memory neural network (BDLSTM) serves as the main forecasting engine. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, two datasets from the Nord Pool market are employed in the experiment. Moreover, the performance of multi-layer perception (MLP) neural network, support vector regression (SVR) and ensemble tree models are evaluated and compared with the proposed model.

Even though probabilistic forecasting is becoming increasingly popular in the field of energy forecasting, this application does not seem to be covered in the literature. This paper focuses on probabilistic forecasts developed specifically for this application. A quantile regression model with natural cubic splines is proposed and backtested with historical prices from the German secondary reserve market. In addition, problems such as quantile crossing as well as advantages and disadvantages, compared to other probabilistic forecasting models, are discussed. The assessment by the continuous ranked probability score shows that the quantile regression method outperforms the benchmark ARMA model. The significance is demonstrated with the Diebold-Mariano test. © 2019 IEEE.;"Germany; Probabilistic Forecasting; Quantile Regression; Reserve Power";"Commerce; Costs; Power markets; Regression analysis; Continuous ranked probability scores; Germany; Natural cubic splines; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic forecasts; Probability densities; Quantile regression; Reserve Power; Forecasting";4;1;3;2
Poyrazoglu G.;Price Estimation by Random Walk Mean Reversion in Day-ahead Electricity Market;2019;Proceedings of 2019 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe, ISGT-Europe 2019;;The fluctuations in the Day-ahead electricity market (DAM) prices generally follow the periodic demand variance. However, the observations of historical data also reveal large jumps or spikes that might be defined as the randomness of the price formation. In this study, the Turkish DAM price is treated as a discrete signal to follow a methodology of utilizing the frequency-domain of the signal and a Fourier Transform analysis is employed for the separation of the random electricity price variations from the periodic ones. The volatility of the random electricity price variation is then used for the estimation of DAM price for a future day based on a random walk with a mean reversion method. The promising results are then compared with a multiple linear regression method from the literature to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed model for price forecasting for a Day-ahead electricity market. © 2019 IEEE.;"day-ahead market; Electricity price volatility; Energy economics; Random Walk";"Commerce; Cost estimating; Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Frequency domain analysis; Linear regression; Random processes; Smart power grids; Day ahead market; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity price variations; Electricity price volatilities; Energy economics; Fourier transform analysis; Multiple linear regression method; Random Walk; Power markets";4;1;1;1
Dash S.K., Dash P.K.;Short-term mixed electricity demand and price forecasting using adaptive autoregressive moving average and functional link neural network;2019;Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy;2;A new hybrid adaptive autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and functional link neural network (FLNN) trained by adaptive cubature Kalman filter (ACKF) is presented in this paper for forecasting day-ahead mixed short-term demand and electricity prices in smart grids. The hybrid forecasting framework is intended to capture the dynamic interaction between the electricity consumers and the forecasted prices resulting in the shift of demand curve in electricity market. The proposed model comprises a linear ARMA-FLNN obtained by using a nonlinear expansion of the weighted inputs. The nonlinear functional block helps introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher dimensional space through basis functions. To train the ARMA-FLNN, an ACKF is used to obtain faster convergence and higher forecasting accuracy. The proposed method is tested on several electricity markets, and the performance metrics such as the mean average percentage error (MAPE), and error variance are compared with other forecasting methods, indicating the improved accuracy of the approach and its suitability for a real-time forecasting. © 2019, The Author(s).;"Cubature Kalman filter; Mixed demand and price forecasting; Price spikes; Smart grids";"Commerce; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Gaussian noise (electronic); Kalman filters; Smart power grids; Adaptive autoregressive; Cubature kalman filters; Electricity consumers; Functional link neural network; Price forecasting; Price spike; Real-time forecasting; Smart grid; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1
Hannah Jessie Rani R., Aruldoss Albert Victoire T.;A hybrid Elman recurrent neural network, group search optimization, and refined VMD-based framework for multi-step ahead electricity price forecasting;2019;Soft Computing;4;This paper presents a synergy of three methods for training the Elman recurrent neural network to forecast the multi-step-ahead electricity price in an electric power system. Electricity prices are characterized as non-stationary time series data that entail vigorous learning model for predicting the future electricity price from past data. To accomplish this, an enhanced hybrid framework that integrates the refined variational mode decomposition method and the group search optimization algorithm is proposed for training the Elman recurrent neural network. The variational mode decomposition method is optimized using a complement particle swarm optimization method so as to decompose the non-stationary pricing data into optimum number of intrinsic mode functions. Subsequently, based on the power values of intrinsic mode, functions are further filtered and used as the input data to train the Elman neural network. The group search optimization algorithm is used to optimize the weights of the Elman neural network. Three real-time time series non-stationary data for multi-step ahead price prediction are adopted from Australian, British, and Indian power markets and experimented using the proposed forecasting model. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;"Elman recurrent neural network; Group search optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Spot-price forecasting; Variational mode decomposition";"Costs; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Time series; Electricity price forecasting; Elman recurrent neural network; Mode decomposition; Mode decomposition method; Non-stationary time series; Particle swarm optimization method; Search optimization; Spot price; Recurrent neural networks";5;1;1;1
Cheng H., Ding X., Zhou W., Ding R.;A hybrid electricity price forecasting model with Bayesian optimization for German energy exchange;2019;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;11;Electricity price forecasting affects the operation of the entire electricity market and it is extremely important to every market participant. In this paper, a novel hybrid method, with using empirical wavelet transform (EWT), support vector regression (SVR), Bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and Bayesian optimization (BO), is proposed to increase the accuracy of electricity price forecasting. First, EWT is used as a processing tool to decompose the original signal into specific modal components according to the characteristics of the signal itself. Then, considering the complexity of forecasting nonlinear subseries, SVR and BiLSTM are used as basic framework to forecast the nonlinear subseries. At the same time, BO is introduced to adjust parameters and optimize model performance. In last, the final prediction results are combined by the prediction results of different models. The proposed hybrid model is employed on the data gathered from the European Power Exchange Spot (EPEXSPOT). Five different case studies are adopted to verify the effectiveness of BO, EWT and hybrid model respectively. Statistical tests of experimental results compared with other situations demonstrated the proposed hybrid model can achieve a better forecasting performance. © 2019;"Bayesian optimization; Bi-directional long short-term memory; Electricity price forecasting; Empirical wavelet transform; Time series analysis";"Brain; Commerce; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Signal processing; Time series analysis; Wavelet transforms; Bayesian optimization; Bi-directional; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting performance; Market participants; Model performance; Processing tools; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets";4, 5;0;1;1

Brusaferri A., Fagiano L., Matteucci M., Vitali A.;Day ahead electricity price forecast by NARX model with LASSO based features selection;2019;IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN);;The availability of accurate day-ahead price forecasts is crucial to achieve an effective participation to electricity markets. Starting from available state of the art, we propose a forecast technique exploiting a nonlinear auto regressive model with exogenous input, including a feature selection mechanism based on the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The rationale behind such a choice is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to target potential increase of forecast accuracy by learning complex non-linear mappings. On the other hand, we want to increase the interpretability of the resulting model and minimize the effort needed to properly set up the forecaster. A framework such as the LASSO, capable to self-extract features from spot price multi-variate time series, might represent a very useful tool for industrial practitioners. Experiments have been performed on Italian market dataset, demonstrating that the proposed method can extract useful features and achieve robust performance. Moreover, we show how the proposed method can support interpretation of forecaster structure and it can reveal interesting correlations within the regression set. © 2019 IEEE.;"Features selection; LASSO; Nonlinear Auto-Regressive; Power markets; Price forecast; Time series forecast";"Commerce; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Industrial informatics; Time series; Auto-regressive; Features selection; LASSO; Price forecasts; Time series forecasts; Power markets";5;0;1;1

Xu J., Baldick R.;Day-ahead price forecasting in ERCOT market using neural network approaches;2019;e-Energy 2019 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Future Energy Systems;1;"Electricity is the ""blood"" of society. Electricity is a special commodity that is not storable, so its production and load should always be balanced to maintain a tightly regulated system frequency. Electricity production and load both depend on many factors, such as the weather, temperature, and wind. These characteristics make the dynamics of electricity price very different from that of any other commodities or financial assets. The electricity price can exhibit hourly, daily, and seasonal fluctuations, as well as abrupt unanticipated spikes. Now almost all electricity market participants use wind/load/price forecasting tools in their daily operations to optimize their operation plans, and bidding and hedging strategies, in order to maximize the profits and avoid price risks. However, the unreliable and inaccurate predictions with current forecasting tools have caused many serious problems, which can cause system instabilities and result in extreme prices even in the absence of scarcity.

Chen Y., Wang Y., Ma J., Jin Q.;BRIM: An accurate electricity spot price prediction scheme-based bidirectional recurrent neural network and integrated market;2019;Energies;2;For the benefit from accurate electricity price forecasting, not only can various electricity market stakeholders make proper decisions to gain profit in a competitive environment, but also power system stability can be improved. Nevertheless, because of the high volatility and uncertainty, it is an essential challenge to accurately forecast the electricity price. Considering that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are suitable for processing time series data, in this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based forecasting model, BRIM, which splits the state neurons of a regular RNN into two parts: the forward states (using the historical electricity price information) are designed for processing the data in positive time direction and backward states (using the future price information available at inter-connected markets) for the data in negative time direction. Moreover, due to the fact that inter-connected power exchange markets show a common trend for other neighboring markets and can provide signaling information for each other, it is sensible to incorporate and exploit the impact of the neighboring markets on forecasting accuracy of electricity price. Specifically, future electricity prices of the interconnected market are utilized both as input features for forward LSTM and backward LSTM. By testing on day-ahead electricity prices in the European Power Exchange (EPEX), the experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method BRIM in enhancing predictive accuracy in comparison with the various benchmarks, and moreover Diebold-Mariano (DM) shows that the forecast accuracy of BRIM is not equal to other forecasting models, and thus indirectly demonstrates that BRIM statistically significantly outperforms other schemes. © 2019 by the authors.;"Bidirectional recurrent neural network; Deep learning; Electricity price forecasting; Market integration";"Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Deep learning; Forecasting; Information use; Long short-term memory; System stability; Bidirectional recurrent neural networks; Competitive environment; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Market integration; Power system stability; Power-exchange market; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Power markets";5;0;1;1
Nascimento J., Pinto T., Vale Z.;Day-ahead electricity market price forecasting using artificial neural network with spearman data correlation;2019;2019 IEEE Milan PowerTech, PowerTech 2019;;Electricity markets are complex environments with very dynamic characteristics. The large-scale penetration of renewable energy sources has brought an increased uncertainty to generation, which is consequently, reflected in electricity market prices. In this way, novel advanced forecasting methods that are able to predict electricity market prices taking into account the new variables that influence prices variation are required. This paper proposes a new model for day-ahead electricity market prices forecasting based on the application of an artificial neural network. The main novelty of this paper relates to the pre-processing phase, in which the relevant data referring to the different variables that have a direct influence on market prices such as generation, temperature, consumption, among others, is analysed. The association between these variables is performed using spearman correlation, from which results the identification of which data has a larger influence on the market prices variation.

Rodriguez-Aguilar R., Marmolejo-Saucedo J.A., Retana-Blanco B.;Prices of Mexican Wholesale Electricity Market: An application of alpha-stable regression;2019;Sustainability (Switzerland);1;"This paper presents a proposal to estimate prices in the Mexican Wholesale Electric Market, which began operations in February 2016, which is why it moves from a scheme with a single bidder to a competitive market. There are particularities in the case of the Mexican market, the main one being the gradual increase in the number of competitors observed until now and, on the other hand, the geographic and technical characteristics of the electric power generation. The observed prices to date show great fluctuations in the observed data due to diverse aspects; among the stems we can mention the own seasonality of the demand of electrical energy, the availability of fuel, the problems of congestion in the electrical network, as well as other risks such as natural hazards. For the above, it is relevant in a market context to have a price estimation as accurate as possible for the decision-making of supply and demand.

Luo S., Weng Y.;A two-stage supervised learning approach for electricity price forecasting by leveraging different data sources;2019;Applied Energy;10;Over the years, the growing penetration of renewable energy into the electricity market has resulted in a significant change in the electricity market price. This change makes the existing forecasting method prone to error, decreasing the economic benefits. Hence, more precise forecasting methods need to be developed. This paper starts with a survey and benchmark of existing machine learning approaches for forecasting the real-time market (RTM) price. While these methods provide sufficient modeling capability via supervised learning, their accuracy is still limited due to the single data source, e.g., historical price information only. In this paper, a novel two-stage supervised learning approach is proposed by diversifying the data sources such as highly correlated power data. This idea is inspired by the recent load forecasting methods that have shown extremely well performances. Specifically, the proposed two-stage method, namely the rerouted method, learns two types of mapping rules. The first one is the mapping between the historical wind power and the historical price. The second is the forecasting rule for wind generation. Based on the two rules, we forecast the price via the forecasted generation and the first learned mapping between power and price. Additionally, we observed that it is not the more training data the better, leading to our validation steps to quantify the best training intervals for different datasets. We conduct comparisons of numerical results between existing methods and the proposed methods based on datasets from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). For each machine learning step, we examine different learning methods, such as polynomial regression, support vector regression, neural network, and deep neural network. The results show that the proposed method is significantly better than existing approaches when renewables are involved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;"Electricity price forecast; Machine learning methods; Renewables; Wind power generation";"Commerce; Deep neural networks; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Forecasting; Machine learning; Mapping; Power markets; Supervised learning; Tunneling (excavation); Wind power; Electric reliability council of texas; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Renewables; Supervised learning approaches; Support vector regression (SVR); Numerical methods; alternative energy; artificial neural network; electricity industry; energy planning; forecasting method; historical perspective; numerical method; price determination; supervised learning; wind power; Texas; United States";5;1;1;1

On the basis of not considering the situation of the electricity market itself and many factors affecting the electricity price, the historical load and electricity price are used as inputs to predict the electricity price from the perspective of data driven. The Lasso, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and BP Neural Network methods are used to establish a single algorithmic electricity price model respectively, and then the linear Lasso and nonlinear BP neural network are used to make combined the prediction results of four single algorithmic electricity price models. Finally, the actual electricity price and load data from Queensland are used for simulation. The simulation results show that: (i) Among the four electricity price models, BP neural network model has the highest accuracy, and the average absolute error is 6.034. The Random Forests model has the worst accuracy, with an average absolute error of 9.669.

Yousefi A., Sianaki O.A., Sharafi D.;Long-Term Electricity Price Forecast Using Machine Learning Techniques;2019;2019 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Asia, ISGT 2019;;Predicting the performance of energy commodities has long been a global priority for researchers and investors in the Energy sector. Large green field and brown field projects (often exceeding 1bn USD) are financed with locked in capital from the start, and typically take decades to return. Despite being one of the most important aspects of investment decision making, the prediction methodologies used widely today are not sophisticated enough to provide accurate insights for the investors. The new approach was proposed in this research to provide data analytics backed analysis for the performance of energy related commodities using innovative feature discovery methods and machine learning tools. In the presented research, a machine learning model was trained to predict the average monthly price of electricity in the next 5 years with focus on the California State energy market. Data points from 2001 to 2017 were collected and 78 data points are considered for analyses to select the highly-correlated features which could potentially affect the electricity price in the medium to long term. An economic case study is undertaken to understand the correlation of the features, and to avoid multicollinearity. In the next step, the selected features are applied into an S-ARIMA time series prediction algorithm. In addition, several feature-based machine learning algorithms are applied to the data and the results analysed and compared to find the effective forcasting approach. The findings demonstrated promising results for three years future price prediction horizon. Further studies are required to get more accurate electricity results beyond three years horizon. © 2019 IEEE.;"Clustering; Energy Price Prediction; Feature Correlation Analysis; Machine Learning Algorithms; Random Forests; Time Series Analysis";"Clustering algorithms; Data Analytics; Decision making; Decision trees; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Investments; Learning systems; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Smart power grids; Time series analysis; Clustering; Energy prices; Feature correlation; Investment decision making; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Prediction methodology; Random forests; Learning algorithms";4, 5;3;1;1

The Bayesian approach allows for conducting statistical inference about model parameters, latent volatility, jump times and their sizes. Moreover, the Bayesian forecasting takes into account uncertainty of parameter estimation.

Chai S., Xu Z., Jia Y.;Conditional Density Forecast of Electricity Price Based on Ensemble ELM and Logistic EMOS;2019;IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid;13;In recent years, probabilistic forecast of electricity price has become of particular interests to market participants as it can effectively model the uncertainties due to competitive market behaviors. Decision makers heavily rely on such forecast to formulate optimal strategies with minimal risk and maximum profits to deal with stochasticity in market and system operation. Different from the widely used volatility models with least square or maximum likelihood techniques in probabilistic forecast of prices, this paper proposes a reliable continuous ranked probability score-oriented predictive density construction strategy for day-ahead electricity prices. The proposed method effectively quantifies the uncertainty involved in extreme learning machine network by applying an ensemble structure and a logistic distribution-based ensemble model output statistics technique. Moreover, an efficient covariance structure directly determined by the empirical correlations of observed probabilistic forecast series is developed to capture the essential temporal interdependence thus to facilitate the operational scenarios' generation. Through validating on the real day-ahead market in Sweden, the proposed hybrid approach proves to provide superior full distributional forecasting skill over the existing approaches. © 2010-2012 IEEE.;"Density forecasts; ensemble forecasts; marginal clearing price; scenarios generation; uncertainty quantification";"Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Density forecast; Ensemble forecasts; Marginal clearing price; Scenarios generation; Uncertainty quantifications; Forecasting";4;1;1;2
Díaz G., Coto J., Gómez-Aleixandre J.;Prediction and explanation of the formation of the Spanish day-ahead electricity price through machine learning regression;2019;Applied Energy;6;Until recently, detailed information on the power system state to estimate future spot prices by regression analysis was generally restricted to qualified parties. However, to ensure transparency in operation, the Spanish Transmission System Operator has launched an informative web in which a sizable amount of real-time energy-related data can be consulted through a graphical interface. Undoubtedly, this provides the opportunity for non-qualified parties to develop applications and algorithms in which price forecast and maybe knowledge about how price is determined are required. This paper approaches the use of data extracted from that interface with two aims: the prediction of the day-ahead price in a simple way, and the exploration of the influence that the underlying energy drivers have on it. For the prediction we specified a quantile regression model based on Gradient Boosted Regression Trees. It improves the accuracy over multiple linear regression models at the cost of more complexity, and still it has simpler specification and tuning compared to other machine learning approaches. The calculated metrics show that our model produces remarkably low prediction errors when using the median as point prediction method (RMSE = 2.78 €/MWh, MAE = 1.94 €/MWh, and MAPE = 0.059). Interestingly, the quantile regression model also allows to inherently define prediction intervals, with a different interpretation of accuracy. Our results show that on average 90% of times the prediction error will not exceed 6.8 €/MWh. We also implemented a partial dependence analysis on that model.

Differently from what has been recently done in the literature on electricity price forecasting, where the attention has been mainly drawn by the prediction of spikes, the focus of this contribution is on the robust estimation of nonlinear SETARX models (Self-Exciting Threshold Auto Regressive models with eXogenous regressors). In this way, parameter estimates are not, or very lightly, influenced by the presence of extreme observations and the large majority of prices, which are not spikes, could be better forecasted. A Monte Carlo study is carried out in order to select the best weighting function for Generalized M-estimators of SETAR processes. A robust procedure to select and estimate nonlinear processes for electricity prices is introduced, including robust tests for stationarity and nonlinearity and robust information criteria. The application of the procedure to the Italian electricity market reveals the forecasting superiority of the robust GM-estimator based on the polynomial weighting function with respect to the non-robust Least Squares estimator. Finally, the introduction of generation from renewable sources in the robust estimation of SETARX processes contributes to the improvement of the forecasting ability of the model. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;"Electricity price; Nonlinear time series; Price forecasting; Robust GM-estimator; Spikes; Threshold models";"Forecasting; Power markets; Time series analysis; Electricity prices; Nonlinear time series; Price forecasting; Robust GM-estimator; Spikes; Threshold model; Cost estimating; computer simulation; electricity generation; energy market; estimation method; forecasting method; nonlinearity; numerical model; renewable resource; time series analysis; Italy";4;1;1;1
Karri C., Durgam R., Raghuram K.;Electricity price forecasting in deregulated power markets using wavelet-ANFIS-KHA;2019;2018 International Conference on Computing, Power and Communication Technologies, GUCON 2018;1;This article presents a hybrid method by combining Wavelet-ANFIS-KHA for forecasting the prices of electricity in the power markets under deregulation. Electricity prices in the power market exhibits highly non-linear and non-stationary that makes forecasting the electricity prices very difficult. Three major stages are involved in the proposed algorithms to forecast the electricity prices. In stage I, discrete wavelet transform (db4, level 3) is applied for decomposing the prices of electricity data to a set of constitutive for reducing the variation in the prices data. In stage II, ANFIS is used to forecast the electricity prices. KHA has been adopted in updating the various weights in the ANFIS to get better accuracy. The code of the hybrid algorithm has been developed in MATLAB. The proposed Wavelet-KHA-ANFIS has been tested on the real time system. The simulation results in terms of MAPE, MRSE and APE have been presented. It has been found that the proposed algorithm provides best accuracy in comparison with the existing algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.;"Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System; Electricity price forecasting; Krill herd algorithm; Wavelet";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Discrete wavelet transforms; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Inference engines; Interactive computer systems; MATLAB; Real time systems; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Deregulated power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid method; Nonstationary; Wavelet; Power markets";5;1;1;1
De Marcos R.A., Bello A., Reneses J.;Short-term electricity price forecasting with a composite fundamental-econometric hybrid methodology;2019;Energies;;Various power exchanges are nowadays being affected by a plethora of factors that, as a whole, cause considerable instabilities in the system. As a result, traders and practitioners must constantly adapt their strategies and look for support for their decision-making when operating in the market. In many cases, this calls for suitable electricity price forecasting models that can account for relevant aspects for electricity price forecasting. Consequently, fundamental-econometric hybrid approaches have been developed by many authors in the literature, although these have rarely been applied in short-term contexts, where other considerations and issues must be addressed. Therefore, this work aims to develop a robust hybrid methodology that is capable of making the most of the advantages fundamental and the hybrid model in a synergistic manner, while also providing insight as to how well these models perform across the year. Several methods have been utilised in this work in order to modify the hybridisation approach and the input datasets for enhanced predictive accuracy. The performance of this proposal has been analysed in the real case study of the Iberian power exchange and has outperformed other well-recognised and traditional methods. © 2019 by the authors.;"Forecast combination; Fundamental-econometric models; Hybrid models; Power exchanges; Short-term electricity price forecasting";"Commerce; Decision making; Forecasting; Econometric model; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combinations; Hybrid model; Power exchange; Power markets";2;1;1;1
Chang Z., Zhang Y., Chen W.;Effective Adam-Optimized LSTM Neural Network for Electricity Price Forecasting;2019;Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences, ICSESS;8;Electrical energy, considered to be a clean energy source, has made a significant contribution to humanity. To make better use of electric energy, great efforts have been paid by electricity market researchers and practitioners on electricity price forecasting. Long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, performs well in many areas, such as language modeling and speech recognition. However, the performance of applying the LSTM model to process time series and nonlinear regression problems is not so satisfactory. Stochastic gradient-based optimization has core practical importance in many scientific and engineering fields. Adam, a method for efficient stochastic optimization, has combined the advantages of two popular optimization methods: AdaGrad and RMSProp, it makes LSTM model perform even better. In this study, two examples were listed to verify the performance of the Adam-optimized LSTM neural network, and the dataset from New South Wales of Australia were adopted to illustrate the excellence of model. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.;"Adam; component; Electricity price; Long short-term memory";"Brain; Forecasting; Modeling languages; Optimization; Power markets; Software engineering; Speech recognition; Stochastic models; Adam; Clean energy sources; component; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Nonlinear regression problems; Practical importance; Stochastic optimizations; Long short-term memory";5;1;1;1
Naz A., Javed M.U., Javaid N., Saba T., Alhussein M., Aurangzeb K.;Short-term electric load and price forecasting using enhanced extreme learning machine optimization in smart grids;2019;Energies;15;A Smart Grid (SG) is a modernized grid to provide efficient, reliable and economic energy to the consumers. Energy is the most important resource in the world. An efficient energy distribution is required as smart devices are increasing dramatically. The forecasting of electricity consumption is supposed to be a major constituent to enhance the performance of SG. Various learning algorithms have been proposed to solve the forecasting problem. The sole purpose of this work is to predict the price and load efficiently. The first technique is Enhanced Logistic Regression (ELR) and the second technique is Enhanced Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (ERELM). ELR is an enhanced form of Logistic Regression (LR), whereas, ERELM optimizes weights and biases using a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Relief-F and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) are used for feature selection and extraction. On the basis of selected features, classification is performed using ELR. Cross validation is done for ERELM using Monte Carlo and K-Fold methods. The simulations are performed on two different datasets. The first dataset, i.e., UMass Electric Dataset is multi-variate while the second dataset, i.e., UCI Dataset is uni-variate. The first proposed model performed better with UMass Electric Dataset than UCI Dataset and the accuracy of second model is better with UCI than UMass. The prediction accuracy is analyzed on the basis of four different performance metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed techniques are then compared with four benchmark schemes. The comparison is done to verify the adaptivity of the proposed techniques. The simulation results show that the proposed techniques outperformed benchmark schemes. The proposed techniques efficiently increased the prediction accuracy of load and price. However, the computational time is increased in both scenarios. ELR achieved almost 5% better results than Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and almost 3% than LR. While, ERELM achieved almost 6% better results than ELM and almost 5% than RELM. However, the computational time is almost 20% increased with ELR and 50% with ERELM. Scalability is also addressed for the proposed techniques using half-yearly and yearly datasets. Simulation results show that ELR gives 5% better results while, ERELM gives 6% better results when used for yearly dataset. © 2019 by the authors.;"CNN; ELR; ERELM; Forecasting; Load; LR; Price; RELM; Smart grid";"Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Errors; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Lawrencium; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Loading; Mean square error; Monte Carlo methods; Neural networks; Power markets; Regression analysis; Classification and regression tree; ERELM; Feature selection and extractions; Mean absolute percentage error; Price; Recursive feature elimination; RELM; Smart grid; Smart power grids";5;1;1;1
Jufri F.H., Oh S., Jung J.;Day-Ahead System Marginal Price Forecasting Using Artificial Neural Network and Similar-Days Information;2019;Journal of Electrical Engineering and Technology;2;Day-ahead system marginal price (SMP) forecasting constitutes essential information in the competitive energy market. Hence, this paper presents the development of a day-ahead SMP forecasting model via implementing an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The accuracy of the ANN-based model is improved by including long-term historical data in addition to short-term historical data and by applying the k-fold cross-validation optimization algorithm. The selection of the short-term type input variable applies the Pearson correlation coefficient. Whereas the long-term type input variable is selected by applying the discrete Fréchet distance in conjunction with the information related to the season and type of the day to find the Similar-Days Index. In order to verify the model, the forecasted load and actual SMP for 15 years of historical data are used. The results indicate that the proposed model can forecast SMP with higher accuracy than the conventional forecasting model. © 2019, The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.;"Artificial neural network (ANN); Day-ahead SMP forecasting; Similar days; SMP forecasting; System marginal price (SMP)";"Correlation methods; Forecasting; Neural networks; Day-ahead; Forecasting modeling; Historical data; Input variables; K fold cross validations; Pearson correlation coefficients; Similar day; System marginal price; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1
Ghayekhloo M., Azimi R., Ghofrani M., Menhaj M.B., Shekari E.;A combination approach based on a novel data clustering method and Bayesian recurrent neural network for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets;2019;Electric Power Systems Research;6;Electricity price forecasting is an ancillary service that plays a key role for market participants in a deregulated structure. Compared to other commodities, electricity price exhibits higher levels of volatility and uncertainty. This imposes more restrictions on the accuracy of the forecast and leads to significant errors. This paper proposes a hybrid electricity price-forecasting framework with a novel time series data mining method to enhance the feature selection. The proposed method includes clustering, preprocessing and training stages. The proposed data clustering method uses both an enhanced game theoretic approach and neural gas in combination with competitive Hebbian learning to provide a better vector quantization. Six strategies are proposed to enable the non-winning neurons to participate in the learning phase and resolve the shortcomings of the original self-organizing map, where the dead neurons are far from the input patterns without having any chance to compete with the winning neurons. The price-load input data are clustered into a proper number of subsets using the proposed data mining method. A novel cluster selection method based on the persistence approach is applied to select the most appropriate cluster as the input to the BRNN. The selected data set is filtered by the harmonic analysis time series, and is time-series processed to provide the proper inputs for training neural networks. Bayesian approach is used to train a recurrent neural network, and forecast the electricity price. The performance of the proposed clustering algorithm is evaluated using different electricity market data. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed clustering algorithm as compared to K-means, neural gas and self-organizing map clustering methods Our proposed clustering provides 16.7%, 28.6%, and 13% more accurate results than K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map for the NYISO. CAPITL data. For the NYISO. CENTRL data, the developed clustering outperforms the K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map by 21.4%, 21.4%, and 8.3%, respectively. The clustering accuracy of the proposed method for NYISO. DUNWOD data is 5.5%, 19%, and 5.5% better than that of the K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map methods Lastly, for the NYISO. GENESE data, the mean square error value for the proposed clustering is 13.7%, 14.9%, and 12.5% less than that of the K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map, respectively. The developed forecasting method is also compared with the existing state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms. The comparison results show an improvement in the forecast accuracy of the developed method over other forecasting approaches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Bayesian approach; Data mining; Forecasting; Fourier analysis; Recurrent neural network; Time series analysis";"Bayesian networks; Cluster analysis; Commerce; Conformal mapping; Data mining; Deregulation; Financial markets; Forecasting; Fourier analysis; Fourier series; Game theory; Gases; Harmonic analysis; Mean square error; Neurons; Power markets; Recurrent neural networks; Self organizing maps; Time series analysis; Bayesian approaches; Clustering accuracy; Combination approaches; Data clustering methods; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting algorithm; Forecasting methods; Time series data mining; Clustering algorithms";5;1;1;1
Maciejowska K., Nitka W., Weron T.;Day-ahead vs. Intraday—Forecasting the price spread to maximize economic benefits;2019;Energies;17;"Recently, a dynamic development of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) has been observed. In order to allow for the adoption of trading contracts for unplanned events and changing weather conditions, the day-ahead markets have been complemented by intraday markets; in some countries, such as Poland, balancing markets are used for this purpose. This research focuses on a small RES generator, which has no market power and sells electricity through a larger trading company. The generator needs to decide, in advance, how much electricity is sold in the day-ahead market. The optimal decision of the generator on where to sell the production depends on the relation between prices in different markets. Unfortunately, when making the decision, the generator is not sure which market will offer a higher price. This article investigates the possible gains from utilizing forecasts of the price spread between the intraday/balancing and day-ahead markets in the decision process. It shows that the sign of the price spread can be successfully predicted with econometric models, such as ARX and probit. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the statistical measures of forecast accuracy, such as the percentage of correct sign classifications, do not necessarily coincide with economic benefits. © 2019 by the authors.";"ARX model; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Forecasting; Price spread; Probit model";"Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Renewable energy resources; ARX model; Dynamic development; Electricity prices; Forecast accuracy; Price spread; Probit models; Renewable energy source; Statistical measures; Power markets";4;1;1, 2;1
Afanasyev D.O., Fedorova E.A.;On the impact of outlier filtering on the electricity price forecasting accuracy;2019;Applied Energy;5;Increasing the accuracy of short-term electricity price forecasting allows day-ahead power market participants to obtain a positive economic effect by bidding close to the equilibrium price. However the electricity price time-series is generally infested with extreme values due to high price volatility. This paper discusses the impact of outlier filtering on forecasting accuracy based on a recently introduced seasonal component autoregressive model. We consider such methods of outlier detection (with a priori defined cut-off parameter) as threshold, standard deviation, percentage, recursive, and moving filter on prices. It is shown that such data pre-processing often leads to the forecasting accuracy gain while the error decrease (relative to the approach without filtering) in a number of cases may reach 1.8–1.9% of the average weekly price (in absolute values). For an a priori defined cut-off parameter, the simple threshold and standard deviation filter on prices outperform other considered methods, and yield to the accuracy gain in 63% and 67% of cases, correspondingly. At the same time, in case of the out-of-sample filter parameter grid-optimization all of the methods demonstrate comparable prediction power (equal to the marginal performance). But, practically speaking, such optimization is time-consuming and cannot be carried out on unavailable future data. As an competitive alternative, we propose a combined filter on prices based on a committee machine which uses the results of individual non-optimized algorithms and is not time-consuming, but gives accuracy comparable to the best one obtained for each of the studied electricity markets and leads to forecast gain in 63% of the considered cases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;"Committee machine; Electricity price forecasting; Long-term trend-seasonal component; Model confidence set; Outlier filtering";"Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Forecasting; Statistics; Auto regressive models; Committee machines; Day-ahead power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Long-term trend; Optimized algorithms; Standard deviation; Power markets; accuracy assessment; algorithm; economic conditions; electricity; energy market; optimization; price determination";4, 5;1;1;1
Mujeeb S., Javaid N., Ilahi M., Wadud Z., Ishmanov F., Afzal M.K.;Deep long short-term memory: A new price and load forecasting scheme for big data in smart cities;2019;Sustainability (Switzerland);23;This paper focuses on analytics of an extremely large dataset of smart grid electricity price and load, which is difficult to process with conventional computational models. These data are known as energy big data. The analysis of big data divulges the deeper insights that help experts in the improvement of smart grid's (SG) operations. Processing and extracting of meaningful information from data is a challenging task. Electricity load and price are the most influential factors in the electricity market. For improving reliability, control and management of electricity market operations, an exact estimate of the day ahead load is a substantial requirement. Energy market trade is based on price. Accurate price forecast enables energy market participants to make effective and most profitable bidding strategies. This paper proposes a deep learning-based model for the forecast of price and demand for big data using Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM). Due to the adaptive and automatic feature learning mechanism of Deep Neural Network (DNN), the processing of big data is easier with LSTM as compared to the purely data-driven methods. The proposed model was evaluated using well-known real electricity markets' data. In this study, day and week ahead forecasting experiments were conducted for all months. Forecast performance was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). The proposed Deep LSTM (DLSTM) method was compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) time series forecasting methods, i.e., Nonlinear Autoregressive network with Exogenous variables (NARX) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). DLSTM outperformed the compared forecasting methods in terms of accuracy. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method for electricity price and load forecasting. © 2019 by the authors.;"Big data; Electricity load; Long Short-Term Memory LSTM; Price forecasting; Smart grid";"artificial neural network; data set; electricity; energy market; forecasting method; price determination; profitability; smart city";5;1;1;1
Cerjan M., Petričić A., Delimar M.;HIRA model for short-term electricity price forecasting;2019;Energies;3;In competitive power markets, electric utilities, power producers, and traders are exposed to increased risks caused by electricity price volatility. The growing reliance on renewable sources and their dependence on weather, nuclear uncertainty, market coupling, and global financial instability are contributing to the importance of accurate electricity price forecasting. Since power markets are not all equally developed, different price forecasting methods have been introduced for individual markets. The aim of this research is to introduce a short-term electricity price forecasting method that addresses the problems of price volatility, a varying number of input parameters, varying data availability, and a large number of parameters and input data. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used on any market as it targets the characteristics and specifics of each market. The proposed Hybrid Iterative Reactive Adaptive (HIRA) method consists of two phases. In analysis phase, fundamental parameters which affect the electricity price are identified depending on market development. Obtained parameters are used as data inputs for price forecasting using a hybrid method. The HIRA model combines a statistical approach for large data set analysis and a similar day method with neural network tools. Similar days are examined using a statistical method which combines correlation significance, price volatility, and forecasting accuracy of the historical data. Data are collected based on their availability and electricity prices are forecasted in several iterations. All relevant data for price forecasting are collected, categorized, and arranged using simple indicators which makes the HIRA model adaptive and reactive to new market circumstances. The proposed model is validated using the Hungarian Power Exchange (HUPX) electricity price data records. The results show that with HIRA model forecasting, the error is stable and does not depend on price volatility. The HIRA method has proven to be applicable for forecasting electricity prices in real-time market conditions and enables effective hedging of price risk in the production or market portfolio. © 2019 by the authors.;"Data mining; Dynamic hybrid model; Electricity market; Electricity price; Neural network; Short-term electricity price forecast; Spot market";"Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Electric utilities; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Competitive power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price volatilities; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Hybrid model; Spot market; Power markets";4,5;1;1;1

Consequentially, challenges for profitability as well as correct management of the electricity sector have increased its complexity. The use of forecasting tools that allow a real and robust approach makes it possible to improve system operation and thus minimizing costs associated with the activities of the electric sector. Hence, the forecasting approaches have an essential role in all stages of the electricity markets. In this paper, a hybrid probabilistic forecasting model (HPFM) was developed for short-term electricity market prices (EMP), combining Wavelet Transform (WT), hybrid particle swarm optimization (DEEPSO), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), together with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The proposed HPFM was tested and validated with real data from the Spanish and Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) markets, considering the next week ahead.

Yang W., Wang J., Niu T., Du P.;A hybrid forecasting system based on a dual decomposition strategy and multi-objective optimization for electricity price forecasting;2019;Applied Energy;48;Electricity price forecasting plays a crucial role in balancing electricity generation and consumption, which is of great political and economic significance for all of society but is still a challenging task. However, in previous studies, most researchers have focused on improving either forecasting accuracy or stability while ignoring the significance of performing these tasks simultaneously. More importantly, few researchers have deeply studied the data preprocessing strategy, only focusing on the application of individual decomposition approaches. Therefore, a novel hybrid forecasting system based on a dual decomposition strategy and multi-objective optimization is developed for electricity price forecasting that includes four modules: a data preprocessing module, optimization module, forecasting module and evaluation module. In this system, an effective multi-objective optimization algorithm is employed to guarantee simultaneous improvements in accuracy and stability. In addition, an improved data preprocessing approach named the dual decomposition strategy is developed, which successfully overcomes the potential drawback of the individual decomposition approach and further improves the effectiveness of the developed forecasting system. Moreover, the evaluation module is incorporated to verify the superiority of the developed forecasting system. Case studies utilizing half-hourly electricity price data collected from New South Wales, Australia are employed as examples. The results prove the superiority of the multi-objective optimization algorithm and the developed dual decomposition strategy and reveal that the developed forecasting system outperforms all of the considered comparison models, which shows its better ability to forecast future electricity prices with better accuracy and stability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;"Dual decomposition strategy; Electricity price forecasting system; Forecasting accuracy and stability; Multi-objective optimization algorithm";"Forecasting; Power markets; System stability; Decomposition approach; Dual decomposition; Electricity generation; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Multi-objective optimization algorithms; New South Wales , Australia; Optimization module; Multiobjective optimization; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data processing; decomposition analysis; electricity; electricity generation; forecasting method; optimization; price dynamics; Australia; New South Wales";4, 5;1;1;2
de Marcos R.A., Bello A., Reneses J.;Electricity price forecasting in the short term hybridising fundamental and econometric modelling;2019;Electric Power Systems Research;8;Traders and practitioners in diverse power exchanges are nowadays being most exposed to uncertainty than ever. The combination of several factors such as renewable generation and regulatory changes calls for suitable electricity price forecasting models that can deal with complex and unusual market conditions. Several authors have proposed combining fundamental approaches with econometric models in order to cover all relevant aspects for electricity price forecasting. This combination has shown positive results for medium-term horizons. However, this approach has rarely been carried out for short-term applications. Moreover, several day-to-day applications in electricity markets require fast responsiveness and accurate forecasts. All of these facts encourage this work's short-term hybrid electricity price forecasting model, which combines a cost-production optimisation (fundamental) model with an artificial neural network (econometric) model. In order to validate the advantages and contributions of the proposed model, it has been applied to a real-size power exchange with complex price dynamics, such as the Iberian electricity market. Moreover, its forecasting performance has been compared with those of the two individual components of the hybrid model as well as other well-recognised methods. The results of this comparison prove that the proposed forecasting model outperforms the benchmark models, especially in uncommon market circumstances. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Econometric models; Electricity markets; Fundamental models; Hybrid models; Short-term forecasting";"Commerce; Complex networks; Forecasting; Neural networks; Econometric model; Econometric modelling; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting performance; Fundamental models; Hybrid model; Iberian electricity market; Short-term forecasting; Power markets";2, 5;1;1;2
Zhang J.-L., Zhang Y.-J., Li D.-Z., Tan Z.-F., Ji J.-F.;Forecasting day-ahead electricity prices using a new integrated model;2019;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;17;Electricity price forecasting proves useful for power producers and consumers to make proper decisions in a market-oriented environment. However, due to the complex drivers and sharp fluctuation of electricity prices, accurate electricity price forecasting turns to be very difficult. To better capture the characteristics of day-ahead electricity prices, a new integrated model based on the improved empirical mode decomposition (IEMD), autoregressive moving average with exogenous terms (ARMAX), exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (EGARCH) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed in this paper. Then it is validated by using the data from Spanish and Australian electricity markets.

Wang F., Li K., Zhou L., Ren H., Contreras J., Shafie-khah M., Catalão J.P.S.;Daily pattern prediction based classification modeling approach for day-ahead electricity price forecasting;2019;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;48;Day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) plays a very important role in the decision-making optimization of electricity market participants, the dispatch control of independent system operators (ISOs) and the strategy formulation of energy trading. Unified modeling that only fits a single mapping relation between the historical data and future data usually produces larger errors because the different fluctuation patterns in electricity price data show different mapping relations. A daily pattern prediction (DPP) based classification modeling approach for DAEPF is proposed to solve this problem. The basic idea is that first recognize the price pattern of the next day from the “rough” day-ahead forecasting results provided by conventional forecasting methods and then perform classification modeling to further improve the forecasting accuracy through building a specific forecasting model for each pattern. The proposed approach consists of four steps. First, K-means is utilized to group all the historical daily electricity price curves into several clusters in order to assign each daily curve a pattern label for the training of the following daily pattern recognition (DPR) model and classification modeling. Second, a DPP model is proposed to recognize the price pattern of the next day from the forecasting results provided by multiple conventional forecasting methods. A weighted voting mechanism (WVM) method is proposed in this step to combine multiple day-ahead pattern predictions to obtain a more accurate DPP result. Third, the classification forecasting model of each different daily pattern can be established according to the clustering results in step 1. Fourth, the credibility of DPP result is checked to eventually determine whether the proposed classification DAEPF modeling approach can be adopted or not. A case study using the real electricity price data from the PJM market indicates that the proposed approach presents a better performance than unified modeling for a certain daily pattern whose DPP results show high reliability and accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;"Classification modeling; Daily pattern prediction; Day-ahead forecasting; Electricity price; Weighted voting mechanism";"Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Decision making; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Mapping; Pattern recognition; Classification models; Day-ahead; Decision-making optimization; Different mapping relation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Independent system operators; Weighted voting; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1
McHugh C., Coleman S., Kerr D., McGlynn D.;A Linear Polynomial NARMAX Model with Multiple Factors to Forecast Day-Ahead Electricity Prices;2019;Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2018;1;Forecasting algorithms are a valuable mechanism to aid in the prediction of future prices. Although various black-box modelling techniques have been applied to variations of this problem, we focus on the use of transparent models to enable understanding and interpretation of the developed model. We utilize a Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous input(NARMAX) for electricity price forecasting using multiple input factors. Energy data from a 14-week period in 2017 were analyzed to determine whether a NARMAX model could accurately predict day-ahead electricity prices and to check which input factors in the model were most significant. The model considered the closely correlated lags and included 13 input factors. There were two models developed in order to determine which variables played an important role in predicting future prices. Experimental results indicate that previous price, demand, gas, coal, and nuclear are the most significant factors that influence electricity prices. Gas was the highest weighted factor for both developed models. Previous price yielded the biggest Error Reduction Ratio(ERR), but when not included in the model, demand generated the biggest ERR value. To summarize a NARMAX model with an input regression lag of one and previous price included generates the best day-ahead forecast of electricity prices. © 2018 IEEE.;"Electricity price forecasting; Energy market; Multiple factors; NARMAX";"Artificial intelligence; Composite structures; Costs; Forecasting; Black box modelling; Electricity price forecasting; Energy markets; Error reduction ratios; Forecasting algorithm; Multiple factors; NARMAX; Nonlinear autoregressive moving average models; Power markets";4;1;1;1

Therefore, we investigate the use of computational intelligence-based approaches for electricity price forecasting. This paper compares two models for day-ahead electricity price forecasting, an AdaBoosted ensemble of the Extra-Trees algorithm and a Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN). In this work both forecasting models were applied to the national electricity market of Great Britain, the British Energy and Electricity Trading Arrangements (BETTA).

The non-stationary time series data like electricity price, needs robust learning model for prediction of future market price to effective operation of the market based power system. In this research, an adaptive regularized extreme learning machine (ARELM) is proposed with adaptive weight updation in the hidden layers based on both structural risk minimization and empirical risk minimization. The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is applied for optimizing the initial weights and thresholds between input layer and hidden layer of ARELM model. To enhance the overall prediction accuracy of ARELM, a new improved Variational Mode Decomposition (IVMD) is employed to decompose the pricing data into several intermediate frequency modes thereby eradicate stochastic components. Two real-time electricity price series of Australia and India are adopted for multi-step ahead prediction and the results are compared with other learning models available in the literature. © 2018 IEEE.;"-Adaptive-Regularized-extreme-learning-machine-; -price-forecasting; Variational-mode-decomposition";"Ant colony optimization; Commerce; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme learning machine; Intermediate frequency modes; Mode decomposition; Multi-step-ahead predictions; Price forecasting; Structural risk minimization; Machine learning";5;1;1;1
Meier J.-H., Schneider S., Le C.;Short-term electricity price forecasting using generalized additive models;2019;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;;If one examines the spot price series of electrical power over the course of time, it is striking that the electricity price across the day takes a course that is determined by power consumption following a day and night rhythm. The daily course changes in its height and temporal extent in both, the course of the week, as well as with the course of the year. This study deals methodologically with this intra-day and seasonal behaviour. We contribute the usage of Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and apply these models with European data. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

Serafin T., Uniejewski B., Weron R.;Averaging predictive distributions across calibration windows for day-ahead electricity price forecasting;2019;Energies;5;The recent developments in combining point forecasts of day-ahead electricity prices across calibration windows have provided an extremely simple, yet a very efficient tool for improving predictive accuracy. Here, we consider two novel extensions of this concept to probabilistic forecasting: one based on Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) applied to a set of point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows, the other on a technique dubbed Quantile Regression Machine (QRM), which first averages these point predictions, then applies quantile regression to the combined forecast. Once computed, we combine the probabilistic forecasts across calibration windows by averaging probabilities of the corresponding predictive distributions. Our results show that QRM is not only computationally more efficient, but also yields significantly more accurate distributional predictions, as measured by the aggregate pinball score and the test of conditional predictive ability. Moreover, combining probabilistic forecasts brings further significant accuracy gains. c 2019 by the authors.;"Autoregression; Average probability forecast; Calibration window; Combining forecasts; Conditional predictive ability; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive distribution";"Calibration; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Regression analysis; Autoregression; Combining forecasts; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive abilities; Predictive distributions; Probability forecasts; Power markets";4;2;1;2
Shayeghi H., Ghasemi A., Shayanfar H.A.;Effect of demand-side management in electricity price/load forecasting in smart grids;2019;Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, ICAI 2015 - WORLDCOMP 2015;;Electricity price and load forecasting are two important problems for market participants and independent system operators (ISO) in smart grid environments. Most existing papers predict price and load separately, while, the aggregate reaction of consumers can potentially shift the demand curve in the market, resulting in prices that may differ from the initial forecasts. In this regards, demand-side management (DSM) constructs the customers responsible for improving the efficiency, reliability and sustainability of the power system. In this paper, we proposed a new multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system which can consider the interaction between load and price. Therefore, proposed Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) to model the nonlinear pattern in price and load. Also, used discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to make valuable subsets. Moreover, proposed feature selection to select best input candidates. Finally, the MIMO-based LSSVM parameters are optimized by artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. Simulations carried out NEPOOL region (courtesy ISO New England) electricity market data, and showing that the proposed algorithm has good potential for simultaneous forecasting of electricity price and load in smart grids. © 2019 ICAI 2015 - WORLDCOMP 2015.

Karabiber O.A., Xydis G.;Electricity price forecasting in the Danish day-ahead market using the TBATS, ANN and ARIMA methods;2019;Energies;11;In this paper day-ahead electricity price forecasting for the Denmark-West region is realized with a 24 h forecasting range. The forecasting is done for 212 days from the beginning of 2017 and past data from 2016 is used. For forecasting, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Trigonometric Seasonal Box-Cox Transformation with ARMA residuals Trend and Seasonal Components (TBATS) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods are used and seasonal naïve forecast is utilized as a benchmark. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are used as accuracy criterions. ARIMA and ANN are utilized with external variables and variable analysis is realized in order to improve forecasting results. As a result of variable analysis, it was observed that excluding temperature from external variables helped improve forecasting results. In terms of mean error ARIMA yielded the best results while ANN had the lowest minimum error and standard deviation. TBATS performed better than ANN in terms of mean error. To further improve forecasting accuracy, the three forecasts were combined using simple averaging and ANN methods and they were both found to be beneficial, with simple averaging having better accuracy. Overall, this paper demonstrates a solid forecasting methodology, while showing actual forecasting results and improvements for different forecasting methods. © 2019 by the authors.;"ARIMA; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combination; Neural network";"Commerce; Errors; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; ARIMA; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Box Cox transformation; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combinations; Forecasting accuracy; Root mean squared errors; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1
Xiong H., Mamon R.;A higher-order Markov chain-modulated model for electricity spot-price dynamics;2019;Applied Energy;6;Over the last three decades, the electricity sector worldwide underwent massive deregulation. Power market participants have encountered a growing number of challenges due to competition and other pertinent factors. For most markets at present, electricity is a non-storable commodity and its price is extremely sensitive to changes in supply and demand. The evolution of electricity prices exhibits pronounced mean reversion and cyclical patterns, possesses extreme volatility and relatively frequently occurring spikes, and manifests presence of memory property. These observed features necessitate the development of models aimed to simultaneously capture such price characteristics for forecasting, risk management, and valuation of electricity-driven derivatives. Majority of current research studies examining electricity spot prices are based on one-state models. Such models though may not accurately capture the stylised behaviours of price evolution, especially during periods of sudden spikes driven by the abrupt changes of market sentiments. This paper tackles the modelling and estimation problems under a new paradigm that integrates the deterministic calendar seasons and stochastic factors governing electricity prices with a regime-switching feature. The de-seasonalised component of our proposed model has both the jump and mean-reverting properties to account for spikes and periodic cycles alternating between lower price returns and compensating periods of higher price returns. The parameters of the de-seasonalised model components are also modulated by a higher-order hidden Markov chain (HOHMC) in discrete time. This provides a mechanism to extract latent information from historical data. The HOHMC's state is interpreted as the “state of the world” resulting from the interaction of various forces impacting the electricity market. Filters are developed to generate optimal estimates of HOHMC-relevant quantities using the observation process, and these provide online estimates of model parameters. Empirical demonstrations using the daily electricity spot prices, compiled by the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO), show that our HOHMM approach has considerable merits in terms of price data fitting and forecasting metrics. Our proposed framework driven by a hidden Markov chain with a state memory-capturing mechanism provides a powerful alternative to support the pricing of contracts in the electricity markets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;"Change of reference probability measure; Commodity-derivatives valuation; Energy-price modelling; Finance; Poisson process; Statistical estimation";"Chains; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Finance; Markov processes; Risk management; Signal theory; Stochastic systems; Electricity spot price; Energy prices; Hidden Markov chains; Higher-order Markov chains; Market participants; Poisson process; Reference probability; Statistical estimation; Power markets; demand analysis; electricity; energy market; estimation method; financial system; Markov chain; numerical model; Poisson ratio; price dynamics; probability; statistical analysis; stochasticity; Alberta; Canada";3, 4;1;1;1

Gao W., Darvishan A., Toghani M., Mohammadi M., Abedinia O., Ghadimi N.;Different states of multi-block based forecast engine for price and load prediction;2019;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;69;This work proposes different prediction models based on multi-block forecast engine for load and price forecast in electricity market. Due to high correlation of load and price signals, the density of this reaction can affect the demand curve and shift it in market. Furthermore, to improve the operation and planning improvement in the power system, an accurate prediction model can play an important role. So, in this paper, a complex prediction approach is presented based on feature selection, and multi-stage forecast engine. The forecast engine is comprised of multi-block neural network (NN) and optimized by an intelligent algorithm to increase the training mechanism and forecasting abilities. Moreover, different models of multi-block forecast engine are presented in this paper to choose the effective model.

Osório G.J., Lotfi M., Shafie-khah M., Campos V.M.A., Catalão J.P.S.;Hybrid forecasting model for short-term electricity market prices with renewable integration;2018;Sustainability (Switzerland);6;In recent years, there have been notable commitments and obligations by the electricity sector for more sustainable generation and delivery processes to reduce the environmental footprint. However, there is still a long way to go to achieve necessary sustainability goals while ensuring standards of robustness and the quality of power grids. One of the main challenges hindering this progress are uncertainties and stochasticity associated with the electricity sector and especially renewable generation. In this paradigm shift, forecasting tools are indispensable, and their utilization can significantly improve system operation and minimize costs associated with all related activities. Thus, forecasting tools have an essential key role in all decision-making stages. In this work, a hybrid probabilistic forecasting model (HPFM) was developed for short-term electricity market prices (EMP) combining wavelet transforms (WT), hybrid particle swarm optimization (DEEPSO), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The proposed hybrid probabilistic forecasting model (HPFM) was tested and validated with real data from the Spanish and Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) markets.

Hamilton G., Abeygunawardana A., Jovanovic D.P., Ledwich G.F.;Hybrid Model for Very Short-Term Electricity Price Forecasting;2018;IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting;;It is expected that more and more grid connected renewable plants, coupled with energy storage, will be added to the Australian grid to meet the grid integration challenges of renewables.

Li Y., Liang R., Li Z., Gao J., Wang Y., Wu T.;Research on electricity price forecasting method based on genetic algorithm and neural network in power market;2018;2nd IEEE Conference on Energy Internet and Energy System Integration, EI2 2018 - Proceedings;2;With the development of electric power industry marketization, the importance of electricity price forecasting has been gradually highlighted. Because of the randomness of electricity price and the good generalization ability of neural network to deal with various non-linear problems, the Back Propagation (BP) neural network algorithm is widely used to predict electricity price. However, BP neural network has some disadvantages such as slow convergence rate and easy to fall into local optimum, so this paper improves the BP neural network prediction algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA). The traditional BP neural network is easy to get the error signal into local minima, and the genetic algorithm can solve the problem by optimizing the weights and thresholds of BP neural network. This paper chooses the electricity price of electricity market in Australia as an example, uses the genetic algorithm and BP neural network model to solve the actual operation, realizes the cause of the final error, and verifies the superiority of BP neural network based on genetic algorithm compared with the traditional BP neural network. © 2018 IEEE.;"BP Networks; Electricity Market; Electricity Price Forecasting; Error Analysis; Genetic Algorithms";"Backpropagation algorithms; Commerce; Electric industry; Error analysis; Errors; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks; Back propagation neural networks; BP networks; BP neural network model; BP neural networks; Electric power industries; Electricity price forecasting; Generalization ability; Nonlinear problems; Power markets";5;0;1;0
Jiang L., Hu G.;Day-Ahead Price Forecasting for Electricity Market using Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network;2018;2018 15th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision, ICARCV 2018;5;In this paper, an efficient method for the day-ahead electricity price forecasting (EPF) is proposed based on a long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network model. LSTM network has been widely used in various applications such as natural language processing and time series analysis. It is capable of learning features and long term dependencies of the historical information on the current predictions for sequential data. We propose to use LSTM model to forecast the day-ahead electricity price for Australian market at Victoria (VIC) region and Singapore market. Instead of using only historical prices as inputs to the model, we also consider exogenous variables, such as holidays, day of the week, hour of the day, weather conditions, oil prices and historical price/demand, etc. The output is the electricity price for the next hour. The future 24 hours of prices are forecasted in a recursive manner. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of four weeks for each season in VIC and Singapore markets are examined. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using real market data from both markets. The result shows that the LSTM network outperforms four popular forecasting methods and provides up to 47.3% improvement in the average daily MAPE for the VIC market. © 2018 IEEE.;"Electricity price forecasting (EPF); energy market; long-short term memory neural network; multiple steps";"Brain; Commerce; Computer vision; Costs; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Robotics; Time series analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Energy markets; Historical information; Long-term dependencies; Mean absolute percentage error; multiple steps; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network model; Power markets";5;1;1;1

Ullah M.H., Paul S., Park J.-D.;Real-Time Electricity Price Forecasting for Energy Management in Grid-Tied MTDC Microgrids;2018;2018 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition, ECCE 2018;1;In power market, electricity price forecasting is one of the challenging issues and it plays a significant role in grid-tied microgrid's (MG's) energy management systems (EMSs). Accurate forecasting can make precise economically beneficial decision not only in efficient resource scheduling, but also in real-time energy arbitrage. To maximize the profit, the idea is to buy energy at low price and sell at high. However, it is very complex and volatile task since the electricity prices are highly fluctuating in nature as a result of bidding competition among the suppliers and consumers in the electricity market. In this context, an artificial neural network based approach with an adaptive learning algorithm called resilient backpropagation was used to forecast the real-time electricity price throughout the year 2016 and forecasting error was analyzed. Result showed that the yearly mean error was 3.705IMWh and the mean absolute percentage error was in acceptable range of 5%-10% most of the cases. Also, the economical impact of the real-time electricity price forecasting to the MG's EMSs was analyzed, and a model predictive control based EMS for grid-tied multi-terminal DC (MTDC) microgrids was proposed in this paper. © 2018 IEEE.;"Artificial intelligence; DC OPF; Forecasting; Microgrid; MPC; Power market; Real-time energy management";"Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation algorithms; Commerce; Electric power transmission networks; Electronic trading; Energy conversion; Energy management; Errors; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Model predictive control; Neural networks; Power markets; Predictive control systems; Adaptive learning algorithm; DC OPF; Electricity price forecasting; Mean absolute percentage error; Micro grid; Real-time electricity prices; Real-time energy management; Resilient backpropagation; Energy management systems";5;1;1;1

This paper presents a new intelligent hybrid three-stage model for simultaneous load and price forecasting. The proposed algorithm uses wavelet and Kalman machines for the first stage load and price forecasting. Each of the load and price data is decomposed into different frequency components, and Kalman machine is used to forecast each frequency components of load and price data. Then a Kohonen Self Organizing Map (SOM) finds similar days of load frequency components and feeds them into the second stage forecasting machine. In addition, mutual information based feature selection is used to find the relevant price data and rank them based on their relevance. The second stage uses Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for forecasting of load and price frequency components, respectively. The third stage machine uses the second stage outputs and feeds them into its MLP-ANN and ANFIS machines to improve the load and price forecasting accuracy. The proposed three-stage algorithm is applied to Nordpool and mainland Spain power markets. The obtained results are compared with the recent load and price forecast algorithms, and showed that the three-stage algorithm presents a better performance for day-ahead electricity market load and price forecasting. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Feature selection; Mutual information; Neural network; Price and load forecasting; Wavelet transformation";"Commerce; Conformal mapping; Electric load forecasting; Electric utilities; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Machine components; Neural networks; Self organizing maps; Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS); Day-ahead electricity market; Kohonen self-organizing maps; Multi layer perceptron; Mutual informations; Price and load forecasting; Price forecast algorithms; Wavelet transformations; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1

Our hybrid methodology consists into two steps. The first step aims at modeling the conditional mean of the time series, using a generalized fractional model with k-factor of Gegenbauer termed the k-factor GARMA model; the parameters of this model are estimated using the wavelet approach based on the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT). The second step aims at estimating the conditional variance, so we adopt the local linear wavelet neural network (LLWNN) model. The proposed hybrid model is tested using the hourly log-returns of electricity spot price from the Nord Pool market. The empirical results were compared with the predictions of the ARFIMA–LLWNN, the k-factor GARMA–FIGARCH and the individual LLWNN models. It is shown that the proposed hybrid k-factor GARMA–LLWNN model outperforms all other competing methods.

Monteiro C., Ramirez-Rosado I.J., Fernandez-Jimenez L.A., Ribeiro M.;New probabilistic price forecasting models: Application to the Iberian electricity market;2018;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;14;This article presents original Probabilistic Price Forecasting Models, for day-ahead hourly price forecasts in electricity markets, based on a Nadaraya–Watson Kernel Density Estimator approach. A Gaussian Kernel Density Estimator function is used for each input variable, which allows to calculate the parameters of the probability density function (PDF) of a Beta distribution for the hourly price variable. Thus, valuable information is obtained from PDFs such as point forecasts, variance values, quantiles, probabilities of prices, and time series representations of forecast uncertainty. A Reliability Indicator is also introduced to give a measure of “reliability” of forecasts. The Probabilistic Price Forecasting Models were satisfactorily applied to the real-world case study of the Iberian Electricity Market. Input variables of these models include recent prices, power demands and power generations in the previous day, power demands in the previous week, forecasts of demand, wind power generation and weather for the day-ahead, and chronological data.

Anamika, Peesapati R., Kumar N.;Electricity Price Forecasting and Classification Through Wavelet-Dynamic Weighted PSO-FFNN Approach;2018;IEEE Systems Journal;11;In competitive electricity markets, accurate price forecasting is required to both power producers and consumers for planning their bidding strategies in order to maximize their own benefits. Price classification is an alternative approach to forecasting where the exact values of future prices are not mandatory. Presently, two efficient algorithms are proposed for both short term price forecasting (STPF) and classification (STPC) purposes. The algorithms include various methodologies like wavelet transform (WT), fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization (FA-PSO) and feed forward neural networks (FFNN). WT is utilized to convert the pathetic price series to an inviolable price series without losing the originality in the signal. Standard PSO (S-PSO) is implemented to tune the fixed architecture FFNN weights and biases. In the present nonlinear problem, linear variation of inertia weight does not resemble exact search process. Hence, dynamic inertia weight is accomplished by implementing the fuzzy systems in the S-PSO approach. The hybrid methodology is implemented on Spanish electricity markets for the year 2002. To validate, three types of price classes and historical price series that are utilized by many researches as input features, are considered. Various statistical indicators are evaluated to compare and validate the proposed approaches with the past approaches available in the literature survey. © 2007-2012 IEEE.;"Forecasting; fuzzy systems; neural networks (NN); particle swarm optimization (PSO); wavelet transform (WT)";"Biological systems; Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Neurons; Power markets; Wavelet transforms; Auto regressive process; Biological system modeling; Computational model; Neural network (nn); Predictive models; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)";4, 5;2;1;1

Lee D., Shin H., Baldick R.;Bivariate probabilistic wind power and real-time price forecasting and their applications to wind power bidding strategy development;2018;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;17;We build an advanced offer curve in the day-ahead electricity market for wind power producers based on the multivariate (bivariate or two-dimensional) distribution of the real-time (RT) price and wind power forecasting errors. The bivariate distribution results in more profitable offers based on the conditional probability of wind power forecasting errors with respect to the RT price forecasting errors. The standard deviation of the bivariate distribution is reduced through a novel probabilistic wind power forecasting algorithm based on a parametric approach to further increase the profitability of the offer curve. In conclusion, the test of the advanced offer curve on the data sampled from the Iberian peninsula shows that the offer curve of the bivariate distribution has a higher profitability than offer curves of the marginal distribution. © 2018 IEEE.;"correlation structure; offer curve; Probabilistic wind power forecasting; skewed student-T distribution";"Correlation methods; Costs; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Errors; Forecasting; Probabilistic logics; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Profitability; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Correlation structure; Offer Curve; Probabilistic wind power forecasting; Skewed Student-t; Wind forecasting; Power markets";4;1;1;2
Paulos J.P., Fidalgo J.N.;Load and electricity prices forecasting using generalized regression neural networks;2018;2018 International Conference on Smart Energy Systems and Technologies, SEST 2018 - Proceedings;1;Over time, the electricity price and energy consumption are increasingly growing their weight as prime foundations of the electrical sector, with their analysis and forecasts being targeted as key elements for the stable maintenance of electricity markets. The advent of smart grids is escalating the importance of forecasting because of the expected ubiquitous monitoring and growing complexity of a data-rich ever-changing milieu. So, the increasing data volatility will require forecasting tools able to rapidly readjust to a dynamic environment. The Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) approach is a solution that has recently re-emerged, emphasizing good performance, fast run-times and ease of parameterization. The merging of this model with more conventional methods allows us to obtain more sturdy solutions with shortened training times, when compared to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Overall, the performance of the GRNN, although slightly inferior to that of the ANN, is suitable, but linked to much lower training times. Ultimately, the GRNN would be a proper solution to blend with the latest smart grids features, which may require much reduced forecasting training times. © 2018 IEEE.;"Data sampling; electricity prices forecasting; load forecasting; neural networks; performance evaluation";"Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Smart power grids; Conventional methods; Data sampling; Dynamic environments; Electricity prices forecasting; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Generalized regression neural networks; Load forecasting; Performance evaluations; Electric load forecasting";5;1;1;1

Kath C., Ziel F.;The value of forecasts: Quantifying the economic gains of accurate quarter-hourly electricity price forecasts;2018;Energy Economics;14;We propose a multivariate elastic net regression forecast model for German quarter-hourly electricity spot markets. While the literature is diverse on day-ahead prediction approaches, both the intraday continuous and intraday call-auction prices have not been studied intensively with a clear focus on predictive power. Besides electricity price forecasting, we check for the impact of early day-ahead (DA) EXAA prices on intraday forecasts. Another novelty of this paper is the complementary discussion of economic benefits. A precise estimation is worthless if it cannot be utilized. We elaborate possible trading decisions based upon our forecasting scheme and analyze their monetary effects. We find that even simple electricity trading strategies can lead to substantial economic impact if combined with a decent forecasting technique. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Elastic net regression; Electricity price forecast; Forecasting; Markowitz portfolio; Portfolio analysis; Quarter-hourly spot prices";"Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Elastic net; Electricity prices; Markowitz; Portfolio analysis; Spot price; Power markets; economic analysis; economic impact; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; multivariate analysis; price dynamics; quantitative analysis; Germany";4;1;1, 2;1
Ziel F., Steinert R.;Probabilistic mid- and long-term electricity price forecasting;2018;Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews;27;The liberalization of electricity markets and the development of renewable energy sources has led to new challenges for decision makers. These challenges are accompanied by an increasing uncertainty about future electricity price movements. The increasing amount of papers, which aim to model and predict electricity prices for a short period of time provided new opportunities for market participants. However, the electricity price literature seem to be very scarce on the issue of medium- to long-term price forecasting, which is mandatory for investment and political decisions. Our paper closes this gap by introducing a new approach to simulate electricity prices with hourly resolution for several months up to three years. Considering the uncertainty of future events we are able to provide probabilistic forecasts which are able to detect probabilities for price spikes even in the long-run. As market we decided to use the EPEX day-ahead electricity market for Germany and Austria. Our model extends the X-Model which mainly utilizes the sale and purchase curve for electricity day-ahead auctions. By applying our procedure we are able to give probabilities for the due to the EEG practical relevant event of six consecutive hours of negative prices. We find that using the supply and demand curve based model in the long-run yields realistic patterns for the time series of electricity prices and leads to promising results considering common error measures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;"Electricity prices; Long-term; Negative prices; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energy; Supply and demand";"Commerce; Costs; Curve fitting; Decision making; Forecasting; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Electricity prices; Long-term; Negative prices; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energies; Supply and demand; Power markets";2, 4;2, 3;1;2
Beigaite R., Krilavicius T., Man K.L.;Electricity Price Forecasting for Nord Pool Data;2018;2018 International Conference on Platform Technology and Service, PlatCon 2018;7;In many countries deregulation of power markets was undertaken to create a more efficient market. As a result, electricity now can be purchased and sold across areas and countries more easily. For participants of electricity market it is beneficial to forecast future prices in order to optimize risks and profits as well as make future plans. A number of various methods is applied for solving this problem. However, the accuracy of forecasts is not sufficient as market spot price of electricity has features such as seasonality, spikes or high volatility. Furthermore, diverse approaches work differently with distinct countries (markets). In this paper we discuss our experiments with electricity spot price data of Lithuania's price zone in Nord Pool power market.

De Marcos R.A., Bello A., Reneses J.;Hybridisation of fundamental and composite econometric modelling for short-term electricity price forecasting;2018;International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM;;Traders and practitioners in diverse power exchanges are nowadays being most exposed to uncertainty than ever. This calls for appropriate electricity price forecasting models that can account for relevant aspects for electricity price forecasting. Therefore, some authors in the current literature have proposed combining fundamental models with econometric methods and have provided useful results for medium-term applications. However, little has been done for the short term. All of these facts encourage this work, which aims to the creation of a suitable hybrid short-term electricity price forecasting model, while extending the most commonly used hybridisation method by considering flexible combination approaches, several variables and individual model amalgamations. In order to validate the advantages and contributions of the proposed model, it has been applied to a real-size power exchange with complex price dynamics, such as the Iberian electricity market, and its performance was compared to that of other, more traditional, forecasting models. © 2018 IEEE.;"Econometric Models; Fundamental Models; Hybrid Models; Power Exchanges; Short-Term Forecasting";"Commerce; Electric rates; Forecasting; Metals; Econometric model; Fundamental models; Hybrid model; Power exchange; Short-term forecasting; Power markets";2, 4;1;1;1
Dudek G.;Probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices using kernel regression;2018;International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM;1;Electricity price forecasting has become crucial for energy companies due to its fundamental importance for decision making processes and operational management. Electricity price time series exhibit variable means, significant volatility and spikes, which places high demands on forecasting models. Moreover, in recent years researchers and practitioners have come to understand the limitations of point forecasts and require models to generate probabilistic forecasts. In contrast to point forecasts, the probabilistic forecasts takes the form of a predictive probability distribution over future quantities or events of interest. In the paper the probabilistic forecasting model based on Nadaraya- Watson estimator is proposed. The model generates the point forecasts as 24-component vectors representing day-ahead electricity prices. The probabilistic forecasts are calculated as quantiles based on the residual distribution for historical data forecasts. The performance of the proposed model is validated by testing on data from the Polish electricity market. © 2018 IEEE.;"Electricity price forecasting; Kernel regression; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile forecasts";"Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Decision making process; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Kernel regression; Operational management; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic forecasts; Residual distribution; Power markets";4;1;1;2
Diallo A., Kacsor E., Vancsa M.;Forecasting the spread between HUPX and EEX DAM prices the case of Hungarian and German wholesale electricity prices;2018;International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM;;Electricity price forecasting is a rapidly developing field. Using time series analysis to estimate future wholesale electricity prices is a popular approach, however forecasting price difference between markets is not typical. In this paper the spread between Hungarian (HUPX) and German (EEX) day-ahead power prices are forecasted, using combined ARIMA-GARCH type models. Models are built on 2011-2017 daily average price data, and forecasts are made for Q1 2018. All four applied model types (NGARCH, TGARCH, EGARCH, GJR GARCH) bring similar results, with an RMSE of 4.22-4.75 and a MAE of 2.87-2.99 while the average spread value in the forecasted period is 3.88.

Fidalgo J.N., Da Rocha E.F.N.R.;Improving electricity price forecasting trough data segmentation based on artificial immune systems;2018;International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM;1;The price evolution in electricity market with large share of renewables often exhibits a deep volatility, triggered by external factors such as wind and water availability, load level and also by business strategies of market agents. Consequently, in many real applications, the performance of electricity price is not appropriate. The goal of this article is to analyze the available market data and characterize circumstances that affect the evolution of prices, in order to allow the identification of states that promote price instability and to confirm that class segmentation allows increasing forecast performance. A regression technique (based on Artificial Neural Networks) was applied first to the whole set and then to each class individually. Performances results showed a clear advantage (above 20%) of the second approach when compared to the first one. © 2018 IEEE.;"Artificial immune systems; Clustering; Electricity markets; Neural networks; Price forecasting";"Commerce; Forecasting; Immune system; Neural networks; Artificial Immune System; Clustering; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecast performance; Price forecasting; Regression techniques; Water availability; Power markets";5;0;1;1
Chen Y., Li M., Yang Y., Li C., Li Y., Li L.;A hybrid model for electricity price forecasting based on least square support vector machines with combined kernel;2018;Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy;3;With the continuous development of the global electricity market, the electricity market needs the electricity price forecasting result to be accurate, and electricity price forecasting also has more profound practical significance. Accurate price forecasting can not only better reflect the operation of the electricity market but also help to make better decisions about the electricity market. However, the electricity price is affected by a variety of uncertain subjective and objective factors, as well as the constraints of the power system, making it more difficult to obtain accurate electricity price forecasting than electricity load forecasting. The kernel function occupies a very important position in a support vector machine (SVM), which is the key to the mature development of SVM theory. When using SVM for classification and regression, the appropriate kernel function is the basis and precondition for obtaining better classification and approximation effects. In this paper, a new combinatorial kernel function that combines RBF and UKF kernel functions is proposed and is applied to a least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and based on this, a new hybrid model empirical mode (EMD)-Mixed-LSSVM is proposed to forecast electricity price. The hybrid model puts the electricity price data after the noise reduction by the EMD into the LSSVM with the combined kernel function for calculation. In this paper, we forecast the electricity price in Australia and compare the results of EMD-Mixed-LSSVM with other methods. The results show that EMD-Mixed-LSSVM can effectively improve the accuracy of electricity price forecasting. © 2018 Author(s).;;"Commerce; Electric industry; Electric machine theory; Forecasting; Noise abatement; Support vector machines; Approximation effects; Combined kernel function; Continuous development; Electricity load forecasting; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Least square support vector machines; Least squares support vector machines; Power markets";5;0;1;0
Marcjasz G., Serafin T., Weron R.;Selection of calibration windows for day-ahead electricity price forecasting;2018;Energies;9;We conduct an extensive empirical study on the selection of calibration windows for day-ahead electricity price forecasting, which involves six year-long datasets from three major power markets and four autoregressive expert models fitted either to raw or transformed prices. Since the variability of prediction errors across windows of different lengths and across datasets can be substantial, selecting ex-ante one window is risky. Instead, we argue that averaging forecasts across different calibration windows is a robust alternative and introduce a new, well-performing weighting scheme for averaging these forecasts. © 2018 by the authors.

Itaba S., Mori H.;An Electricity Price Forecasting Model with Fuzzy Clustering Preconditioned ANN;2018;Electrical Engineering in Japan (English translation of Denki Gakkai Ronbunshi);1;In this paper, a hybrid model of fuzzy clustering and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is proposed for electricity price forecasting. Due to the complicated behavior of electricity price in power markets, market players are interested in maximizing profits while minimizing risks. As a result, more accurate models are required to deal with electricity price forecasting. This paper proposes a new method that makes use of fuzzy clustering preconditioned GRBFN (Generalized Radial Basis Function Network) to provide more accurate predicted prices. Fuzzy clustering plays a key role to prevent the number of learning data from decreasing at each cluster. GRBFN is one of efficient ANNs to approximate nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a modified GRBFN model is developed to improve the performance of GRBFN with the use of DA (Deterministic Annealing) clustering for the parameters initialization and EPSO (Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization) for optimizing the parameters of GRBFN. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of ISO New England, USA. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;"artificial neural network; clustering; electricity price; EPSO; forecasting; fuzzy logic; optimization";"Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Neural networks; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; ANN (artificial neural network); Clustering; Deterministic annealing; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; EPSO; Evolutionary particle swarm optimizations; Generalized radial basis functions; Power markets";5;0;1;0

Varshney H., Sujil A., Kumar R.;A Singular Spectrum Analysis based Approach to Price Forecasting for a Day Ahead Electricity Market;2018;India International Conference on Power Electronics, IICPE;1;Deregulation across various electricity markets created a need for an operational framework that has capability to run similar to the dynamics of real world commodity markets possessing the competitiveness to ensure long run stability, providing opportunity to every participant and maintaining the price level of commodity within the reach of consumer. The electricity framework takes into account the power system balancing constraints required to ensure its reliability and security. This complex structure with its aim of competitiveness motivated the participating entities to run the generating capacities at the optimum level, forced the operators to minimize the transmission losses and created an environment for the consumers to take the benefit of variable pricing conditions. Specially, these effects are reflected via short term electricity price forecasting (STPF) in a significant amount. The STPF created the required decision base for the entities to bid in market with an effective strategy of risk management to hedge against the highly volatile pricing events to ensure the required amount of liquidity and making better economic conditions while in case of large consumers, it helps to either curtail or schedule the loads to minimize the cost of energy. It also helps them to prepare an alternative strategy to make available the required energy via small private generating units during peak price hours. To account for different requirements of various entities, accurate price forecasting is a crucial task. The complexity of the price dynamics also involves the variations attributed to spatial effects in different operating regions such as calamities and extreme conditions. In this paper, Singular Spectrum Analysis based model is used to forecast the price. The simulations results show the accuracy of proposed model. © 2018 IEEE.;"Electricity price forecasting; Neural network; Real time forecast; Singular spectrum analysis";"Commerce; Competition; Complex networks; Costs; Deregulation; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power electronics; Risk management; Spectrum analysis; Day-ahead electricity market; Economic condition; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme conditions; Generating capacity; Real-time forecasts; Singular spectrum analysis; Transmission loss; Power markets";4, 5;2;1;1

The commercial success of the market players depends on their competitive bidding strategy which is suffuicient enough to meet the regulatory requirements and minimize the cost. Artificial neural networks due to their capability of non-linear mapping finds extensive application in the field of price forecasting. Although, they are extensively used as forecasting model, they have certain limitations which are detrimental to system performance. The training time of the artificial neural network is affected by the complexity of the system, and moreover, they require a large amount of data for complex problems. The worl presented in this article deals with the application of the generalized neuron model for forecasting the electricity price. The generalized neuron model overcomes the limitation of the conventional ANN.

While many predictive models have been already proposed to perform this task, the area of deep learning algorithms remains yet unexplored. To fill this scientific gap, we propose four different deep learning models for predicting electricity prices and we show how they lead to improvements in predictive accuracy. In addition, we also consider that, despite the large number of proposed methods for predicting electricity prices, an extensive benchmark is still missing. To tackle that, we compare and analyze the accuracy of 27 common approaches for electricity price forecasting. Based on the benchmark results, we show how the proposed deep learning models outperform the state-of-the-art methods and obtain results that are statistically significant. Finally, using the same results, we also show that: (i) machine learning methods yield, in general, a better accuracy than statistical models; (ii) moving average terms do not improve the predictive accuracy; (iii) hybrid models do not outperform their simpler counterparts. © 2018 The Author(s)";"Benchmark study; Deep learning; Electricity price forecasting";"Costs; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Power markets; Benchmark study; Electricity price forecasting; Empirical - comparisons; Forecasting electricity; Machine learning methods; Predictive accuracy; Spot electricity prices; State-of-the-art methods; Deep learning; accuracy assessment; benchmarking; comparative study; electricity; empirical analysis; forecasting method; learning; planning method; prediction; price dynamics";5;1;1;1

Pórtoles J., González C., Moguerza J.M.;Electricity Price Forecasting with Dynamic Trees: A Benchmark Against the Random Forest Approach;2018;Energies;6;Dynamic Trees are a tree-based machine learning technique specially designed for online environments where data are to be analyzed sequentially as they arrive. Our purpose is to test this methodology for the very first time for Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) by using data from the Iberian market. For benchmarking the results, we will compare them against another tree-based technique, Random Forest, a widely used method that has proven its good results in many fields. The benchmark includes several versions of the Dynamic Trees approach for a very short term EPF (one-hour ahead) and also a short term (one-day ahead) approach but only with the best versions. The numerical results show that Dynamic Trees are an adequate method, both for very short and short term EPF—even improving upon the performance of the Random Forest method. The comparison with other studies for the Iberian market suggests that Dynamic Trees is a proper and promising method for EPF. 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

An hour-ahead forecast provides market participants with the pre-dispatch prices for the next hour. It is beneficial for an active bidding strategy where amount of bids can be reviewed or modified before delivery hours. However, only a few studies have been conducted in the field of hour-ahead forecasting. This is due to most power markets apply two-settlement market structure (day-ahead and real time) or standard market design rather than single-settlement system (real time). Therefore, a hybrid multi-optimization of Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (BFOA) was designed in this study to produce accurate electricity price forecasts with optimized LSSVM parameters and input features. So far, no works has been established on multistage feature and parameter optimization using LSSVM-BFOA for hour-ahead price forecast. The model was examined on the Ontario power market. A huge number of features were selected by five stages of optimization to avoid from missing any important features. The developed LSSVM-BFOA shows higher forecast accuracy with lower complexity than most of the existing models. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Kuo P.-H., Huang C.-J.;An electricity price forecasting model by hybrid structured deep neural networks;2018;Sustainability (Switzerland);51;Electricity price is a key influencer in the electricity market. Electricity market trades by each participant are based on electricity price. The electricity price adjusted with the change in supply and demand relationship can reflect the real value of electricity in the transaction process. However, for the power generating party, bidding strategy determines the level of profit, and the accurate prediction of electricity price could make it possible to determine a more accurate bidding price. This cannot only reduce transaction risk, but also seize opportunities in the electricity market. In order to effectively estimate electricity price, this paper proposes an electricity price forecasting system based on the combination of 2 deep neural networks, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). In order to compare the overall performance of each algorithm, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root-Mean-Square error (RMSE) evaluating measures were applied in the experiments of this paper. Experiment results show that compared with other traditional machine learning methods, the prediction performance of the estimating model proposed in this paper is proven to be the best.

The proposed algorithm is consisting of signal processing technique based on wavelet transform (WT), a Time Series Time Delay Artificial Neural Network (TSDNN) based prediction network and an error predicting algorithm (EP) based on TSDNN. A comprehensive comparative analysis using the proposed hybrid model, with the specified data from ISO New England website shows significant improvement in forecast error by more than 71.8% for daily price forecasts. Furthermore, a high degree of accuracy of the proposed model is established due to low values obtained for the root mean square error (RMS) and mean absolute error (MAE). The analysis of the performance of the algorithm using both, standard and new performance parameters-Are done to measure the robustness of the proposed hybrid intelligent model. In addition, the rapid adaptability of the proposed hybrid model is also evaluated using the ISO NE electricity market. © 2017 IEEE.;"Artificial Neural Network; Electric energy markets; Electricity market; short-term price forecasting; wavelet transform";"Commerce; Electric industry; Errors; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; Time delay; Time series; Timing circuits; Wavelet transforms; Electric energy markets; Electricity price forecasting; High degree of accuracy; Hybrid intelligent algorithms; Hybrid intelligent model; Short-term price forecasting; Signal processing technique; Time delay neural networks; Power markets";4, 5;0;1;0
Alshejari A., Kodogiannis V.S.;Day ahead hourly electricity price prediction in ISO new England market using neuro-fuzzy systems;2018;2017 Intelligent Systems Conference, IntelliSys 2017;1;Electricity price forecasting is a potential challenge for market participants and managers due to the high volatility of electricity prices. Price forecasting is also considered as an important management goal for market participants since it forms the basis of maximizing profits. These markets are usually organized in power pools and administrated by the independent system operator (ISO). The aim of this study is to examine the performance of asymmetric neuro-fuzzy network models for day-ahead electricity price forecasting in the ISO New England market. The implemented model has been developed with two alternative defuzzification models. The first model follows the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang scheme, while the second follows the traditional centre of average method. A clustering scheme is utilised as a pre-processing step to derive the necessary number of clusters and eventually the number of fuzzy rules in the network. Simulation results corresponding to the minimum and maximum electricity price indicate that the proposed network architectures could provide a considerable improvement for the forecasting accuracy compared to alternative learning-based schemes. © 2017 IEEE.;"clustering; Electricity price forecasting; neural networks; neuro-fuzzy systems; prediction";"Commerce; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Intelligent systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; clustering; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Independent system operators; Learning based schemes; Market participants; Neuro-fuzzy network; Neurofuzzy system; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Ma Z., Zhong H., Xie L., Xia Q., Kang C.;Month ahead average daily electricity price profile forecasting based on a hybrid nonlinear regression and SVM model: an ERCOT case study;2018;Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy;10;With the deregulation of the electric power industry, electricity price forecasting plays an increasingly important role in electricity markets, especially for retailors and investment decision making. Month ahead average daily electricity price profile forecasting is proposed for the first time in this paper. A hybrid nonlinear regression and support vector machine (SVM) model is proposed. Off-peak hours, peak hours in peak months and peak hours in off-peak months are distinguished and different methods are designed to improve the forecast accuracy. A nonlinear regression model with deviation compensation is proposed to forecast the prices of off-peak hours and peak hours in off-peak months. SVM is adopted to forecast the prices of peak hours in peak months. Case studies based on data from ERCOT validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method. © 2018, The Author(s).;"Electric reliability council of Texas (ERCOT); Electricity price forecasting; Month ahead average daily electricity price profile; Nonlinear regression model; Support vector machine (SVM)";"Costs; Decision making; Deregulation; Electric industry; Forecasting; Investments; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Electric power industries; Electric reliability council of texas; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecast accuracy; Investment decision making; Non-linear regression; Nonlinear regression models; Power markets";5;2;1;1
Vilar J., Aneiros G., Raña P.;Prediction intervals for electricity demand and price using functional data;2018;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;7;This paper provides two procedures to obtain prediction intervals for electricity demand and price based on functional data. The proposed procedures are related to one day ahead pointwise forecast. In particular, the first method uses a nonparametric autoregressive model and the second one uses a partial linear semi-parametric model, in which exogenous scalar covariates are incorporated in a linear way. In both cases, the proposed procedures for the construction of the prediction intervals use residual-based bootstrap algorithms, which allows also to obtain estimates of the prediction density. Applications to the Spanish Electricity Market, in year 2012, are reported. This work extends and complements the results of Aneiros et al. (2016), focused on pointwise forecasts of next-day electricity demand and price daily curves. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;"Electricity markets; Functional data; Functional time series forecasting; Load and price; Prediction intervals";"Commerce; Costs; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Auto regressive models; Bootstrap algorithms; Electricity demands; Functional datas; Functional time series; Prediction interval; Semi-parametric modeling; Spanish electricity markets; Power markets";4;1;1;2
Uniejewski B., Weron R., Ziel F.;Variance Stabilizing Transformations for Electricity Spot Price Forecasting;2018;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;33;Most electricity spot price series exhibit price spikes. These extreme observations may significantly impact the obtained model estimates and hence reduce efficiency of the employed predictive algorithms. For markets with only positive prices, the logarithmic transform is the single most commonly used technique to reduce spike severity and consequently stabilize the variance. However, for datasets with very close to zero (like the Spanish) or negative (like the German) prices the log-transform is not feasible. What reasonable choices do we have then? To address this issue, we evaluate 16 variance stabilizing transformations within a comprehensive forecasting study involving two model classes (regression models, neural networks) and 12 datasets from diverse power markets. We show that the probability integral transform combined with the standard Gaussian distribution yields the best approach, significantly better than many of the considered alternatives. © 2017 IEEE.;"Diebold-mariano test; electricity spot price; forecasting; price spike; probability integral transform; variance stabilizing transformation";"Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Integral equations; Mathematical transformations; Benchmark testing; Diebold; Electricity spot price; Europe; Indexes; Integral transform; Predictive models; Price spike; Variance stabilizing transformation; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1
Ibrahim A.M.;Modeling of energy market prices using truncated distribution functions based on maximum likelihood parametric estimator;2018;2017 19th International Middle-East Power Systems Conference, MEPCON 2017 - Proceedings;;This article presents a model for Energy Market Prices (EMP). Generally, if the EMP model omitted some of the data important features, non-optimal actions will be taken. The stochastic nature of energy market prices and multimodality are the two main important energy market prices features. However although, the majority of EMP models are usually neglect the multimodal nature of the energy market. This work suggests a novel method using truncated distribution functions based on Maximum Likelihood Parametric Estimator (MLPE). k-mean clustering mechanism is utilized. In addition, a new strategy composed of Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) with Epanchnikov Kernel Smoother (EKS) is utilized for EMP probability modeling and scenario generation. The set of the suggested techniques can be applied to any market by just depending on the availability of historical market data. The model is applied to Polish energy market. The results show that the model duplicated perfectly the energy prices data distribution. © 2017 IEEE.;"Energy market prices; Maximum likelihood parametric estimator; Multimodality; Scenario generation; Truncated distribution functions";"Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Distribution functions; Intelligent systems; Maximum likelihood; Monte Carlo methods; Parameter estimation; Stochastic systems; Energy markets; Important features; Monte carlo simulations (MCS); Multi-modality; Probability modeling; Scenario generation; Stochastic nature; Truncated distributions; Power markets";4;1;1;2

An accurate method of forecasting is required for several economic and operational advantages. In this paper effectiveness of artificial neural network (ANN) is evaluated by selecting the most influential input variable based forecasting of price in Australian electricity market using the price and total demand data of Queensland (QLD) region from January 2016 to June 2017. Using these data, monthly and weekly forecasting of electricity price is carried out. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) is determined by evaluating the effectiveness of proposed method.

Automated negotiation plays a crucial role in the decision support for energy transactions due to the constant need for players to engage in bilateral negotiations. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate bilateral contract prices, which is essential to support market players in their decisions, enabling adequate risk management of the negotiation process. The proposed approach uses an adaptation of the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm to choose the best from a set of possible contract prices forecasts that are determined using several methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), among others. The learning process assesses the probability of success of each forecasting method, by comparing the expected negotiation price with the historic data contracts of competitor players. The negotiation scenario identified as the most probable scenario that the player will face during the negotiation process is the one that presents the higher expected utility value. This approach allows the supported player to be prepared for the negotiation scenario that is the most likely to represent a reliable approximation of the actual negotiation environment. © 2017 IEEE.;"bilateral contracts; decision support; electricity market; learning algorithm; negotiation process";"Commerce; Costs; Decision support systems; Neural networks; Power markets; Reinforcement learning; Risk management; Risk perception; Support vector machines; Automated negotiations; Bilateral contracts; Bilateral negotiations; Decision supports; Forecasting methods; Negotiation process; Probability of success; Restructuring process; Learning algorithms";5;3;0;2
Ziel F., Weron R.;Day-ahead electricity price forecasting with high-dimensional structures: Univariate vs. multivariate modeling frameworks;2018;Energy Economics;50;We conduct an extensive empirical study on short-term electricity price forecasting (EPF) to address the long-standing question if the optimal model structure for EPF is univariate or multivariate. We provide evidence that despite a minor edge in predictive performance overall, the multivariate modeling framework does not uniformly outperform the univariate one across all 12 considered datasets, seasons of the year or hours of the day, and at times is outperformed by the latter. This is an indication that combining advanced structures or the corresponding forecasts from both modeling approaches can bring a further improvement in forecasting accuracy. We show that this indeed can be the case, even for a simple averaging scheme involving only two models. Finally, we also analyze variable selection for the best performing high-dimensional lasso-type models, thus provide guidelines to structuring better performing forecasting model designs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;"Day-ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combination; Lasso; Multivariate modeling; Regression; Univariate modeling; Variable selection";"Costs; Forecasting; Structural optimization; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combinations; Lasso; Multivariate modeling; Regression; Univariate models; Variable selection; Power markets; conceptual framework; electricity supply; energy market; modeling; multivariate analysis; price dynamics; regression analysis";4;1;1;1
Zhang Y., Li C., Li L.;Wavelet transform and Kernel-based extreme learning machine for electricity price forecasting;2018;Energy Systems;7;In deregulated electricity markets, sophisticated factors, such as the weather, the season, high frequencies, the presence of jumps and the relationship between electricity loads and prices, make electricity prices difficult to predict. To increase the accuracy of electricity price forecasting, this paper investigates a hybrid approach that is based on a combination of the wavelet transform, a kernel-based extreme learning machine and a particle swarm optimization algorithm. The performance and robustness of the proposed method are evaluated by using electricity price data from two Australian districts (New South Wales and Victoria) and Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) electricity markets. These case studies show that the proposed method can effectively capture the nonlinearity features from the price data series with a smaller computation time cost and high prediction accuracy compared with other price forecasting methods.

Lago J., De Ridder F., Vrancx P., De Schutter B.;Forecasting day-ahead electricity prices in Europe: The importance of considering market integration;2018;Applied Energy;73;Motivated by the increasing integration among electricity markets, in this paper we propose two different methods to incorporate market integration in electricity price forecasting and to improve the predictive performance. First, we propose a deep neural network that considers features from connected markets to improve the predictive accuracy in a local market. To measure the importance of these features, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm that, by using Bayesian optimization and functional analysis of variance, evaluates the effect of the features on the algorithm performance. In addition, using market integration, we propose a second model that, by simultaneously predicting prices from two markets, improves the forecasting accuracy even further. As a case study, we consider the electricity market in Belgium and the improvements in forecasting accuracy when using various French electricity features. We show that the two proposed models lead to improvements that are statistically significant. Particularly, due to market integration, the predictive accuracy is improved from 15.7% to 12.5% sMAPE (symmetric mean absolute percentage error). In addition, we show that the proposed feature selection algorithm is able to perform a correct assessment, i.e. to discard the irrelevant features. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;"Bayesian optimization; Deep neural networks; Electricity market integration; Electricity price forecasting; Functional ANOVA";"Bayesian networks; Commerce; Costs; Deep neural networks; Electric industry; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Integration; Optimization; Algorithm performance; Bayesian optimization; Electricity price forecasting; Feature selection algorithm; Forecasting accuracy; Functional ANOVA; Mean absolute percentage error; Predictive performance; Power markets; algorithm; artificial neural network; electricity; energy market; forecasting method; integrated approach; market conditions; optimization; price determination; variance analysis; Belgium";5;1;1;1
Zhao Z., Wang C., Nokleby M., Miller C.J.;Improving short-term electricity price forecasting using day-ahead LMP with ARIMA models;2018;IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting;2;Short-term electricity price forecasting has become important for demand side management and power generation scheduling. Especially as the electricity market is becomes more competitive, a more accurate price prediction than the day-ahead locational marginal price (DALMP) published by the independent system operator (ISO) will benefit participants in the market by increasing profit or improving load demand scheduling. Hence, the main idea of this paper is to use autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to obtain a better LMP prediction than the DALMP by utilizing the published DALMP, historical real-time LMP (RTLMP) and other useful information. First, a set of seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models utilizing the DALMP and historical RTLMP are developed and compared with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models that use the differences between DALMP and RTLMP on their forecasting capability. A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is implemented to further improve the forecasting by accounting for the price volatility. The models are trained and evaluated using real market data in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region. The evaluation results indicate that the ARMAX-GARCH model, where an exogenous time series indicates weekend days, improves the short-term electricity price prediction accuracy and outperforms the other proposed ARIMA models. © 2017 IEEE.;"ARIMA models; Electricity market; Locational marginal price; Price prediction";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Scheduling; ARIMA models; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Autoregressive moving average model; Electricity price forecasting; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Independent system operators; Locational marginal prices; Price prediction; Power markets";4;1;1;1

This has led researchers in the last years to intensely search for accurate forecasting methods, contributing to better risk assessment, with significant financial repercussions. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines similar and recent day-based selection, correlation and wavelet analysis in a pre-processing stage. Afterwards a feedforward neural network is used alongside Bat and Scaled Conjugate Gradient Algorithms to improve the traditional neural network learning capability. Another feature is the method's capacity to fine-tune neural network architecture and wavelet decomposition, for which there is no optimal paradigm.

Li H., Wang G., Li G., Wang H., Wu C., Fu Z.;A deep learning approach for electricity price forecasting using stacked autoencoders;2018;IET Conference Publications;;Electricity price is a core indicator for reflecting the operation of the electricity market and evaluating the efficiency of market competition. It is the basis for decision-making in the electricity market. With the continuous development of global power marketization, the role of electricity price in the electricity market has received increasing attention. Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting can provide guidance for bidding strategies of market participants, thereby reducing bidding risks of participants and providing them with a stable return. However, due to the complex nature of electricity prices such as high volatility, high frequency, nonlinearity and non-stationarity, it is difficult to accurately predict electricity prices in advance. To improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a market clearing prices (MCPs) prediction method based on wavelet transforms (WT) and stacked autoencoders (SAEs). The deep learning framework comprises two stages is introduced in this work. First, WT is employed to decompose raw MCPs data into different frequency series for better behaviors. Second, the nonlinear features and invariant structures of each frequency are completely extracted by layer-wise pre-training based SAEs. The effectiveness of the proposed prediction method is verified by using actual price data from the Australian electricity market. The experimental results show that the proposed method obtains more accurate prediction, better versatility and practicability compared with several other prediction methods. © 2018 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The threshold is endogenous and depends on load data in three of the cases. A theoretical model demonstrates that supply constraints could explain price spikes and that prices would display less persistence in those cases. Estimation results confirm that presence of non-linearity in the evolution of prices. However, inclusion of the load data does not improve performance, which provides evidence against this hypothesis. The model where the threshold depends on the change in the past price is best. © 2018, University of Nebraska.

García F., Guijarro F., Oliver J., Tamošiūnienė R.;Hybrid fuzzy neural network to predict price direction in the German DAX-30 index;2018;Technological and Economic Development of Economy;11;Intraday trading rules require accurate information about the future short term market evolution. For that reason, next-day market trend prediction has attracted the attention of both academics and practitioners. This interest has increased in recent years, as different methodologies have been applied to this end. Usually, machine learning techniques are used such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees. The input variables of most of the studies are traditional technical indicators which are used by professional traders to implement investment strategies. We analyse if these indicators have predictive power on the German DAX-30 stock index by applying a hybrid fuzzy neural network to predict the one-day ahead direction of index. We implement different models depending on whether all the indicators and oscillators are used as inputs, or if a linear combination of them obtained through a factor analysis is used instead. In order to guarantee for the robustness of the results, we train and apply the HyFIS models on randomly selected subsamples 10,000 times. The results show that the reduction of the dimension through the factorial analysis generates more profitable and less risky strategies. © 2018 The Author(s).;"Artificial neural networks; Fuzzy rule-based systems; HyFIS; Stock exchange index; Technical indicators; Trend forecasting";;−1;−1;−1;−1
Menon K.C., Menon D.G., Menon R.V.;Indian electricity power market (Iex, Kerala Region) spot price: Forecasting using ARIMA model;2018;Journal of Advanced Research in Dynamical and Control Systems;;Electricity traded as a commodity have distinct characteristics of being completely fungible, simultaneous in a generation to usage & at any given time, there should be a near perfect supply-demand equilibrium in the power grids. Smart grids use ancillary services & demand response programs to manage any demand fluctuations. Independent System Operators (ISOs) & Regional Transmission Organisations (RTO) are responsible for keeping the grid balanced with generation & load. Power Grid Corporation (ISO), Indian Energy Exchange (ISO) & Kerala State Electricity Board (RTO) are the key players who perform this function for Kerala region. IEX manage the energy markets by operating three submarkets day-ahead, real-time& capacity markets. Through day-ahead market, electricity generators &load-serving entities submit their bids to receive & offer electricity to the power grid based on varying cost on each hour for the next operating day. In the real-time market, ISO & RTOs manage these changes in production & consumption throughout the day. They optimize the generation dispatch schedule where they consider generation cost & transmission constraints. Capacity markets are employed to have study flow of capital investments in the market thereby increasing the generation capacity. Currently, KSEB forecast & schedule power generation to ensure sufficient power is available at its disposal for transmission. But with generation capacity standing at a mere 30% of demand, it has to depend upon bulk purchases. To bring transparency to KSEB’s procurement programme, the Kerala state regulatory commission (erc Kerala) have provided adequate guidelines to consider commodity markets as well along with its traditional flat-ratecontracts. On this research study, we are forecasting day-ahead electricity spot price at IEX Kerala region using modern electrometric techniques. The time series analysis of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is applied to the historical IEX spot price data starting from 1st February 2017 to 31st January of 2018. In every deregulated electricity market, it’s a practice to perform the price forecasting first and then to prepare the bids accordingly. KSEB can also apply this technique to improve their procurement efficiency. From 2017 onwards, IEX has created a new separate bid region for the Kerala market, making Kerala specific market study very relevant. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Uniejewski B., Weron R.;Efficient forecasting of electricity spot prices with expert and LASSO models;2018;Energies;9;Recent electricity price forecasting (EPF) studies suggest that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) leads to well performing models that are generally better than those obtained from other variable selection schemes. By conducting an empirical study involving datasets from two major power markets (Nord Pool and PJM Interconnection), three expert models, two multi-parameter regression (called baseline) models and four variance stabilizing transformations combined with the seasonal component approach, we discuss the optimal way of implementing the LASSO. We show that using a complex baseline model with nearly 400 explanatory variables, a well chosen variance stabilizing transformation (asinh or N-PIT), and a procedure that recalibrates the LASSO regularization parameter once or twice a day indeed leads to significant accuracy gains compared to the typically considered EPF models. Moreover, by analyzing the structures of the best LASSO-estimated models, we identify the most important explanatory variables and thus provide guidelines to structuring better performing models. © 2018 MDPI AG.

Ugurlu U., Oksuz I., Tas O.;Electricity price forecasting using recurrent neural networks;2018;Energies;38;Accurate electricity price forecasting has become a substantial requirement since the liberalization of the electricity markets. Due to the challenging nature of electricity prices, which includes high volatility, sharp price spikes and seasonality, various types of electricity price forecasting models still compete and cannot outperform each other consistently. Neural Networks have been successfully used in machine learning problems and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been proposed to address time-dependent learning problems. In particular, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are tailor-made for time series price estimation. In this paper, we propose to use multi-layer Gated Recurrent Units as a new technique for electricity price forecasting. We have trained a variety of algorithms with three-year rolling window and compared the results with the RNNs. In our experiments, three-layered GRUs outperformed all other neural network structures and state-of-the-art statistical techniques in a statistically significant manner in the Turkish day-ahead market. © 2018 The Author(s).;"Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Electricity price forecasting; Gated recurrent units; Long short term memory; Turkish day-ahead market";"Artificial intelligence; Brain; Commerce; Deep learning; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Gated recurrent units; Machine learning problem; Neural network structures; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Statistical techniques; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Gligorić Z., Štrbac Savić S., Grujić A., Negovanović M., Musić O.;Short-term electricity price forecasting model using interval-valued autoregressive process;2018;Energies;2;The uncertainty that dominates in the functioning of the electricity market is of great significance and arises, generally, because of the time imbalance in electricity consumption rates and power plants' production capacity, as well as the influence of many other factors (weather conditions, fuel costs, power plant operating costs, regulations, etc.). In this paper we try to incorporate this uncertainty in the electricity price forecasting model by applying interval numbers to express the price of electricity, with no intention of exploring influencing factors. This paper represents a hybrid model based on fuzzy C-mean clustering and the interval-valued autoregressive process for forecasting the short-term electricity price. A fuzzy C-mean algorithm was used to create interval time series to be forecasted by the interval autoregressive process. In this way, the efficiency of forecasting is improved because we predict the interval, not the crisp value where the price will be. This approach increases the flexibility of the forecasting model. © 2018 by the authors.

Giovanelli C., Sierla S., Ichise R., Vyatkin V.;Exploiting artificial neural networks for the prediction of ancillary energy market prices;2018;Energies;5;The increase of distributed energy resources in the smart grid calls for new ways to profitably exploit these resources, which can participate in day-ahead ancillary energy markets by providing flexibility. Higher profits are available for resource owners that are able to anticipate price peaks and hours of low prices or zero prices, as well as to control the resource in such a way that exploits the price fluctuations. Thus, this study presents a solution in which artificial neural networks are exploited to predict the day-ahead ancillary energy market prices. The study employs the frequency containment reserve for the normal operations market as a case study and presents the methodology utilized for the prediction of the case study ancillary market prices. The relevant data sources for predicting the market prices are identified, then the frequency containment reserve market prices are analyzed and compared with the spot market prices. In addition, the methodology describes the choices behind the definition of the model validation method and the performance evaluation coefficient utilized in the study. Moreover, the empirical processes for designing an artificial neural network model are presented. The performance of the artificial neural network model is evaluated in detail by means of several experiments, showing robustness and adaptiveness to the fast-changing price behaviors. Finally, the developed artificial neural network model is shown to have better performance than two state of the art models, support vector regression and ARIMA, respectively. © 2018 by the authors.

In medium term forecast, electricity price can be predicted for several weeks ahead up to a year or few months ahead. It is useful for resources reallocation where the market players have to manage the price risk on the expected market scenario. However, researches on medium term price forecast have also exhibited low forecast accuracy. This is due to the limited historical data for training and testing purposes. Therefore, an optimisation technique of Genetic Algorithm (GA) for Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) was developed in this study to provide an accurate electricity price forecast with optimised LSSVM parameters and input features. So far, no literature has been found on feature and parameter selections using the method of LSSVM-GA for medium term price prediction. The model was examined on the Ontario power market; which is reported as among the most volatile market worldwide. The monthly average of Hourly Ontario Electricity Price (HOEP) for the past 12 months and month index are selected as the input features. The developed LSSVM-GA shows higher forecast accuracy with lower complexity than the existing models. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

The vitality of the market is increasing year by year. Market participants are gradually exploring reasonable bidding strategies, and the accurate electricity price forecasting is a joint demand for all the market members. With comprehensive considerations of the social economic background, the structure of the power system, the market development state, and other factors in Yunnan, this paper analyzes various factors and rules that have effects on the electricity price in day-ahead market. Furthermore, a successful application of an auto regressive moving average (ARMA) model to electricity price forecasting (EPF) is presented. The case study based on real data of day-ahead market in Yunnan shows that the proposed model could reflect the characteristics of electricity price and the results prove this model's effectivity. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.;"Electricity markets; Forecasting; Market clearing price; Time series analysis";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric power system economics; Environmental management; Forecasting; Irrigation; Soil conservation; Time series analysis; Water conservation; Water management; Water resources exploration; Watersheds; Auto regressive moving average modeling; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Market Clearing Price; Market development; Market participants; Trading mechanism; Power markets";4;1;1;1
Meier J.-H., Schneider S., Schönfeldt T., Schüller P., Wanke B.;Electricity price forecasting: A methodological ANN-based approach with special consideration of time series properties;2018;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;;If one examines the spot price series of electrical power over the course of time, it is striking that the electricity price across the day takes a course that is determined by power consumption following a day and night rhythm. This daily course changes in its height and temporal extent in both, the course of the week, as well as with the course of the year. This study deals methodologically with non-linear correlative and autocorrelative time series properties of the electricity spot price. We contribute the usage of non-fully connectionist networks in relation to fully connectionist networks to decompose non-linear correlative time series properties. Additionally, we contribute the usage of long short-term-memory network (LSTM) to discover and to deal with autocorrelation effects. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;"ARIMAX; Artificial neural network; Electricity prices; LSTM";"Costs; Industrial research; Knowledge management; Long short-term memory; Neural networks; Time series; ARIMAX; Connectionist networks; Electrical power; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; LSTM; Short term memory; Power markets";4, 5;0;1;1
Monteiro C., Ramirez-Rosado I.J., Fernandez-Jimenez L.A.;Probabilistic electricity price forecasting models by aggregation of competitive predictors;2018;Energies;;This article presents original probabilistic price forecasting meta-models (PPFMCP models), by aggregation of competitive predictors, for day-ahead hourly probabilistic price forecasting. The best twenty predictors of the EEM2016 EPF competition are used to create ensembles of hourly spot price forecasts. For each hour, the parameter values of the probability density function (PDF) of a Beta distribution for the output variable (hourly price) can be directly obtained from the expected and variance values associated to the ensemble for such hour, using three aggregation strategies of predictor forecasts corresponding to three PPFMCP models. A Reliability Indicator (RI) and a Loss function Indicator (LI) are also introduced to give a measure of uncertainty of probabilistic price forecasts. The three PPFMCP models were satisfactorily applied to the real-world case study of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). Results from PPFMCP models showed that PPFMCP model 2, which uses aggregation by weight values according to daily ranks of predictors, was the best probabilistic meta-model from a point of view of mean absolute errors, as well as of RI and LI. PPFMCP model 1, which uses the averaging of predictor forecasts, was the second best meta-model. PPFMCP models allow evaluations of risk decisions based on the price to be made. © 2018 by the authors.

Perez-Mora N., Alomar M.L., Martinez-Moll V.;Spanish energy market: Overview towards price forecast;2018;International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy;1;This paper aims to give an overview of the Spanish Electric Market. This energy market is liberalized and complex due the new and modified rules along time. Due these circumstances the hourly energy prices may vary tremendously. The goal of this work is to analyze in detail the generation technologies, their strategies and energy mix to gain awareness and knowledge to evaluate energy price fluctuations. Two methods are used to forecast in different time horizons: ARIMAX and NARX. Both methods are homologous, using historical energy prices and optionally an explanatory variable. Three options are studied: No explanatory, energy demand and competitive market. Once the models are developed and trained, the results achieved are helpful to understand further changes in the market. These energy forecasts are competent to schedule energy generation and/or consumption. © 2018, Econjournals. All rights reserved.;"Energy Market; Forecasting; Time Series";;4, 5;1;1;1
Ebrahimian H., Barmayoon S., Mohammadi M., Ghadimi N.;The price prediction for the energy market based on a new method;2018;Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja ;82;Regarding the complex behaviour of price signalling, its prediction is difficult, where an accurate forecasting can play an important role in electricity markets. In this paper, a feature selection based on mutual information is implemented for day ahead prediction of electricity prices, which are so valuable for determining the redundancy and relevancy of selected features. A combination of wavelet transform (WT) and a hybrid forecast method is presented based on a neural network (NN). Furthermore, an intelligent algorithm is considered for a prediction process to set the proposed forecast engine free parameters based NN. This optimisation process improved the accuracy of the proposed model. To demonstrate the validity of this model, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) electricity market is considered as a test case and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods. These comparisons illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

González J.P., Roque A.M.S., Pérez E.A.;Forecasting functional time series with a new hilbertian ARMAX model: Application to electricity price forecasting;2018;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;38;A functional time series is the realization of a stochastic process where each observation is a continuous function defined on a finite interval. These processes are commonly found in electricity markets and are gaining more importance as more market data become available and markets head toward continuous-time marginal pricing approaches. Forecasting these time series requires models that operate with continuous functions. This paper proposes a new functional forecasting method that attempts to generalize the standard seasonal ARMAX time series model to the L2 Hilbert space. The structure of the proposed model is a linear regression where functional parameters operate on functional variables. The variables can be lagged values of the series (autoregressive terms), past observed innovations (moving average terms), or exogenous variables. In this approach, the functional parameters used are integral operators whose kernels are modeled as linear combinations of sigmoid functions. The parameters of each sigmoid are optimized using a Quasi-Newton algorithm that minimizes the sum of squared errors. This novel approach allows us to estimate the moving average terms in functional time series models. The new model is tested by forecasting the daily price profile of the Spanish and German electricity markets and it is compared to other functional reference models. © 2017 IEEE.;"Electricity price forecasting; Functional ARMAX model; Functional data analysis; Functional time series";"Commerce; Continuous time systems; Costs; Forecasting; Functions; Power markets; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Time series; ARMAX model; Electricity price forecasting; Functional data analysis; Functional forecasting; Functional parameters; Functional time series; Quasi-newton algorithm; Sum of squared errors; Time series analysis";4;1;1;1
Khajeh M.G., Maleki A., Rosen M.A., Ahmadi M.H.;Electricity price forecasting using neural networks with an improved iterative training algorithm;2018;International Journal of Ambient Energy;11;In a competitive electricity market, the forecasting of energy prices is an important activity for all market participants either for developing bidding strategies or for making investment decisions. In this article, a new forecasting strategy is proposed for short-term prediction of the electricity price, which is a complex quantity with nonlinear, volatile and time-dependent behaviour. Our forecast strategy includes two novelties: a new two-stage feature selection algorithm and a new iterative training algorithm. The feature selection algorithm has two filtering stages to remove irrelevant and redundant candidate inputs, respectively. This algorithm is based on mutual information and correlation analysis. The improved iterative training algorithm is composed of two neural networks in which the output of the first neural network is one of the inputs to the second. The overall proposed strategy is applied to the Pennsylvania–New Jersey–Maryland (PJM) electricity markets and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;"Artificial neural network; Electricity price forecasting; Improved iterative training algorithm; Two-stage feature selection";"Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Investments; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Competitive electricity markets; Correlation analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Feature selection algorithm; Investment decisions; Short term prediction; Time-dependent behaviour; Training algorithms; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Tee J.E.C., Teo T.T., Logenthiran T., Woo W.L., Abidi K.;Day-ahead forecasting of wholesale electricity pricing using extreme learning machine;2017;IEEE Region 10 Annual International Conference, Proceedings/TENCON;5;In a deregulated electricity market where consumers can prepare bidding plans and purchase electricity directly from supplies, consumers can expect the price to fluctuate based on the demand. The consumers can also make economic beneficial decision to use electricity when the price is low. In this context, accurate forecast of the electricity price enable the consumers to plan and make such decisions. This paper proposes a methodology to forecast day-ahead electricity pricing using extreme learning machine.

Rafiei M., Niknam T., Khooban M.H.;Probabilistic electricity price forecasting by improved clonal selection algorithm and wavelet preprocessing;2017;Neural Computing and Applications;15;Probabilistic forecasting is an appropriate tool that helps electricity markets participants to improve their decision making. Due to changes in electricity prices, the point forecasting accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Hence, participants are more interested in results of probabilistic forecasting methods such as prediction intervals method. In this paper, a hybrid approach for probabilistic electricity price forecasting is presented. This model is based on using improved clonal selection algorithm and extreme learning machine for neural networks training process and wavelet preprocess. The wavelet is utilized to decompose data into well behaved subsets, which increases accuracy of the model. Also, due to the high required computational time for training the neural networks, autocorrelation function is used to reduce the number of neural networks inputs. Finally, in order to evaluate the proposed probabilistic forecasting method, the Ontario and Australian electricity markets data are used. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.;"Autocorrelation function; Improved clonal selection algorithm; Prediction intervals; Probabilistic forecasting; Wavelet preprocess";"Algorithms; Autocorrelation; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Forecasting; Learning systems; Autocorrelation functions; Clonal selection algorithms; Prediction interval; Preprocess; Probabilistic forecasting; Power markets";4;1;1;2
Ghofrani M., Azimi R., Najafabadi F.M., Myers N.;A new day-ahead hourly electricity price forecasting framework;2017;2017 North American Power Symposium, NAPS 2017;2;This paper develops a hybrid electricity price-forecasting framework to improve the accuracy of prediction. A novel clustering method is proposed that uses a modified game theoretic self-organizing map (GTSOM) and neural gas (NG) along with competitive Hebbian Learning (CHL) to provide a better vector quantization (VQ). To resolve the deficiency of the original SOM, five strategies are proposed to enable the non-winning neurons to participate in the learning phase. Using GTSOM, the price-load input data are clustered into proper number of subsets. A novel cluster-selection method is proposed to select the most appropriate subset whose time-series data is processed to provide the inputs for the neural networks. Finally, Bayesian method is used to train the networks and forecast the electricity price. Market price data from an independent system operator is used to evaluate the algorithm performance. Furthermore, a comparison of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art forecasting techniques shows a significant improvement in the accuracy of the price forecast. © 2017 IEEE.;"Bayesian learning; clustering; electricity price; forecasting; game theory; neural networks; persistence method; self-organizing map";"Bayesian networks; Conformal mapping; Costs; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Game theory; Neural networks; Self organizing maps; Algorithm performance; Bayesian learning; clustering; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting techniques; Independent system operators; persistence method; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Talari S., Shafie-khah M., Osório G.J., Wang F., Heidari A., Catalão J.P.S.;Price forecasting of electricity markets in the presence of a high penetration of wind power generators;2017;Sustainability (Switzerland);4;"Price forecasting plays a vital role in the day-ahead markets. Once sellers and buyers access an accurate price forecasting, managing the economic risk can be conducted appropriately through offering or bidding suitable prices. In networks with high wind power penetration, the electricity price is influenced by wind energy; therefore, price forecasting can be more complicated. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for price forecasting of day-ahead markets, with high penetration of wind generators based on Wavelet transform, bivariate Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN). To this end, a weighted time series for wind dominated power systems is calculated and added to a bivariate ARIMA model along with the price time series. Moreover, RBFN is applied as a tool to correct the estimation error, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the structure and adapt the RBFN to the particular training set. This method is evaluated on the Spanish electricity market, which shows the efficiency of this approach. This method has less error compared with other methods especially when it considers the effects of large-scale wind generators. © 2017 by the authors.";"Bivariate ARIMA; Hybrid method; Price forecasting; Wavelet transform; Wind generator";"accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; economic analysis; electricity industry; optimization; power generation; price dynamics; wavelet analysis; wind power";4, 5;1;1;1

However, it is a difficult and challenging task owing to the characteristics of the nonlinearity, non-stationarity and uncertainty of the price series. This study proposes a hybrid improved strategy which incorporates data preprocessor components and a forecasting engine component to enhance the forecasting accuracy of the electricity price. In the developed forecasting procedure, the Seasonal Adjustment (SA) method and the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) technique are synthesized as the data preprocessing component; the Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA) optimization method and the Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) algorithm construct the prediction engine. The proposed hybrid approach is verified with electricity price data sampled from the power market of New South Wales in Australia. The simulation outcome manifests that the proposed hybrid approach obtains the observable improvement in the forecasting accuracy compared with other approaches, which suggests that the proposed combinational approach occupies preferable predication ability and enough precision. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.";"Electricity price; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Forecasting; Least square support vector machine; Seasonal adjustment";"Commerce; Costs; Engines; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Simulated annealing; Support vector machines; Competitive electricity markets; Electricity prices; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decompositions (EEMD); Forecasting procedures; Least square support vector machines; Least square support vector regressions; Seasonal adjustments; Power markets";4;1;1;1
Andrade J.R., Filipe J., Reis M., Bessa R.J.;Probabilistic price forecasting for day-ahead and intraday markets: Beyond the statistical model;2017;Sustainability (Switzerland);20;Forecasting the hourly spot price of day-ahead and intraday markets is particularly challenging in electric power systems characterized by high installed capacity of renewable energy technologies. In particular, periods with low and high price levels are difficult to predict due to a limited number of representative cases in the historical dataset, which leads to forecast bias problems and wide forecast intervals. Moreover, these markets also require the inclusion of multiple explanatory variables, which increases the complexity of the model without guaranteeing a forecasting skill improvement. This paper explores information from daily futures contract trading and forecast of the daily average spot price to correct point and probabilistic forecasting bias. It also shows that an adequate choice of explanatory variables and use of simple models like linear quantile regression can lead to highly accurate spot price point and probabilistic forecasts. In terms of point forecast, the mean absolute error was 3.03 €/MWh for day-ahead market and a maximum value of 2.53 €/MWh was obtained for intraday session 6. The probabilistic forecast results show sharp forecast intervals and deviations from perfect calibration below 7% for all market sessions. © 2017 by the authors.;"Electricity market; Feature engineering; Intraday; Price forecasting; Statistical learning; Uncertainty";"complexity; electrical power; energy market; energy resource; market conditions; numerical model; price dynamics; renewable resource; statistical analysis; uncertainty analysis";4;1;1, 2;2

Pircalabu A., Benth F.E.;A regime-switching copula approach to modeling day-ahead prices in coupled electricity markets;2017;Energy Economics;10;The recent price coupling of many European electricity markets has triggered a fundamental change in the interaction of day-ahead prices, challenging additionally the modeling of the joint behavior of prices in interconnected markets. In this paper we propose a regime-switching AR–GARCH copula to model pairs of day-ahead electricity prices in coupled European markets. While capturing key stylized facts empirically substantiated in the literature, this model easily allows us to 1) deviate from the assumption of normal margins and 2) include a more detailed description of the dependence between prices. We base our empirical study on four pairs of prices, namely Germany–France, Germany–Netherlands, Netherlands–Belgium and Germany–Western Denmark. We find that the marginal dynamics are better described by the flexible skew t distribution than the benchmark normal distribution. Also, we find significant evidence of tail dependence in all pairs of interconnected areas we consider. As a first application of the proposed model, we consider the pricing of financial transmission rights, and highlight how the choice of marginal distributions and copula impacts prices. As a second application we consider the forecasting of tail quantiles, and evaluate the out-of-sample performance of competing models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;"Copula models; Day-ahead electricity prices; Financial transmission rights; Market coupling; Tail dependence; Tail quantile forecasting";"Commerce; Costs; Normal distribution; Copula models; Electricity prices; Financial transmission right; Market coupling; Tail dependence; Power markets; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; modeling; performance assessment; price dynamics; Belgium; Denmark; France; Germany; Netherlands";3, 4;1;1;1
Guo W., Zhao Z.;A novel hybrid BND-FOA-LSSVM model for electricity price forecasting;2017;Information (Switzerland);6;Accurate electricity price forecasting plays an important role in the profits of electricity market participants and the healthy development of electricity market. However, the electricity price time series hold the characteristics of volatility and randomness, which make it quite hard to forecast electricity price accurately. In this paper, a novel hybrid model for electricity price forecasting was proposed combining Beveridge-Nelson decomposition (BND) method, fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) model, namely BND-FOA-LSSVM model. Firstly, the original electricity price time series were decomposed into deterministic term, periodic term, and stochastic term by using BND model. Then, these three decomposed terms were forecasted by employing LSSVM model, respectively. Meanwhile, to improve the forecasting performance, a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm FOA was used to automatically determine the optimal parameters of LSSVM model for deterministic term forecasting, periodic term forecasting, and stochastic term forecasting. Finally, the forecasting result of electricity price can be obtained by multiplying the forecasting values of these three terms. The results show the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the proposed BND-FOA-LSSVM model are respectively 3.48%, 11.18 Yuan/MWh and 9.95 Yuan/MWh, which are much smaller than that of LSSVM, BND-LSSVM, FOA-LSSVM, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-FOA-LSSVM models. The proposed BND-FOA-LSSVM model is effective and practical for electricity price forecasting, which can improve the electricity price forecasting accuracy. © 2017 by the authors.;"Beveridge-Nelson decomposition method (BND); Electricity price forecasting; Fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA); Intelligence forecasting; Least square support vectormachine (LSSVM)";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Errors; Forecasting; Fruits; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Optimization; Signal processing; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Time series; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Decomposition methods; Electricity price forecasting; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA); Least square support vector machines; Mean absolute percentage error; Swarm intelligence optimization algorithm; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1
Lahmiri S.;Comparing variational and empirical mode decomposition in forecasting day-ahead energy prices;2017;IEEE Systems Journal;58;Recently, variational mode decomposition (VMD) has been proposed as an advanced multiresolution technique for signal processing. This study presents a VMD-based generalized regression neural network ensemble learning model to predict California electricity and Brent crude oil prices. Its performance is compared to that of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based generalized regression neural network (GRNN) ensemble model. Particle swarm optimization is used to optimize each GRNN initial weight within the ensemble system. Experimental results showed that the VMD-based ensemble outperformed EMD-based ensemble forecasting system in terms of mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean-squared error. It also outperformed the conventional auto-regressive moving average model used for comparison purpose. As a result, the VMD-based GRNN ensemble forecasting paradigm could be a promising methodology for California electricity and Brent crude oil price prediction. © 2007-2012 IEEE.;"Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); energy price; ensemble system; forecasting; generalized regression neural network; variational mode decomposition (VMD)";"Costs; Crude oil; Errors; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Regression analysis; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Energy prices; Ensemble systems; Generalized regression neural networks; Mode decomposition; Signal processing";4, 5;1;1;1
Afkhami M., Cormack L., Ghoddusi H.;Google search keywords that best predict energy price volatility;2017;Energy Economics;20;Internet search activity data has been widely used as an instrument to approximate trader attention in different markets. This method has proven effective in predicting market indices in the short-term. However, little attention has been paid to demonstrating search activity for keywords that best grab investor attention in different markets. This study attempts to build the best practically possible proxy for attention in the market for energy commodities using Google search data. Specifically, we confirm the utility of Google search activity for energy related keywords are significant predictors of volatility by showing they have incremental predictive power beyond the conventional GARCH models in predicting volatility for energy commodities' prices. Starting with a set of ninety terms used in the energy sector, the study uses a multistage filtering process to create combinations of keywords that best predict the volatility of crude oil (Brent and West Texas Intermediate), conventional gasoline (New York Harbor and US Gulf Coast), heating oil (New York Harbor), and natural gas prices. For each commodity, combinations that enhance GARCH most effectively are established as proxies of attention. The results indicate investor attention is widely reflected in Internet search activities and demonstrate search data for what keywords best reveal the direction of concern and attention in energy markets. © 2017;"Energy market; Energy price volatility; Google search activity; Volatility prediction";"Commerce; Costs; Crude oil; Filtration; Forecasting; Information retrieval; Investments; Natural gas; Power markets; Conventional gasoline; Energy markets; Energy price volatilities; Internet searches; Multistage filtering; Natural gas price; Search activity; West texas intermediates; Search engines";4;1;−1;1
Saâdaoui F., Mrad M.;Stochastic modelling of the price-volume relationship in electricity markets: Evidence from the Nordic energy exchange;2017;International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems;1;The analysis of the interactions between price and transaction volume, conducted as part of a financial market, is one of the central themes of the financial theory. However, with the emergence of power exchanges and despite the expansion of the research sphere in this context, this issue had not been sufficiently addressed. This is due to not only the lack of concepts in theory but also to the peculiarity of price dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the nature of the relationship between price changes and trading volume in the Nordic power market (Nord Pool), which is one of the largest energy markets worldwide. Through statistical timing analysis of the price-volume covariation, we reconsider this joint modelling, but only settling for daily observations, which makes the specificity of this work. Contrary to most comparable works, which were based on high frequency data, we chose to omit intraday observations to circumvent the repercussion of the daily seasonality on one side and ensure more lucidity and clairvoyance to a wider horizon on the other. The empirical results go in line with our expectations and provide support for the claim that there exists a significant reciprocal causality between prices and trading volume.

Mori H., Itaba S.;Integration of improved GRBFN with fuzzy clustering for electricity price forecasting;2017;IFSA-SCIS 2017 - Joint 17th World Congress of International Fuzzy Systems Association and 9th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems;1;"This paper proposes an efficient model with a hybrid intelligent system that consists of fuzzy c-Varieties of fuzzy clustering and GRBFN (Generalized Radial Basis Function Network) of ANN (Artificial Neural Network) for electricity price forecasting. In recent years, electric power system deregulation has been spread in the world so that electricity power markets become more complicated. Due to the highly nonlinearity of electricity price time-series, more accurate forecasting model are required to purchase and/or sell electricity in power markets. In this paper, a hybrid intelligent method is proposed to provide one-step ahead predicted values of electricity price with a couple of strategies; Fuzzy c-Varieties and improved GRBFN. The former is used to classify input data into some fuzzy clusters while the latter is employed to provide the predicted electricity price at each cluster by applying Deterministic Annealing clustering to the determination of the initial values of parameters in the Gaussian functions. The reason why Fuzzy c-Varieties are used is to increases the number of data by allowing each data to be belonged to more than two clusters. The proposed method is tested for real data of ISO New England, USA. © 2017 IEEE.";"clustering; DAclustering; electricity price; forecasting model; fuzzy c-Varieties; GRBFN; neural network; power market; pre-filtering";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Intelligent computing; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Soft computing; clustering; DAclustering; Electricity prices; Forecasting modeling; Fuzzy c-varieties; GRBFN; Pre-filtering; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Alshejari A., Kodogiannis V.S.;Electricity price forecasting using asymmetric fuzzy neural network systems;2017;IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems;5;Electricity price forecasting is considered as an important tool for energy-related utilities and power generation industries. The deregulation of power market, as well as the competitive financial environment, which have introduced new market players in this field, makes the electricity price forecasting problem a demanding mission. The main focus of this paper is to investigate the performance of asymmetric neuro-fuzzy network models for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. The proposed model has been developed from existing Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy systems by substituting the IF part of fuzzy rules with an asymmetric Gaussian function. In addition, a clustering method is utilised as a pre-processing scheme to identify the initial set and adequate number of clusters and eventually the number of rules in the proposed model. The results corresponding to the minimum and maximum electricity price have indicated that the proposed forecasting scheme could be considered as an improved tool for the forecasting accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.;"Clustering; Electricity price forecasting; Neural networks; Neurofuzzy systems; Prediction";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Clustering; Electricity price forecasting; Financial environments; Forecasting accuracy; Fuzzy neural network systems; Neurofuzzy system; Power generation industries; Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Nowakowska L., Lis K.;Electricity price forecasting as optimization problem using discrete dynamic model;2017;2017 6th International Youth Conference on Energy, IYCE 2017;3;Deregulation of wholesale energy markets has brought many challenges and one of them is the accuracy of price forecasting methods. In the environment where price is set not only by matching supply (generation side) and demand (utilities and customer side) but is also influenced by various factors such as capacity, ancillary services and transmission congestion, the most popular forecasting tools are performing poorly. Developing the proper pricing strategies is becoming increasingly important to all market participants in the competitive electric power markets. The goal of this paper is to present a price - forecasting method which uses optimized set of parameters to predict the price for the next hour. The model consists of an objective function describing the minimum difference between real price for current hour and forecasted price for the same hour. It is constrained by four equations describing current demand, supply, price and also its forecasted values. The whole system comprised of dynamic discrete model of which fundamentals are described by the author in the previous paper. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated with real data from the Californian ISO day-ahead energy market. The proposed method provides significant innovation in area of price - forecasting tools and is characterized as new approach compared to most popular techniques applied to energy markets. © 2017 IEEE.;"Day-ahead electricity market; Dynamic discrete model; Optimization; Price forecasting";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Optimization; Day-ahead electricity market; Day-ahead energy markets; Discrete dynamic models; Discrete modeling; Electricity price forecasting; Price forecasting; Transmission congestion; Wholesale energy market; Power markets";2, 4;1;1;1
Mirakyan A., Meyer-Renschhausen M., Koch A.;Composite forecasting approach, application for next-day electricity price forecasting;2017;Energy Economics;22;Accurate forecasting of electricity prices can provide significant benefits to energy suppliers when allocating their assets and to energy consumers for defining an optimal portfolio. There are numerous methods that efficiently support the forecasting of time series, such as electricity prices, which have high volatility. However, the performance of these approaches varies depending on data sets and operational conditions. In this work, the concept of composite forecasting is presented and implemented in a retrospective study, in real industrial forecasting conditions to show the potential of forecast performance improvement and comparable high consistency of a forecast performance across different ‘Day Peak’ and ‘Day Base’ electricity price data sets for different seasons. As individual methods support vector regression, artificial neural networks and ridge regression are implemented. The forecast performances of these methods are evaluated and compared with their forecast combination using different error measures. The results show that composite forecasting processes with ‘inverse root mean squared error’ combination approach can generate, on average, a more accurate and robust forecast than using an individual methods or other combination schemas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;"Combined forecast; Computational intelligence; Energy; Forecasting; Modelling";"Artificial intelligence; Costs; Forecasting; Inverse problems; Models; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Combination approaches; Combined forecasts; Electricity price forecasting; Energy; Industrial forecasting; Operational conditions; Root mean squared errors; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets; data set; electricity supply; energy use; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; price dynamics; regression analysis";5;0;1;0
Peter S.E., Raglend I.J.;Sequential wavelet-ANN with embedded ANN-PSO hybrid electricity price forecasting model for Indian energy exchange;2017;Neural Computing and Applications;8;This research paper presents a novel sequential wavelet-artificial neural network (ANN) with embedded ANN-particle swarm optimization (PSO) for short-term day-ahead forecasting of market clearing price (MCP) in the Indian energy exchange. A precise price forecasting helps suppliers to set up bidding strategies, make investment decisions and be cautious against risks. Conversely, consumers can use price forecasting to exploit appropriate power purchasing strategies for maximum utility utilization. Here the most influential historical data, namely purchase bid and MCP, are considered for training the feed-forward back-propagation neural network. The proposed model involves three sequential phases. Initially, the raw historical data are smoothened by removing the high-frequency components using a wavelet transform method which may enable better training of neural network. Then, ANN is used to train historical patterns. More number of trials is carried out, and the final weights that give the least training error are stored. In the final phase, the stored weights that are obtained from various trials are used as the initial population for the embedded ANN-PSO model. Here the performance of the proposed forecasting model is carried out using three error indices, namely mean absolute percentage error, normalized mean square error and error variance. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.;"Artificial neural networks; Mean absolute percentage error; Particle swarm optimization; Wavelet transform";"Backpropagation; Costs; Errors; Forecasting; Investments; Mean square error; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Wavelet transforms; Electricity price forecasting; Feed-forward back-propagation neural networks; Forecasting modeling; High frequency components; Investment decisions; Market clearing prices; Mean absolute percentage error; Normalized mean square error; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1
Li P., Arci F., Reilly J., Curran K., Belatreche A., Shynkevich Y.;Predicting short-term wholesale prices on the Irish single electricity market with artificial neural networks;2017;2017 28th Irish Signals and Systems Conference, ISSC 2017;3;The ability to operate effectively on electricity spot markets relies on the capability to devise appropriate bidding strategies. These in turn can benefit from the inclusion of a reliable forecast of short term system marginal prices (SMPs). In a market with an increasing percentage of renewable generators, reliable forecasts must necessarily consider additional factors such as meteorological forecasts, forecasted demand and constraints imposed by network topology. Traditional time series forecasting algorithms (e.g. based on AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models) can perform reasonably well in this context but rely on assumptions being made on behavior over different temporal windows to yield consistent results. Research studies have demonstrated that an adaptive or self-adaptive approach to forecasting would appear more suited to the task of predicting energy demands in territory such as Ireland. Implementing an in-house self-adaptive model should yield good results in the dynamic uncertain Irish energy market. We have identified the features that such a model demands and outline it here. © 2017 IEEE.;;"Commerce; Forecasting; Neural networks; Shape memory effect; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Electricity spot market; Renewable generators; Self adaptive approach; Self-adaptive models; System marginal price; Time series forecasting; Whole sale prices; Power markets";5;1;1;1
De Marcos R.A., Bello A., Reneses J.;Short-term forecasting of electricity prices with a computationally efficient hybrid approach;2017;International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM;1;Electricity price forecasting models are of great importance for market participants due to their considerable volatility, especially in deregulated and competitive contexts. As a result, these models are highly demanded, especially in day-today applications, which require not only accurate results, but also fast responsiveness. Taking these needs into account, this work proposes a novel short-term electricity forecasting approach by means of a hybrid model, combining econometric and fundamental methods.

Ziel F.;Modeling the impact of wind and solar power forecasting errors on intraday electricity prices;2017;International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM;15;We present a regression based model for intraday electricity spot prices to analyze the impact of renewable energy forecasting errors. The proposed time series model is suitable to quantify the impact of wind and solar forecasting errors. Due to the considered threshold specification assymetric dependency structures can be captured as well. Additionally it describes well the autoregressive and seasonal effects of intraday electricity prices such as the relationship to day-ahead electricity prices. The methodology is applied to the German intraday market and includes the dependence of the German/Austrian EPEX and EXAA day-ahead markets. Moreover, we discuss the evidence of time-varying and asymmetric effects of wind and solar power forecasting errors. Our findings show that given the considered modeling framework there is no statistically significant evidence that positive wind or solar forecasting errors have a different impact on intraday electricity prices than negative ones. © 2017 IEEE.;;"Commerce; Costs; Errors; Forecasting; Solar energy; Asymmetric effects; Dependency structures; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Regression-based model; Renewable energies; Time series modeling; Wind and solar power; Power markets";4;1;1;0
Wang L., Zhang Z., Chen J.;Short-Term Electricity Price Forecasting with Stacked Denoising Autoencoders;2017;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;58;A short-term forecasting of the electricity price with data-driven algorithms is studied in this research. A stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA) model, a class of deep neural networks, and its extended version are utilized to forecast the electricity price hourly. Data collected in Nebraska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Indiana hubs in U.S. are utilized. Two types of forecasting, the online hourly forecasting and day-ahead hourly forecasting, are examined. In online forecasting, SDA models are compared with data-driven approaches including the classical neural networks, support vector machine, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. In the day-ahead forecasting, the effectiveness of SDA models is further validated through comparing with industrial results and a recently reported method. Computational results demonstrate that SDA models are capable to accurately forecast electricity prices and the extended SDA model further improves the forecasting performance. © 2016 IEEE.;"Comparative analysis; data mining; electricity price; hourly forecasting; neural networks";"Costs; Data mining; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Neural networks; Power markets; Classical neural networks; Comparative analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting performance; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Short-term forecasting; Forecasting";5;1;1;1
Tahmasebifar R., Sheikh-El-Eslami M.K., Kheirollahi R.;Point and interval forecasting of real-time and day-ahead electricity prices by a novel hybrid approach;2017;IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution;24;Accurate forecasting of electricity market prices presents important information to market participants. This provides forward planning of their bidding strategies in order to maximise revenue, profit, and utility perspectives. Nevertheless, due to the non-stationarities involved in market clearing price, an accurate forecasting of these prices is very complex. In this case, transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval ones is of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts. In this study, interval forecasting of market clearing prices is conducted based on a novel approach within two consecutive steps. In the first step, a new hybrid method is proposed to estimate point forecasts: combination of wavelet transformation (Wt), feature selection based on Mutual Information (MI), extreme learning machine (ELM), and bootstrap approaches in an ensemble structure is employed. The second step consists of the following stepwise parts: calculating the variance of the model uncertainties based on the extracted data from the ensemble structure, estimating the noise variance by using the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), and improving the accuracy of interval forecasting by using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach termed as Wt-mutual information-ELM-MLE-PSO is validated through electricity market real data of Australian electricity network from real-time and day-ahead market viewpoints. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.;;"Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Electric industry; Learning algorithms; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Uncertainty analysis; Australian electricities; Extreme learning machine; Interval forecasting; Market Clearing Price; Model uncertainties; Mutual informations; Particle swarm optimisation; Wavelet transformations; Forecasting";5;1;1;2

Day-ahead prediction provides forecast prices for a day ahead that is useful for daily operation and decision-making. The main challenge for day ahead price forecasting is the accuracy and efficiency. Lower accuracy is produced due to the nature of electricity price that is highly volatile compared to load series. Hence, some researchers have developed complex procedures to produce accurate forecast while considering significant features and optimum parameters. Therefore, a multistage optimization for hybrid Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model is developed in this study to provide an accurate price forecast with optimized parameters and input features. So far, no literature has been found on multistage feature and parameter selections using the methods of LSSVM-GA for day-ahead price prediction. All the models are examined on the Ontario power market; which is reported as among the most volatile market worldwide. A huge number of features are selected by two stages of optimization to avoid from missing any important features. The developed LSSVM-GA shows higher forecast accuracy with lower complexity than the existing models. © 2016 IEEE.";"Accuracy; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Support vector machines";"Commerce; Costs; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Support vector machines; Accuracy; Electrical power system; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Least square support vector machines; Multi-stage optimization; Optimized parameter; Parameter selection; Power markets";5;2;1;1
Gupta S., Chitkara P.;Day ahead price forecasting models in thin electricity market;2017;2017 IEEE Power and Energy Conference at Illinois, PECI 2017;2;Day Ahead Electricity Markets (DAMs) in India are thin but growing. Consistent price forecasts are important for their utilization in portfolio optimization models. Univariate or multivariate models with standard exogenous variables such as special day effects etc. are not always useful. Drivers of demand and supply include weather variations over large geographic areas, outages of power system elements and sudden changes in contracts which lead the players to access power exchanges. These needs to be considered in forecasting models. Such models are observed to considerably reduce forecasting errors by outperforming other models under conditions, which are neither infrequent nor recur at defined intervals. This paper develops models for India and tests the utility of these models using Model Confidence Set (MCS) approach which picks up the 'best' models. The approach has been developed for a power utility in India over a period of two years in live business environment. © 2017 IEEE.;"Day ahead price forecasting; Electricity market; IEX; MCS; thin electricity market";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Optimization; Business environments; Day-ahead electricity market; Day-ahead prices; Exogenous variables; Forecasting error; Forecasting models; Multivariate models; Portfolio optimization models; Power markets";4;1;1;1
Kiesel R., Paraschiv F.;Econometric analysis of 15-minute intraday electricity prices;2017;Energy Economics;56;The trading activity in the German intraday electricity market has increased significantly over the last years. This is partially due to an increasing share of renewable energy, wind and photovoltaic, which requires power generators to balance out the forecasting errors in their production. We investigate the bidding behaviour in the intraday market by looking at both last prices and continuous bidding, in the context of a reduced-form econometric analysis. A unique data set of 15-minute intraday prices and intraday-updated forecasts of wind and photovoltaic has been employed. Price bids are explained by prior information on renewables forecasts and demand/supply market-specific exogenous variables. We show that intraday prices adjust asymmetrically to both forecasting errors in renewables and to the volume of trades dependent on the threshold variable demand quote, which reflects the expected demand covered by the planned traditional capacity in the day-ahead market. The location of the threshold can be used by market participants to adjust their bids accordingly, given the latest updates in the wind and photovoltaic forecasting errors and the forecasts of the control area balances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;"Bidding behavior; Intraday electricity prices; Renewable energies";"Commerce; Costs; Errors; Bidding behavior; Demand/supply market; Econometric analysis; Electricity prices; Exogenous variables; Market participants; Prior information; Renewable energies; Forecasting; alternative energy; econometrics; electricity supply; photovoltaic system; price determination; wind power; Germany";3;1;2;1
Shao Z., Yang S., Gao F., Zhou K., Lin P.;A new electricity price prediction strategy using mutual information-based SVM-RFE classification;2017;Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews;21;Owing to the central role in electricity market operation, researchers have long sought to investigate the price responsiveness of both electricity supply and consumption sides. From the perspective of demand-side management (DSM), electricity prices prediction can be regarded as a pattern recognition problem of classifying future electricity prices with respect to a predefined threshold. From a fresh perspective this paper develops an efficient framework, called TSS-RFE-MRMR based SVM (Time series segmentation, recursive feature elimination, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance based support vector machine), for providing estimates of price fluctuation over certain valuation domains and modeling high-dimensional electricity market price without adopting additional impact factors. It starts from adopting a novel feature space determination scheme, called principal component analysis-dynamic programming (PCA-DP) based time series segmentation. Then, the RFE-MRMR filter for significant features selection is implemented, where both redundant and less relevant features are progressively eliminated among the potential feature sets. To test the performance of the proposed approach, it is evaluated on Ontario and New York electricity markets and compared with other method. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other traditional method and present a relatively higher prediction accuracy on the electricity price. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd;"Electricity market price prediction; Minimum redundancy maximum relevancy; Pattern classification; SVM-RFE; Time series segmentation";"Classification (of information); Commerce; Dynamic programming; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Pattern recognition; Power markets; Principal component analysis; Redundancy; Support vector machines; Time series; Time series analysis; Electricity market operations; Market price; Minimum redundancy maximum relevancy; Minimum redundancy-maximum relevances; Pattern recognition problems; Recursive feature elimination; SVM-RFE; Time-series segmentation; Costs";5;1;1;2
Saâdaoui F.;A seasonal feedforward neural network to forecast electricity prices;2017;Neural Computing and Applications;15;In power industry and management, given the peculiarity and high complexity of the time series, it is highly requested to make models more flexible and well adapted to the data, in order to give them the ability to capture and recognize the most complex patterns, and consequently gain more accuracy in forecasting. To fulfill this aim, we define the seasonal autoregressive neural network (SAR-NN) as a dynamic feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), essentially conceived to forecast electricity prices. The SAR-NN is an ANN-based autoregressive model that considers that autoregressors are only those that are lagged by a multiple of the period p of the dominating seasonality. Moving forward this neural network, step-by-step, allows to generate multiple-steps-ahead reliable forecasts. This model is specifically designed to robustly overcome the strong seasonal effects and the other nonlinear patterns that often harm ANNs forecasting performance. The strategy is tested and compared to a number of homologous models throughout empirical experiments. As a case study, we focus on the Nord Pool Scandinavian power market, which is one of the most mature energy markets worldwide. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.;"Artificial neural networks; Electricity spot prices; Forecasting; Nord Pool market; Seasonal autoregressive models";"Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Auto regressive models; Autoregressive neural networks; Dynamic feedforward; Electricity spot price; Empirical experiments; Forecasting performance; Pool markets; Seasonal autoregressive models; Electric network parameters";4, 5;1;1;1
Bennedsen M.;A rough multi-factor model of electricity spot prices;2017;Energy Economics;7;We introduce a new continuous-time mathematical model of electricity spot prices which accounts for the most important stylized facts of these time series: seasonality, spikes, stochastic volatility, and mean reversion. Empirical studies have found a possible fifth stylized fact, roughness, and our approach explicitly incorporates this into the model of the prices. Our setup generalizes the popular Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-based multi-factor framework of Benth et al. (2007) and allows us to perform statistical tests to distinguish between an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-based model and a rough model. Further, through the multi-factor approach we account for seasonality and spikes before estimating – and making inference on – the degree of roughness. This is novel in the literature and we present simulation evidence showing that these precautions are crucial for accurate estimation. Lastly, we estimate our model on recent data from six European energy exchanges and find statistical evidence of roughness in five out of six markets. As an application of our model, we show how, in these five markets, a rough component improves short term forecasting of the prices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;"Electricity prices; Energy markets; Forecasting; Fractals; Mean reversion; Multi-factor modeling; Roughness";"Commerce; Continuous time systems; Costs; Estimation; Forecasting; Fractals; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Surface roughness; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Energy markets; European energy exchanges; Mean reversion; Multi factors; Short-term forecasting; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic models; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; fractal analysis; numerical model; price determination; Europe";4;1;1;1
Varshney H., Sharma A., Kumar R.;A hybrid approach to price forecasting incorporating exogenous variables for a day ahead electricity Market;2017;1st IEEE International Conference on Power Electronics, Intelligent Control and Energy Systems, ICPEICES 2016;7;Predicting Location Based Market Price (LBMP) in real time is an important and complex task that involves a great accuracy to model extreme spikes. Occurrence of spikes in real time LBMP is due to uncertainty in load demand as well as a significant variation in surrounding temperature throughout the day. These fluctuations cause extreme spikes in market clearing price due to transmission outages, shortage of supply and consumption of costly generation reserves. Therefore, the market participants are forced to purchase the electricity at very high price but the regulation set on the price cap by market authorities results into an economic loss to retailers and market participants. Accordingly, accurate forecasting of price is an important exercise to hedge against volatility. This paper proposes a hybrid technique comprising singular spectrum analysis and neural network incorporating temperature and load data for forecasting in day ahead electricity market. The results obtained with this hybrid technique are found to be more accurate when compared to existing methods described in literature. © 2016 IEEE.;"Electricity price forecasting; neural network; real time forecast; singular spectrum analysis";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Intelligent control; Losses; Neural networks; Plasma diagnostics; Power control; Power electronics; Spectrum analysis; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Exogenous variables; Market Clearing Price; Market participants; Real-time forecasts; Singular spectrum analysis; Surrounding temperature; Power markets";4, 5;0;1;0

Due to the sensitivity of forecasting issues in market's performance, and high prediction error resulted from the behavior of price series, nowadays probabilistic forecasting highly attracted participants' attention. In this paper, a probabilistic approach for the hourly electricity price forecasting is presented. In the proposed method, the uncertainty of predictor model is considered as the uncertainty factor. The bootstrapping technique is used to implement the uncertainty and since the method is needed to be fast and of low computational cost in the daily forecasting, a generalized learning method is applied, which has high accuracy and speed. This newly presented learning method is based on generalized extreme learning machine approach to be used for improved wavelet neural networks. Also in order to reach more accommodation, the predictor model with the changes of price time series, the wavelet preprocessing is used.

These forecasting tools are developed based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). A series of historical price data of the TEM are utilized to model and optimize the ANN structure and to develop the ANN-based price forecasting tool.

Pan K., Shi W., Wang X., Li J.;A short-term marginal price forecasting model based on ensemble learning;2017;Proceedings of 2017 International Conference on Progress in Informatics and Computing, PIC 2017;1;This The system marginal price reflects the short-term supply and demand of electricity goods in the electricity market, which is an important economic link to the participating members of the market. The traditional prediction model has a large error and low generalization ability to forecast the short-term marginal price. Therefore, this paper proposes an ensemble learning algorithm for short-term marginal price forecasting based on AdaBoost. In this paper, the main factors influencing the short-term marginal electricity price are analyzed. Based on the AdaBoost algorithm, the short-term marginal electricity price forecasting problem is modeled. Four prediction models (C4.5, CART, Linear neural network, BP) are compared, and a short - term marginal price forecasting algorithm is proposed. By comparing the actual values with the predicted values, our proposed algorithm is superior to SVM and BP algorithm, which has high application values in power plant engineering. © 2017 IEEE.;"AdaBoost; Integrated learning; Short term; System marginal price";"Adaptive boosting; Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Photonic integration technology; Ensemble learning algorithm; Generalization ability; High application value; Integrated learning; Marginal electricities; Short term; Short-term marginal prices; System marginal price; Power markets";5;1;0;0
Nair I., Robert A.;A chaotic model approach for electricity price forecasting in Indian scenario;2017;;;In a deregulated power market, the electricity prices exhibit extreme volatility due to its non-storable nature, supply constraints at peak hours, transmission line congestion at peak hours and seasonal and diurnal variations. The objective of this paper is to model the day-ahead market price of Indian energy exchange (IEX) based on time series modelling approach. The detailed analysis of market clearing price (MCP) collected from IEX clearly indicates the chaotic nature of data. It is because of this chaotic behaviour, the phase space of the time series data is reconstructed using Taken's theorem. With the concept of the add-weighted one-rank multi-step model, the MCP of IEX is modelled as a chaotic model from this reconstructed phase space. Furthermore, the developed chaotic model is verified for forecasting MCP and the simulation results demonstrate that the chaotic model developed outperforms the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model in terms of in sample forecasting performances.

Itaba S., Mori H.;A Fuzzy-Preconditioned GRBFN Model for Electricity Price Forecasting;2017;Procedia Computer Science;5;This paper proposes a fuzzy-preconditioned ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model for electricity price forecasting. The deregulated electric power systems have been widely spread to trade electric power through electric power markets. The market players are interested in gaining the inside track to maximize the profits and minimize risks in advance. One of the most important tasks is how to forecast a complicated time series of electricity price that affects transmission network congestion. In practice, it is hard to forecast electricity price with the spikes due to the high nonlinearity. In this paper, GRBFN (General Radial Basis Function Network) of ANN is proposed for electricity price forecasting. It is an extension of RBFN of ANN in a way that the optimal parameters of the Gaussian functions are determined by the learning process in RBFN. To improve the model accuracy of GRBFN, FCE (fuzzy c-Elliptotypes) is introduced into GRBFN as a fuzzy precondition technique. FCE is an extension of FCM (fuzzy c-means) and plays a key role to classify input data into fuzzy clusters. The use of FCE contributes to the improvement of model accuracy for spikes of electricity price that bring about much higher price. This paper makes use of DA clustering to evaluate a better initial solution of the parameters of the Gaussian functions. Also, EPSO of evolutionary computation is used to evaluate better weights between neurons. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of electricity price. © 2017 The Author(s).;"artificial neural network; DA clustering; electricity price; EPSO; evolutionary computation; fuzzy c-Elliptotypes; fuzzy clustering; global clustering; GRBFN; power markets; RBFN; spikes; time-series forecasting";"Adaptive systems; Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Deregulation; Electric power systems; Embedded systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Function evaluation; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy inference; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Time series; DA clustering; Electricity prices; EPSO; fuzzy c-Elliptotypes; Global clustering; GRBFN; RBFN; spikes; Time series forecasting; Power markets";5;0;0;0
Smolen J., Dudic B.;The role of residual demand in electricity price analysis and forecasting: Case of Czech electricity market;2017;International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy;6;Most of scientific papers dealing with power price predictions base their work on various statistical time series models. In this paper we propose a new, purely fundamental, approach to the issues of electricity price analysis and forecasting. While precise replication of real power market processes is very complicated, we show that even relatively simple fundamental model is able to explain large part of price movements on the electricity markets. Analysis presented is based predominantly on the merit order theory and introduces the concept of residual demand as a crucial variable for explaining hourly electricity price movements. While the analysis shown in this paper is applied to the Czech Electricity day-ahead market, it can be well replicated also for the other relevant European power market areas. Tests of fundamental approaches towards power price forecasting have shown very promising results and we believe they deserve more attention from the electricity market researchers. © 2017, Econjournals.

Razak I.A.W.A., Abidin I.Z., Siah Y.K., Abidin A.A.Z., Rahman T.K.A.;Short term electricity price forecasting with multistage optimization technique of LSSVM-GA;2017;Journal of Telecommunication, Electronic and Computer Engineering;;"Price prediction has now become an important task in the operation of electrical power system. In short term forecast, electricity price can be predicted for an hour-ahead or day-ahead. An hour-ahead prediction offers the market members with the pre-dispatch prices for the next hour. It is useful for an effective bidding strategy where the quantity of bids can be revised or changed prior to the dispatch hour. However, only a few studies have been conducted in the field of hour-ahead forecasting. This is due to most of the power markets apply two-settlement market structure (day-ahead and real time) or standard market design rather than single-settlement system (real time). Therefore, a multistage optimization for hybrid Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model is developed in this study to provide an accurate price forecast with optimized parameters and input features. So far, no literature has been found on multistage feature and parameter selections using the methods of LSSVM-GA for hour-ahead price prediction. All the models are examined on the Ontario power market; which is reported as among the most volatile market worldwide. A huge number of features are selected by three stages of optimization to avoid from missing any important features. The developed LSSVM-GA shows higher forecast accuracy with lower complexity than the existing models.";"Genetic Algorithms; Hour-Ahead Forecasting; Multistage Optimization; Support Vector Machines";;5;1;2;1
Wolff G., Feuerriegel S.;Short-term dynamics of day-ahead and intraday electricity prices;2017;International Journal of Energy Sector Management;6;Purpose: Since the liberalization of electricity markets in the European Union, prices are subject to market dynamics. Hence, understanding the short-term drivers of electricity prices is of major interest to electricity companies and policymakers. Accordingly, this paper aims to study movements of prices in the combined German and Austrian electricity market. Design/methodology/approach: This paper estimates an autoregressive model with exogenous variables (ARX) in a two-step procedure. In the first step, both time series, which inherently feature seasonality, are de-seasonalized, and in the second step, the influence of all model variables on the two dependent variables, i.e. the day-ahead and intraday European Power Energy Exchange prices, is measured. Findings: The results reveal that the short-term market is largely driven by seasonality, consumer demand and short-term feed-ins from renewable energy sources. As a contribution to the existing body of literature, this paper specifically compares the price movements in day-ahead and intraday markets. In intraday markets, the influences of renewable energies are much stronger than in day-ahead markets, i.e. by 24.12 per cent for wind and 116.82 per cent for solar infeeds. Originality/value: Knowledge on the price setting mechanism in the intraday market is particularly scarce. This paper contributes to existing research on this topic by deriving drivers in the intraday market and then contrasting them to the day-ahead market. A more thorough understanding is especially crucial for all stakeholders, who can use this knowledge to optimize their bidding strategies. Furthermore, the findings suggest policy implications for a more stable and efficient electricity market. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Autoregressive; Electricity; External drivers; Modelling; Pricing; Renewable energies; Time series analysis; Weather influence";"Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric industry; Electricity; Models; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive model with exogenous variable (ARX); Dependent variables; Design/methodology/approach; Electricity companies; Policy implications; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Power markets";4;1;1, 2;1
Abate G.D., Haldrup N.;Space-time modeling of electricity spot prices;2017;Energy Journal;1;Using data for the Nord Pool power grid, we derive a space-time Durbin model for electricity spot prices with both temporal and spatial lags. Joint modeling of temporal and spatial adjustment effects is necessarily important when prices and loads are determined in a network grid. By using different spatial weight matrices, statistical tests show significant spatial dependence in the spot price dynamics across areas. In fact, estimation of the model shows that the spatial dependence is as important as the temporal dependence in describing the spot price dynamics. We decompose price impacts into direct and indirect effects and demonstrate how price effects transmit to neighboring markets and decline with distance. A forecasting comparison with a non-spatial model shows that the space-time model improves forecasting performance for 7 and 30 days ahead forecasts. A model with time-varying parameters is estimated for an expanded sample period and it is found that the spatial correlation within the power grid has increased over time. We interpret this to indicate an increasing degree of market integration within the sample period. © 2017 by the IAEE.

Qiu X., Suganthan P.N., Amaratunga G.A.J.;Short-term Electricity Price Forecasting with Empirical Mode Decomposition based Ensemble Kernel Machines;2017;Procedia Computer Science;14;Short-term electricity price forecasting is a critical issue for the operation of both electricity markets and power systems. An ensemble method composed of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) is presented in this paper. For this purpose, the electricity price signal was first decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by EMD, followed by a KRR which was used to model each extracted IMF and predict the tendencies. Finally, the prediction results of all IMFs were combined by an SVR to obtain an aggregated output for electricity price. The electricity price datasets from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed EMD-KRR-SVR approach. Simulation results demonstrated attractiveness of the proposed method based on both accuracy and efficiency.;"Electricity Price Forecasting; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Ensemble Learning; Kernel Ridge Regression; Support Vector Regression";"Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Signal processing; Electricity price forecasting; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Ensemble learning; Kernel ridge regressions; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets";5;1;1;1

Beigaite R., Krilavičius T.;Electricity price forecasting for Nord Pool data;2017;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;2;Due to worldwide liberalization of power markets, electricity can be purchased and sold as any other commodity. The market spot price of electricity has features such as high volatility, seasonality and spikes. In order to minimize risks, maximize profits and make future plans, it is important for participants of electricity market to forecast future prices. The vast number of various methods is applied for solving this problem. However, the accuracy of forecasts is not sufficient, different approaches work differently with different countries (markets).

Amountzias C., Dagdeviren H., Patokos T.;Pricing decisions and market power in the uk electricity market: A VECM approach;2017;Energy Policy;11;This paper examines the influence of market power in the formation of retail and wholesale electricity prices in the UK over 1998–2012 on the basis of Vector Error Correction model (VECM). Market power is measured as the influence of the market share of the Big Six in a dynamic demand and supply VECM. The findings indicate that market power of the Big Six in the wholesale industry has a significant and large positive influence on the wholesale mark-up in the short-run. The long-run estimates support the arguments about ‘revenue rebalancing’ resulting from vertical integration. That is, low market power (and hence low revenues) in the wholesale industry leads to higher prices (hence higher revenues) in the retail industry. These findings are in contrast to the CMA's finding that no market power is exercised in the wholesale industry. Retail electricity prices are affected directly by both the wholesale and retail market concentration ratios in the long-run rather than indirectly through the wholesale mark-up. Overall, the findings in this paper provide support for the view that the UK electricity market exhibits significant anti-competitive conduct in both the retail and wholesale segments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;"Electricity; Market power; Retail; The Big Six; UK; Wholesale";"Competition; Costs; Economics; Electric industry; Electricity; Error correction; Power markets; Sales; Electricity prices; Market Power; Retail; The Big Six; Vector error correction model; Vertical integration; Wholesale; Wholesale electricity; Commerce; competition (economics); electricity; energy market; error correction; numerical model; price dynamics; retailing; vector; vertical integration; United Kingdom";4;0;1;1
Gollou A.R., Ghadimi N.;A new feature selection and hybrid forecast engine for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets;2017;Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems;95;In this paper, a new feature selection and forecast engine is presented for day ahead prediction of electricity prices, which are so valuable for both producers and consumers in the new competitive electric power markets. In a competitive electricity market, forecast of energy prices is a key information for the market participants. However, price signal usually has a complex behavior due to its nonlinearity, non-stationary, and time variance. Also, an appropriate feature selection is crucial for accurate forecasting. In this paper, a two-step approach that identifies a set of candidate features based on the data characteristics proposed and then selects a subset of them using correlation and instance-based feature selection methods, applied in a systematic way. Then, a combination of wavelet transform (WT) and a hybrid forecast method is presented based on neural network (NN) and an optimization algorithms. The proposed method is examined on PJM electricity market and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods. These comparisons illustrate effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2017-IOS Press and the authors.

Domanski P.D., Gintrowski M.;Alternative approaches to the prediction of electricity prices;2017;International Journal of Energy Sector Management;8;Purpose: This paper aims to present the results of the comparison between different approaches to the prediction of electricity prices. It is well-known that the properties of the data generation process may prefer some modeling methods over the others. The data having an origin in social or market processes are characterized by unexpectedly wide realization space resulting in the existence of the long tails in the probabilistic density function. These data may not be easy in time series prediction using standard approaches based on the normal distribution assumptions. The electricity prices on the deregulated market fall into this category. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents alternative approaches, i.e. memory-based prediction and fractal approach compared with established nonlinear method of neural networks. The appropriate interpretation of results is supported with the statistical data analysis and data conditioning. These algorithms have been applied to the problem of the energy price prediction on the deregulated electricity market with data from Polish and Austrian energy stock exchanges. Findings: The first outcome of the analysis is that there are several situations in the task of time series prediction, when standard modeling approach based on the assumption that each change is independent of the last following random Gaussian bell pattern may not be a true. In this paper, such a case was considered: price data from energy markets. Electricity prices data are biased by the human nature. It is shown that more relevant for data properties was Cauchy probabilistic distribution. Results have shown that alternative approaches may be used and prediction for both data memory-based approach resulted in the best performance. Research limitations/implications: “Personalization” of the model is crucial aspect in the whole methodology. All available knowledge should be used on the forecasted phenomenon and incorporate it into the model. In case of the memory-based modeling, it is a specific design of the history searching routine that uses the understanding of the process features. Importance should shift toward methodology structure design and algorithm customization and then to parameter estimation. Such modeling approach may be more descriptive for the user enabling understanding of the process and further iterative improvement in a continuous striving for perfection. Practical implications: Memory-based modeling can be practically applied. These models have large potential that is worth to be exploited. One disadvantage of this modeling approach is large calculation effort connected with a need of constant evaluation of large data sets. It was shown that a graphics processing unit (GPU) approach through parallel calculation on the graphical cards can improve it dramatically. Social implications: The modeling of the electricity prices has big impact of the daily operation of the electricity traders and distributors. From one side, appropriate modeling can improve performance mitigating risks associated with the process. Thus, the end users should receive higher quality of services ultimately with lower prices and minimized risk of the energy loss incidents. Originality/value: The use of the alternative approaches, such as memory-based reasoning or fractals, is very rare in the field of the electricity price forecasting. Thus, it gives a new impact for further research enabling development of better solutions incorporating all available process knowledge and customized hybrid algorithms. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;"Artificial intelligence; Econometric; Energy sector; Forecasting; Modelling; Neural networks; Pricing; Time series analysis";"Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Deregulation; Electronic trading; Energy dissipation; Forecasting; Fractals; Graphics processing unit; Iterative methods; Models; Neural networks; Normal distribution; Power markets; Probability distributions; Program processors; Time series analysis; Deregulated electricity market; Design/methodology/approach; Econometric; Electricity price forecasting; Energy sector; Probabilistic density function; Probabilistic distribution; Statistical data analysis; Costs";5;1;1;1
Singh N., Mohanty S.R., Dev Shukla R.;Short term electricity price forecast based on environmentally adapted generalized neuron;2017;Energy;32;The liberalization of the power markets gained a remarkable momentum in the context of trading electricity as a commodity. With the upsurge in restructuring of the power markets, electricity price plays a dominant role in the current deregulated market scenario which is majorly influenced by the economics being governed. In the deregulated environment price forecasting is an important aspect for the power system planning. The problem of price forecasting can be entirely viewed as a signal processing problem with proper estimation of model parameters, modeling of uncertainties, etc. Among the different existing models the artificial neural network based models have gained wide popularity due their black box structure but it too has its own limitations. In the proposed work in order to overcome the limitations of the classical artificial neural network model, generalized neuron model is used for forecasting the short term electricity price of Australian electricity market. The pre-processing of the input parameters is accomplished using wavelet transform for better representation of the low and high frequency components. The free parameters of the generalized neuron model are tuned using environment adaptation method algorithm for increasing the generalization ability and efficacy of the model. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;"Environment adaptation method; Generalized neuron model; IEAM; Price forecasting; Wavelet transform";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Neural networks; Neurons; Parameter estimation; Signal processing; Uncertainty analysis; Wavelet transforms; Artificial neural network modeling; Australian electricity market; Environment adaptation; Generalized neuron; IEAM; Low and high frequencies; Price forecasting; Signal processing problems; Power markets; algorithm; analytical method; artificial neural network; commodity price; electricity; energy market; energy planning; forecasting method; market conditions; numerical model; price dynamics; transform; wavelet analysis; Australia";4, 5;1;1;1
Bebarta D.K., Bisoi R., Dash P.K.;Mining of electricity prices in energy markets using a hybrid linear ARMA and nonlinear functional link neural network trained by evolutionary unscented H-infinity filter;2017;International Journal of Information and Decision Sciences;;This paper presents a hybrid autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and a nonlinear functional link neural network for electricity price forecasting in an Energy market. The functional neural block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher dimensional space through a basis function without using any hidden layers like MLP structure. Unlike the conventional functional link artificial neural network (FLANN), the input layer comprises the inputs and tangent hyperbolic functions of the linear combination of the inputs known as the basis functions. The proposed hybrid neural network is trained by an unscented H-infinity filter to provide an accurate forecasting of day ahead electricity prices. The noise covariance parameters of the unscented H-infinity filter are further optimised with an adaptive differential evolution strategy. The studies on PJM, Spanish and Australian energy market markets exhibit excellent forecasting results over different seasonal horizons for one day ahead of time.

Abedinia O., Amjady N., Zareipour H.;A New Feature Selection Technique for Load and Price Forecast of Electrical Power Systems;2017;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;112;Load and price forecasts are necessary for optimal operation planning in competitive electricity markets. However, most of the load and price forecast methods suffer from lack of an efficient feature selection technique with the ability of modeling the nonlinearities and interacting features of the forecast processes. In this paper, a new feature selection method is presented. An important contribution of the proposed method is modeling interaction in addition to relevancy and redundancy, based on information-theoretic criteria, for feature selection. Another main contribution of the paper is proposing a hybrid filter-wrapper approach. The filter part selects a minimum subset of the most informative features by considering relevancy, redundancy, and interaction of the candidate inputs in a coordinated manner. The wrapper part fine-tunes the settings of the composite filter. © 1969-2012 IEEE.;"Feature selection; interaction; load forecast; price forecast; redundancy; relevancy";"Costs; Electric power systems; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Information theory; Redundancy; Competitive electricity markets; Efficient feature selections; Feature selection methods; Information theoretic criterion; interaction; Load forecast; Price forecasts; relevancy; Electric load forecasting";4, 5;1;1;1
Wang D., Luo H., Grunder O., Lin Y., Guo H.;Multi-step ahead electricity price forecasting using a hybrid model based on two-layer decomposition technique and BP neural network optimized by firefly algorithm;2017;Applied Energy;125;In the deregulated competitive electricity market, the price which reflects the relationship between electricity supply and demand is one of the most important elements, making it crucial for all market participants to precisely forecast the electricity price. However, electricity price series usually has complex features such as non-linearity, non-stationarity and volatility, which makes the price forecasting turn out to be very difficult. In order to improve the accuracy of electricity price forecasting, this paper first proposes a two-layer decomposition technique and then develops a hybrid model based on fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition (FEEMD), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and back propagation (BP) neural network optimized by firefly algorithm (FA). The proposed model is unique in the sense that VMD is specifically applied to further decompose the high frequency intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) generated by FEEMD into a number of modes in order to improve the forecast accuracy. To validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model, three electricity price series respectively collected from the real-world electricity markets of Australia and France are adopted to conduct the empirical study. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the other considered models over horizons of one-step, two-step, four-step and six-step ahead forecasting, which shows that the proposed model has superior performances for both one-step and multi-step ahead forecasting of electricity price. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd;"Back propagation neural network; Electricity price forecasting; Fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Firefly algorithm; Multi-step ahead; Variational mode decomposition";"Backpropagation algorithms; Bioluminescence; Commerce; Competition; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Optimization; Signal processing; Back propagation neural networks; Electricity price forecasting; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Firefly algorithms; Mode decomposition; Multi-step; Power markets; artificial neural network; back propagation; decomposition; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy market; numerical model; optimization; price dynamics; Australia; France";4, 5;1;1;1
Bello A., Bunn D.W., Reneses J., Munoz A.;Medium-Term Probabilistic Forecasting of Electricity Prices: A Hybrid Approach;2017;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;22;This paper provides a focus upon forecasting electricity prices in the medium term (from a few weeks to several months ahead) in which accurate estimates of tail risks, e.g., at the 1%, 5%, 95%, and 99%, are important. Medium term forecasting and risk analysis are important for operational scheduling, fuel purchasing, trading, and profit management. We extend the research on hybrid forecasting methods, which link detailed fundamental price formation models, using optimization techniques and market equilibrium considerations, with econometric recalibration to the time series data. This paper is innovative in its use of quantile regression to undertake the recalibration and provide accurate risk estimates. It is shown that probabilistic outputs from the fundamental model add value over expected value inputs to the quantile regressions and that if the fundamental model is itself well specified to diurnal variation through the inclusion of relevant explanatory variables such as demand or climatic conditions, then it is not necessary to undertake the quantile regressions separately for each hour of the day. A real application of the proposed methodology is successfully tested on the Spanish electric power system, in which the high penetration of intermittent wind generation creates extreme price risks. The hybrid method outperforms the more conventional fundamental model, making particular use of wind generation data in the quantile recalibrations. © 1969-2012 IEEE.;"Electricity prices; fundamentals; hybrid model; probabilistic forecasting; quantile regression";"Commerce; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Scheduling; Electricity prices; fundamentals; Hybrid model; Probabilistic forecasting; Quantile regression; Costs";4;2;1;2
Yang Z., Ce L., Lian L.;Electricity price forecasting by a hybrid model, combining wavelet transform, ARMA and kernel-based extreme learning machine methods;2017;Applied Energy;138;Electricity prices have rather complex features such as high volatility, high frequency, nonlinearity, mean reversion and non-stationarity that make forecasting very difficult. However, accurate electricity price forecasting is essential to market traders, retailers, and generation companies. To improve prediction accuracy using each model's unique features, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines the wavelet transform, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) based on self-adapting particle swarm optimization and an auto regressive moving average (ARMA). Self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) is adopted to search for the optimal kernel parameters of the KELM. After testing the wavelet decomposition components, stationary series as new input sets are predicted by the ARMA model and non-stationary series are predicted by the SAPSO-KELM model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using electricity price data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), Australian and Spanish markets. The experimental results show that the developed method has more accurate prediction, better generality and practicability than individual methods and other hybrid methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd;"ARMA; Electricity price forecasting; KELM; SAPSO; Wavelet transform";"Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Time series analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; ARMA; Autoregressive moving average; Decomposition components; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme learning machine; KELM; Non-stationary series; SAPSO; Power markets; accuracy assessment; electricity generation; energy market; machine learning; nonlinearity; numerical model; optimization; price dynamics; Australia; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; United States";4, 5;2;1;1

The information obtained from future electricity helps market participants to develop cost-effective bidding strategies to maximize their profit.

Yan X., Song Y., Chowdhury N.A.;Performance evaluation of single SVM and LSSVM based forecasting models using price zones analysis;2016;Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, APPEEC;3;According to the current electricity price forecasting studies, it was very difficult to conclude whether support vector machine (SVM) or least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is more suitable in solving highly non-linear regression problems with very large time horizon such as mid-term electricity market clearing price (MCP) forecasting. In this paper, a detailed evaluation process using price zones analysis technique is applied in evaluating single SVM and single LSSVM based mid-term electricity MCP forecasting models. Based on much more detailed performance evaluation results and consideration of requirements for machine learning techniques utilizing in longer time horizon and highly nonlinear questions, the proposed paper concluded that SVM is more suitable than LSSVM in mid-term electricity MCP forecasting.

Mohamed A., El-Hawary M.E.;On optimization of SVMs kernels and parameters for electricity price forecasting;2016;2016 IEEE Electrical Power and Energy Conference, EPEC 2016;1;Forecasting electricity price allows market participants to make informed and sound decisions. Selecting the best training variables is often involved in forecasting in order to obtain optimal prediction. Support Vector Regression (SVR) provides an effective method to fit data and find minimal risk slack variables around a fit line. The best fit depends on the selected input feature set and the tuning of hyper-parameters. In this paper, various SVM optimization solvers were utilized to train and optimize the SVM parameters to speed up the quadratic programming convergence and increase the forecasting accuracy. Various kernels were used with the SVM Regression model and a comparison of their performance was made. Our experiments demonstrated that the RBF Kernel is the most efficient.

Zarnikau J., Woo C.-K., Zhu S.;Zonal merit-order effects of wind generation development on day-ahead and real-time electricity market prices in Texas;2016;Journal of Energy Markets;7;This paper uses a regression-based approach to explore the impact of wind generation development on wholesale electricity prices in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market. We find that wind generation development has a greater effect on real-time market (RTM) prices than day-ahead market (DAM) prices. Higher wind generation forecast errors tend to reduce the RTMprices, chiefly because unanticipated increases in wind generation reduce the real-time net loads to be served by fossil fuel power plants. Improving ERCOT’s load and wind generation forecast accuracy tends to make theDAMand RTMprices converge, thus enhancing ERCOT’s market trading efficiency. Finally, the estimated merit-order effects are greatest in the ERCOT zones where the wind generation capacity locally resides. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.;"Day-ahead market; Electric reliability council of texas (ercot); Merit-order effects; Real-time market; Wind generation";;0;0;1;0

A stochastic programming model is used to forecast, allowing many input data, where filtering is needed. A case study to evaluate forecasts for the next 24 h and the portfolio generated by way of stochastic programming are presented for a specific day-ahead electricity market. The case study spans four weeks of each one of the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 using a specific pre-treatment of input data of the stochastic programming (SP) model. In addition, the results are discussed, and the conclusions are drawn. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.";"ARIMA models; Day-ahead electricity market price; Forecasting portfolio; Stochastic programming";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Forecasting; Input output programs; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; ARIMA models; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Day-ahead electricity market; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity prices; Portfolio decisions; Renewable energies; Stochastic programming model; Power markets";1, 4;1;1;1
De Marcos R.A., Reneses J., Bello A.;Long-term Spanish electricity market price forecasting with cointegration and VEC models;2016;2016 International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems, PMAPS 2016 - Proceedings;2;Commodity and electricity price models are motivated by the several unexpected evolutions that commodity prices have shown over the previous decades. Several models are based on the classic Black-Scholes model, which was one of the first to simulate the stochastic behaviour of commodity prices. However, as of today, these forecasting models show poor performance when tested in long-term horizons, especially when applied to electricity market prices. This work attempts to determine a way to provide a decent accuracy in long-term (one year or more) forecasts of the Spanish electricity market price using cointegration and vector error correction (VEC) models, alongside other variables, such as fuel spot prices and futures prices. These variables have been assessed in order to determine which factors contribute to this work's purpose. © 2016 IEEE.;"Cointegration; Commodity Price Models; Electricity Markets; Error Correction Models; Long-Term Forecasting";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Error correction; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Black-Scholes model; Cointegration; Commodity prices; Electricity price model; Error correction models; Long-term forecasting; Spanish electricity markets; Vector error correction; Power markets";4;3;1;2
Hagfors L.I., Kamperud H.H., Paraschiv F., Prokopczuk M., Sator A., Westgaard S.;Prediction of extreme price occurrences in the German day-ahead electricity market;2016;Quantitative Finance;19;Understanding the mechanisms that drive extreme negative and positive prices in day-ahead electricity prices is crucial for managing risk and market design. In this paper, we consider the problem of understanding how fundamental drivers impact the probability of extreme price occurrences in the German day-ahead electricity market. We develop models using fundamental variables to predict the probability of extreme prices. The dynamics of negative prices and positive price spikes differ greatly. Positive spikes are related to high demand, low supply and high prices the previous days, and mainly occur during the morning and afternoon peak hours. Negative prices occur mainly during the night and are closely related to low demand combined with high wind production levels. Furthermore, we do a closer analysis of how renewable energy sources, hereby photovoltaic and wind power, impact the probability of negative prices and positive spikes. The models confirm that extremely high and negative prices have different drivers, and that wind power is particularly important in relation to negative price occurrences. The models capture the main drivers of both positive and negative extreme price occurrences and perform well with respect to accurately forecasting the probability with high levels of confidence. Our results suggest that probability models are well suited to aid in risk management for market participants in day-ahead electricity markets. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;"Energy markets; EPEX; Fundamental analysis; Spikes";;4;1;1;2
Sandhu H.S., Fang L., Guan L.;Forecasting day-ahead price spikes for the Ontario electricity market;2016;Electric Power Systems Research;20;A novel methodology based on neural networks is presented to forecast day-ahead electricity spikes and prices. Day-ahead electricity prices are forecasted by the first neural network trained using a data set consisting of similar price days. Next, spike prices are identified from the forecasted prices using a spike classifier, and these spikes are re-forecasted by using neural networks trained over historical spike hours. Finally, a data re-constructor is used to achieve the overall day-ahead electricity spike and price forecasting. Numerical experiments are conducted using data from the wholesale electricity market of Ontario, Canada, and significant improvements are achieved in terms of forecasting accuracy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;"Data mining; Electricity prices; Neural networks; Price forecasting; Spike forecasting";"Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Electric industry; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power quality; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Novel methodology; Numerical experiments; Ontario , Canada; Ontario electricity markets; Price forecasting; Wholesale electricity markets; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Kotur D., Zarkovic M.;Neural network models for electricity prices and loads short and long-Term prediction;2016;4th International Symposium on Environment Friendly Energies and Applications, EFEA 2016;10;In the framework of competitive electricity market, prices and load forecasting has become a real challenge for engineers in electric power systems. The increase of production from renewable sources increased number of factors that affect the cost and power consumption. On the other side, smart grids and the development of computers enable the use of artificial intelligence for solving such problems. This paper presents the multiple uses artificial neural networks (ANN) in long-Term and short-Term forecasting electricity prices and loads. Databases that are used for training ANN contain hours and thirty minutes data from British and Serbian power system. Data are related to the production of different energy sources, import / export of energy, temperature and load diagram form. Trained ANNs are used to predict energy prices and the formation of dynamic trifling for Serbia. Formed ANN models can be used for real time, on-line prediction of load and electricity price. © 2016 IEEE.;"long-Term forecasting; Neural networks; price and load prediciton; short-Term forecasting";"Costs; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Neural networks; Competitive electricity markets; Different energy sources; Electricity prices; Long-term forecasting; Long-term prediction; Neural network model; Prediciton; Short-term forecasting; Electric load forecasting";5;1, 3;1;1
Manner H., Türk D., Eichler M.;Modeling and forecasting multivariate electricity price spikes;2016;Energy Economics;11;We consider the problem of forecasting the occurrence of extreme prices in the Australian electricity markets from high frequency spot prices. In particular, we are interested in the simultaneous occurrence of such so-called spikes in two or more markets. Our approach is based on a novel dynamic model for multivariate binary outcomes, which allows the latent variables driving these observed outcomes to follow a vector autoregressive process. Furthermore the model is constructed using a copula representation for the joint distribution of the resulting innovations. This has several advantages over the standard multivariate probit model. First, it allows for nonlinear dependence between the error terms. Second, the distribution of the latent errors can be chosen freely. Third, the computational burden can be greatly reduced making estimation feasible in higher dimensions and for large samples. The model is applied to spikes in half-hourly electricity prices in four interconnected Australian markets. The multivariate model provides a superior fit compared to single-equation models and generates better forecasts for spike probabilities. Furthermore, evidence of spillover dynamics between the markets is revealed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;"Copulas; Electricity price spikes; Multivariate binary choice models; Vector autoregression";"Bins; Commerce; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Australian electricity market; Auto regressive process; Binary choice models; Copulas; Electricity price spikes; Modeling and forecasting; Multivariate modeling; Vector autoregressions; Costs; electricity supply; energy market; modeling; multivariate analysis; price dynamics; vector autoregression; Australia";4;1;1;1, 2
Wang J., Liu F., Song Y., Zhao J.;A novel model: Dynamic choice artificial neural network (DCANN) for an electricity price forecasting system;2016;Applied Soft Computing Journal;41;Big data mining, analysis, and forecasting always play a vital role in modern economic and industrial fields. Thus, how to select an optimization model to improve the forecasting accuracy of electricity price is not only an extremely challenging problem but also a concerned problem for different participants in an electricity market due to our society becoming heavily reliant on electricity. Many researchers developed hybrid models through the use of optimization methods, classical statistical models, artificial intelligence approaches and de-noising methods. However, few researchers aim to select reasonable samples and determine appropriate features when forecasting electricity price. Based on the Index of Bad Samples Matrix (IBSM), a novel method to dynamically confirm bad training samples, and the Optimization Algorithm (OA), DCANN and Updated DCANN are proposed in this paper for forecasting the day-ahead electricity price. This model is a hybrid system of supervised and unsupervised learning and creatively applies the idea of deleting bad samples and searching quality inputs to develop and learn, which is unlike BPANN, RBFN, SVM and LSSVM. Numerical results show that the proposed model is not only able to approximate the actual electricity price (normal or high volatility) but also an effective tool for h-step-ahead forecasting (h is less than 10) compared to benchmarks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;"Dynamic choosing artificial neural network (DCANN); Electricity price; Index of bad samples matrix (IBSM); Optimization algorithm (OA); Unsupervised learning";"Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Costs; Data mining; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Unsupervised learning; Bad samples; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Optimization algorithms; Optimization modeling; Supervised and unsupervised learning; Power markets";5;1, 2;1;1
Ziel F.;Forecasting Electricity Spot Prices Using Lasso: On Capturing the Autoregressive Intraday Structure;2016;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;48;In this paper we present a regression based model for day-ahead electricity spot prices. We estimate the considered linear regression model by the lasso estimation method. The lasso approach allows for many possible parameters in the model, but also shrinks and sparsifies the parameters automatically to avoid overfitting. Thus, it is able to capture the autoregressive intraday dependency structure of the electricity price well. We discuss in detail the estimation results which provide insights to the intraday behavior of electricity prices. We perform an out-of-sample forecasting study for several European electricity markets. The results illustrate well that the efficient lasso based estimation technique can exhibit advantages from two popular model approaches. © 2016 IEEE.;"Autocorrelation; day-ahead market; electricity price; Forecasting; intraday dependency; lasso";"Costs; Linear regression; Regression analysis; Dependency structures; Electricity spot price; Estimation methods; Estimation results; Estimation techniques; Forecasting electricity; Linear regression models; Regression-based model; Power markets";4;1;1, 2;1

Mohamed A., El-Hawary M.E.;Mid-term electricity price forecasting using SVM;2016;Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering;6;In the modern electricity market, it is very significant to have a precise electricity price forecasting in medium term time horizon. There are few studies done concentrating on the medium term forecasting of the electricity price. Medium term time horizon of electricity price forecasting is very useful and of great importance. It has many applications such as future maintenance scheduling of the power plants, risk management, plan future contracts, purchasing raw materials and determine the market pricing. To forecast the electricity price, some factors are very important, such as choosing the most useful price features that influence the market price, and choosing the proper prediction model that is able to predict the price variations behavior using the historical data. The proposed SVM method and the other employed methods are evaluated using the data from the New England ISO which are published at their official website. © 2016 IEEE.;"Features preprocessing; Forecasting; Neural Networks; Performance measures; RBF; Regression trees; SVM";"Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Neural networks; Risk management; Scheduling; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Features preprocessing; Maintenance scheduling; Performance measure; Prediction model; Price variation; Regression trees; Power markets";5;2;1;1
Anamika, Kumar N.;Market Clearing Price prediction using ANN in Indian Electricity Markets;2016;2016 International Conference on Energy Efficient Technologies for Sustainability, ICEETS 2016;6;The electricity industry is evolving into a distributed and competitive in which market forces drive the price of the electricity and reduce the net cost through increased competition. Forecasting system Market Clearing Volume (MCV) and Market Clearing Price (MCP) has become even more important in order to make optimal bidding and profit maximization. This research work presents Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based forecasting model to estimate future Market Clearing Prices in Indian Electricity Markets. The model is verified by comparing the results of ANN with Regression model. The performance of the ANN and Regression models are evaluated on the data available on Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) site for the period January 2013 to March 2014. This paper forecasts the daily MCPs for the months of January, February and March for the year 2014. It is found that the forecasted MCPs in the Indian Electricity Markets have the less agreement with the ANN model and appropriate agreement with the Regression model. Consequently, it confirms about the unreliability and highly sensitiveness of ANN with respect to regression model. The Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPEs) are evaluated to check the robustness of the two proposed methodologies. © 2016 IEEE.;"Artificial Neural Networks; Electricity Markets; forecasting; Market Clearing Price; Market Clearing Volume; Regression model";"Competition; Costs; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Electricity industry; Forecasting modeling; Market clearing; Market Clearing Price; Market clearing prices; Market-clearing price prediction; Mean absolute percentage error; Regression model; Commerce";5;2;1;1

In general, different market players need to know future electricity prices as their profitability depends on them. There are many papers have been presented on the forecasting of electricity market price such methods are based on time series, artificial intelligence and hybrid methods. In this paper, the price forecasting is presented by using feed forward artificial neural network by using historical price data. Accurately and efficiently forecasting of electricity price is more important. Therefore in this paper, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is designed for short term price forecasting of electricity in the environment of restructured power market. The proposed ANN model is a four-layered neural network, which consists of, input layer, two hidden layers and output layer. Matlab is used for training the proposed ANN model.

Pandey A.K., Chandra D., Tripathi M.M.;Short-term price forecasting using new wavelet-neural network with data pre filtering in ISO New England market;2016;International Conference on Emerging Trends in Electrical, Electronics and Sustainable Energy Systems, ICETEESES 2016;1;Effective load and price forecasting in presence of the noisy data collection process and complicated load features is important in deregulated power system. This paper presents a method of wavelet neural networks with data pre-filtering for short term price forecasting. The key idea is to use a spike filtering technique to detect spikes in load data and correct them. Wavelet decomposition is then used to decompose the filtered loads into multiple components at different frequencies, separate neural networks are applied to capture the features of individual components, and results of neural networks are then combined to form the final forecasts. To perform moving forecasts, six dedicated wavelet neural networks are used based on test results.

Cheng C., Luo B., Miao S., Wu X.;Mid-term electricity market clearing price forecasting with sparse data: A case in newly-reformed yunnan electricity market;2016;Energies;11;"For the power systems, for which few data are available for mid-term electricity market clearing price (MCP) forecasting at the early stage of market reform, a novel grey prediction model (defined as interval GM(0, N) model) is proposed in this paper. Over the traditional GM(0, N) model, three major improvements of the proposed model are: (i) the lower and upper bounds are firstly identified to give an interval estimation of the forecasting value; (ii) a novel whitenization method is then established to determine the definite forecasting value from the forecasting interval; and (iii) the model parameters are identified by an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) instead of the least square method (LSM) for the limitation of LSM. Finally, a newly-reformed electricity market in Yunnan province of China is studied, and input variables are contrapuntally selected. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by observed data. Compared with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, the traditional GM(0, N) model and the artificial neural network (ANN) model, the proposed model gives a better performance and its superiority is further ensured by the use of the modified Diebold-Mariano (MDM) test, suggesting that it is suitable for mid-term electricity MCP forecasting in a data-sparse electricity market. © 2016 by the authors.";"Grey prediction model; Market clearing price (MCP); Mid-term; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sparse data";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Linear regression; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); System theory; Artificial neural network models; Grey prediction model; Lower and upper bounds; Market Clearing Price; Market clearing prices; Mid-term; Multiple linear regression models; Sparse data; Power markets";5;2;1;2
Dash S.K., Bisoi R., Dash P.K.;A hybrid functional link dynamic neural network and evolutionary unscented Kalman filter for short-term electricity price forecasting;2016;Neural Computing and Applications;7;Electricity price is an important aspect in a restructured power market. Because of nonlinearity, nonstationary, and volatility of electricity price, it is highly essential to forecast the price on a short-term scale. This paper presents an efficient method based on a hybrid functional link dynamic neural network (DNN) trained by an adaptive robust unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The proposed method forecasts hourly prices for the day-ahead electricity market. The functional block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher-dimensional space through a basis function without using any hidden layer like multilayer perceptron structure. The DNN includes one or more infinite impulse response filters in the forward path providing feedback connections between outputs and inputs. This allows signal flow in both forward and backward directions, giving the network a dynamic memory useful to mimic dynamic systems. Also to improve the accuracy of the forecast, the noise covariance matrices of the UKF are adapted recursively. The proposed method is tested on PJM electricity market, and the residuals mean absolute error is compared with other forecasting methods, indicating the improved accuracy of the approach and its suitability to produce a real-time forecast. Further, to compare the accuracy of the forecast, an alternative UKF noise covariance optimization is attempted using differential evolution. © 2015, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.;"Dynamic neurons; Electricity price; Forecasting; Functional links; Unscented Kalman filter";"Commerce; Costs; Covariance matrix; Electric industry; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; IIR filters; Impulse response; Kalman filters; Neural networks; Nonlinear filtering; Optimization; Day-ahead electricity market; Dynamic neurons; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Functional links; Pjm electricity markets; Restructured power markets; Unscented Kalman Filter; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1
Mosbah H., El-Hawary M.;Hourly Electricity Price Forecasting for the Next Month Using Multilayer Neural Network;2016;Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering;17;Load and price forecasting are key challenges for current electricity market participants. Load and price in electricity markets have complex peculiarities, such as nonlinearity, being nonstationary and irregular. Accurate short-term forecasting, such as hourly electricity price forecasting (EPF) for the next month gives pivotal information to power producers and consumers to enhance precise techniques to maximize their profit. This paper deals with short-term hourly EPF for the next month (January 2006), using the historical hourly data for the year 2005 as a training set. A new approach of multilayer neural networks is applied in composite topologies in order to improve forecasting accuracy. The intent is to study the behavior of diverse composite topologies to compare the best performance indices evaluated by the mean absolute percentage error and mean square error. The performance of different topologies is compared to identify the best connection architecture. The data used in the forecasting are hourly historical data of the temperature, electricity load, and natural gas price from the Australian electricity markets. © 2003-2010 IEEE.;"Artificial neural networks; electricity price forecasting (EPF); load forecasting; multilayer neural networks";"Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Forecasting; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Natural gas; Neural networks; Power markets; Topology; Australian electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Load forecasting; Market participants; Mean absolute percentage error; Performance indices; Short-term forecasting; Electric load forecasting";5;2;1;1
Ziel F., Steinert R.;Electricity price forecasting using sale and purchase curves: The X-Model;2016;Energy Economics;29;Our paper aims to model and forecast the electricity price by taking a completely new perspective on the data. It will be the first approach which is able to combine the insights of market structure models with extensive and modern econometric analysis. Instead of directly modeling the electricity price as it is usually done in time series or data mining approaches, we model and utilize its true source: the sale and purchase curves of the electricity exchange. We will refer to this new model as X-Model, as almost every deregulated electricity price is simply the result of the intersection of the electricity supply and demand curve at a certain auction. Therefore we show an approach to deal with a tremendous amount of auction data, using a subtle data processing technique as well as dimension reduction and lasso based estimation methods. We incorporate not only several known features, such as seasonal behavior or the impact of other processes like renewable energy, but also completely new elaborated stylized facts of the bidding structure. Our model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of the electricity price, which is especially useful for predicting huge price spikes. Using simulation methods we show how to derive prediction intervals for probabilistic forecasting. We describe and show the proposed methods for the day-ahead EPEX spot price of Germany and Austria. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;"Auction data; Bidding behavior; Electricity price forecasting; Price spikes; Probabilistic forecasting; Supply and demand curves";"Costs; Data handling; Data mining; Economics; Energy policy; Forecasting; Auction data; Bidding behavior; Electricity price forecasting; Price spike; Probabilistic forecasting; Supply and demand; Power markets; computer simulation; data processing; econometrics; electricity generation; energy market; forecasting method; model test; numerical model; price dynamics; probability; Austria; Germany";4;1;1;2
Ghasemi A., Shayeghi H., Moradzadeh M., Nooshyar M.;A novel hybrid algorithm for electricity price and load forecasting in smart grids with demand-side management;2016;Applied Energy;95;Smart grid is a platform that enables the participants of electricity market to adjust their bidding strategies based on Demand-Side Management (DSM) models. Responsiveness of the market participants can improve reliability of system operation as well as capital cost investments. In this regard, the accurate forecast of electricity price and demand in smart grids is an important challenge as their strong correlation makes a separate forecasting to be ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneous forecast of price and demand that uses a set of effective tools in preprocessing part, forecast engine and tuned algorithm. To highlight our contributions, the proposed forecast algorithm classified into three main parts. The first part employs a new Flexible Wavelet Packet Transform (FWPT) to decompose a signal into multiple terms at different frequencies, and a new feature selection method that employs Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) and adjacent features in order to select valuable input data. The second part consists of a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model based on Nonlinear Least Square Support Vector Machine (NLSSVM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in order to model the linear and nonlinear correlation between price and load in two stages. The final part employs a modified version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm based on time-varying coefficients and stumble generation operator, called TV-SABC, in order to optimize NLSSVM parameters in a learning process. The proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm is evaluated on several real and well-known markets illustrating its high accuracy in simultaneous forecast of electricity price and demand. Moreover, the interactive effects of demand-side management programs on load factor (load curve) and price signal are investigated by numerical indices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.;"Demand-side management; Feature selection; Load and price forecasting; Smart grids; Wavelet transform";"Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Demand side management; Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Investments; Learning algorithms; MIMO systems; Optimization; Packet networks; Power markets; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Conditional mutual information; Feature selection methods; Multi-input-multi-output models; Price forecasting; Smart grid; Wavelet packet transforms; Smart power grids; algorithm; capital market; correlation; demand analysis; demand-side management; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; wavelet analysis; Apoidea";4, 5;1, 2;1;2
Aneiros G., Vilar J., Raña P.;Short-term forecast of daily curves of electricity demand and price;2016;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;31;The features of the electricity, as well as the rules of the competitive electricity markets, create the need of accurate predictions of electricity demand and price in order to anticipate decisions. Mainly, the prediction task in energy markets has been studied in the literature with the aim of obtaining scalar (hourly, daily, ...) forecasts given scalar (and/or, less frequently, functional) historical data. This paper provides two methods to predict next-day electricity demand and price daily curves given information from past curves. They are based on using robust functional principal component analysis and nonparametric models with functional both response and covariate. In addition, the nonparametric proposal is extended to incorporate, in a linear way, exogenous scalar covariates. Results of these methods for the electricity market of mainland Spain, in year 2012, are reported. Their accuracy is compared with that of a naïve method as well as with the corresponding to combining forecasts. Scalar versions are also included in the comparative study.

Li P., Arci F., Reilly J., Curran K., Belatreche A.;Using artificial neural networks to predict short-term wholesale prices on the Irish Single Electricity Market;2016;2016 27th Irish Signals and Systems Conference, ISSC 2016;2;Electricity markets are different from other markets as electricity generation cannot be easily stored in large amounts and in order to avoid blackouts, the generation of electricity must be balanced with customer demand for it on a second-by-second basis. Customers tend to rely on electricity for day-to-day living and cannot replace it easily so when electricity prices increase, customer demand generally does not reduce significantly in the short-term. As electricity generation and customer demand must be matched perfectly second-by-second, and because generation cannot be stored to a large extent, cost bids from generators must be balanced with demand estimates in advance of real-time. This paper outlines a a forecasting algorithm built on artificial neural networks in order to predict short-term (72 hours ahead) wholesale prices on the Irish Single Electricity Market so that market participants can make more informed trading decisions. Research studies have demonstrated that an adaptive or self-adaptive approach to forecasting would appear more suited to the task of predicting energy demands in territory such as Ireland. Implementing an in-house self-adaptive model should yield good results in the dynamic uncertain Irish energy market. We have identified the features that such a model demands and outline it here. © 2016 IEEE.;;"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Sales; Electricity generation; Electricity prices; Forecasting algorithm; Market participants; Research studies; Self adaptive approach; Self-adaptive models; Whole sale prices; Electric power generation";5;1;1;1

Moreira R., Bessa R., Gama J.;Probabilistic forecasting of day-ahead electricity prices for the Iberian electricity market;2016;International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM;6;With the liberalization of the electricity markets, price forecasting has become crucial for the decision-making process of market agents. The unique features of electricity price, such as non-stationary, non-linearity and high volatility make this a very difficult task. For this reason, rather than a simple point forecast, market participants are more interested in a probabilistic forecast that is essential to estimate the uncertainty involved in the price. By focusing on this issue, the aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of external factors in the electricity price and present a methodology for probabilistic forecasting of day-ahead electricity prices from the Iberian electricity market. The models are built using regression techniques and aim to obtain, for each hour, the quantiles of 5% to 95% by steps of 5%. © 2016 IEEE.;"Day-ahead forecast; Iberian electricity market; machine learning; probabilistic forecasting; quantile regression";"Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Electric industry; Forecasting; Learning systems; Uncertainty analysis; Day-ahead; Decision making process; Iberian electricity market; Market participants; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic forecasts; Quantile regression; Regression techniques; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;2
He D., Chen W.-P.;A real-time electricity price forecasting based on the spike clustering analysis;2016;Proceedings of the IEEE Power Engineering Society Transmission and Distribution Conference;3;This paper mainly focuses on the 5-minute resolution real-time price forecasting in New York electricity market. An accurate forecasting is regarded as a key to win the bidding in today's highly competitive electricity market. We propose a combination of support-vector machine (SVM) with self-organized map (SOM) to forecast the instance and magnitude of price spikes. The SVM is used for detecting the existence of the spike and the SOM is used to clustering the spike. To provide a price probability distribution for the spike values, the bagging mechanism is introduced to the SOM algorithm. A summer case study is presented to evaluate the proposed model. The result shows greatly potential of the proposed solution in the real applications. © 2016 IEEE.;"electricity market; electricity price; NYISO; SOM; SVM";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Support vector machines; Clustering analysis; Competitive electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; NYISO; Real applications; Real-time price; Self-organized map; Power markets";5;1;2;2
Singh N., Husain S., Mohanty S.R.;An improved WNN for day-ahead electricity price forecasting;2016;4th Students Conference on Engineering and Systems, SCES 2015;2;Price forecasting has become essential tool in deregulated electricity market. It is used by utility operators for bidding in the competitive market to increase their profits and services. The models for electricity price forecasting can be mainly categorized into (i) Statistical models, (ii) Artificial Intelligence models & (iii) Hybrid models. AI based models, i.e., ANN have gained popularity in the recent years due to their black box nature and non-linear mapping capability, it is generally trained using back propagation algorithm, which has got some serious limitations like large training time, local minima etc. In this work, comparison of various training algorithms for ANN has been presented for accurate electricity price forecasting problem, the results obtained are contrasted with the generic ANN model trained using back propagation (BP) algorithm and other popular training algorithm. It is found that the generic ANN with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training method provides better result as compared to other models. © 2015 IEEE.;"Artificial Neural Network; Back propagation; Price Forecasting; Wavelet Transform";"Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Wavelet transforms; Competitive markets; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Levenberg-Marquardt; Nonlinear mappings; Price forecasting; Training algorithms; Training methods; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1

Hybrid and evolutionary approaches are good candidates to surpass most of the previous concern considering time series prediction. In this sense, this work proposes a hybrid model composed by a novel combination of differential evolutionary particle swarm optimization (DEEPSO) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to predict, in the short-term, the wind power and EMP, testing its results with real and published case studies, proving its superior performance within a robust prediction software tool. © 2016 IEEE.;"Differential evolutionary particle swarm optimization; Electricity market prices; Forecasting; Short-term; Wind power";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Smart power grids; Software testing; Stochastic systems; Time series; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Competitive environment; Differential evolutionary; Evolutionary approach; Integration of renewable energies; Low computational complexity; Short term; Time series prediction; Electric power transmission networks";5;1;1;1
Vardanyan Y., Hesamzadeh M.R.;Modeling regime switching in day-ahead market prices using Markov model;2016;IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe;1;The accurate price forecasting of electricity market is crucial for profit maximizing producers and consumers in liberalized power markets. In all market places (day-ahead, intra-day and real-time) accurate price prediction is needed to generate optimal bids and maximize the profit. This paper first presents three methods for forecasting day-ahead market prices, namely Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heterosedastic (GARCH), Holt-Winter (HW) and Mean Reversion and Jump Diffusion (MRJD). These methods are based on three broad methodologies of time series analysis, exponential-smoothing and stochastic processes. The dynamics of hourly prices in day-ahead market are varying from day to day. Each forecasting tool is suitable to capture one type of price dynamics. To capture this phenomenon, we combine GARCH, HW and MRJD methods using proposed Markov switch. The proposed Markov model is tested using Nordic day-ahead prices. © 2016 IEEE.;"Day-ahead prices; forecasting tools; Markov switch";"Commerce; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Markov processes; Power markets; Profitability; Smart power grids; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive; Day ahead market; Day-ahead prices; Exponential smoothing; Forecasting tools; Price forecasting; Price prediction; Regime switching; Costs";3, 4;1;1;1
Panapakidis I.P., Dagoumas A.S.;Day-ahead electricity price forecasting via the application of artificial neural network based models;2016;Applied Energy;130;"Traditionally, short-term electricity price forecasting has been essential for utilities and generation companies. However, the deregulation of electricity markets created a competitive environment and the introduction of new market participants, such as the retailers and aggregators, whose economic viability and profitability highly depends on the spot market price patterns. The aim of this study is to examine artificial neural network (ANN) based models for Day-ahead price forecasting. Specifically, the models refer to the sole application of ANNs or to hybrid models, where the ANN is combined with clustering algorithm. The training data are clustered in homogenous groups and for each cluster, a dedicated forecaster is employed. The proposed models are characterized by comprehensive operation and by high level of flexibility; different inputs can be taken under consideration and different ANN topologies can be examined. The models are tested on a data set that consists of atypical price patterns and many outliers. This approach makes the price forecasting problem a more challenging task, providing evidence that the proposed models can be considered as useful and robust forecasting tools to the actual needs of market participants, including the traditional generation companies and self-producers, but also the retailers/suppliers and aggregators. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.";"Artificial neural networks; Day-ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Time-series clustering";"Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Competitive environment; Day ahead market; Economic viability; Electricity price forecasting; Generation companies; Market participants; Price forecasting; Time series clustering; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Rafiei M., Niknam T., Khooban M.H.;A novel intelligent strategy for probabilistic electricity price forecasting: Wavelet neural network based modified dolphin optimization algorithm;2016;Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems;12;To simplify decision making of market participants, a careful and reliable electricity market price forecasting method is indispensable. Nevertheless, due to the Instability in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather tough to forecast MCPs accurately. Using probabilistic forecasting is a new solution to overcome the low accuracy of forecast. Transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts is too important to model the uncertainties of forecasts. Thus the decision making activities of market participants are supported against uncertainties and risks effectively. In this paper a hybrid approach to achieve prediction intervals (PIs) of MCPs is proposed that modified dolphin echolocation optimization algorithm (MDEOA) is applied to estimate point forecasts, model uncertainties, and noise variance. This proposed electricity price probabilistic forecasting method is evaluated by a generalized and comprehensive framework. To test the proposed hybrid method, real price data from Ontario, New England, and, Australian electricity markets are used and effectiveness of the method is validated. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.;"modified dolphin echolocation optimization algorithm; prediction intervals; Probabilistic forecasting; wavelet neural network; wavelet preprocessing";"Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Dolphins (structures); Optimization; Power markets; Sonar; Uncertainty analysis; Optimization algorithms; Prediction interval; Probabilistic forecasting; Wavelet neural networks; Wavelet pre-processing; Forecasting";4, 5;1;1;2
Saini D., Saxena A.;Electric price forecast using interbreed approach of linear regression and SVM;2016;Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science;1;Electricity price forecasting is a hypercritical issue due to the involvement of consumers and producers in electricity markets. Price forecasting plays an important role in planning and managing economic operations related with the electrical power (bidding, trading) and other decisions related with load shedding and generation rescheduling. It is also useful for optimization in electrical energy trade. This paper explores an interbreed technique based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and linear regression to predict the day ahead electricity price using historical data as a raw insert. Different 27 linear regression models are formed to create initial framework for forecasting engine. Comparison of the performance of different forecasting engines is carried out on the basis of error indices namely Mean Square Error (MSE), Sum Square Error (SSE) and other conventional error indices. A detailed explanation of linear regression system based model is presented and simulation results exhibit that the proposed learning method is able to forecast electricity price in an effective manner. © 2016 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

In this paper, we look at hourly spot prices at the German electricity market and apply extreme value theory (EVT) to investigate the tails of the price change distribution. Our results show the importance of delimiting price spikes and modeling them separately from the core of the price distribution. In particular, we get a realistic fit of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) to autoregressive-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (AR-GARCH) filtered price change series; based on this model, accurate forecasts of extreme price quantiles are obtained. Generally, our results suggest that EVT is of interest for both risk managers and portfolio managers in the highly volatile electricity market. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.";"Electricity price modeling; Extreme value theory (evt); Forecasting of price quantiles; Price spikes; Value-at-risk (var)";;4;0;1;2

Hourly spot electricity price data for each of the five regions of Indian Electricity market from 1st of October 2010 to 15th November 2013 is used for the study to evaluate forecasting performance of the calibrated models. The conditional mean and conditional variance equations are estimated and one-step-ahead forecasts with a rolling window is performed. The fact that India being the only country in the world having power exchanges in-spite of demand outstripping supply and peak power shortage even to this day, further emphasizes the significance and criticality of spot electricity price forecasting from a power market participant's perspective and its practical relevance for Open access consumers in India. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.;"ARIMA-GARCH models; Indian energy exchange; Price forecasting; Spot electricity; Time series";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Power quality; Time series; Conditional means; Conditional variance; Energy exchanges; Forecasting performance; GARCH models; Market participants; Price forecasting; Spot electricity prices; Power markets";4;1;1;1
Nowotarski J., Weron R.;On the importance of the long-term seasonal component in day-ahead electricity price forecasting;2016;Energy Economics;32;In day-ahead electricity price forecasting (EPF) the daily and weekly seasonalities are always taken into account, but the long-term seasonal component (LTSC) is believed to add unnecessary complexity to the already parameter-rich models and is generally ignored. Conducting an extensive empirical study involving state-of-the-art time series models we show that (i) decomposing a series of electricity prices into a LTSC and a stochastic component, (ii) modeling them independently and (iii) combining their forecasts can bring - contrary to a common belief - an accuracy gain compared to an approach in which a given time series model is calibrated to the prices themselves. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;"Day-ahead market; Electricity spot price; Forecasting; Long-term seasonal component";"Costs; Forecasting; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Time series; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Long-term seasonal component; Stochastic component; Time series modeling; Time series models; Power markets; complexity; electricity supply; forecasting method; price determination; stochasticity; time series analysis";4;1;1;1
Lahouar A., Ben Hadj Slama J.;Comparative study of learning machine predictors for half-hour and day-ahead electricity price forecast in deregulated markets;2016;IREC 2016 - 7th International Renewable Energy Congress;2;The electricity markets all over the world have received several changes since the arrival of smart meters, real time pricing and deregulation waves. In such conditions, electricity price is a key index that reflects competition between generators, percentage of renewable generation and load behavior. An accurate forecast of the future price allows both producers and customers to plan their strategies, increase their profits and avoid contingencies. For this purpose, this paper proposes two predictors that perform half-hour-ahead and dayahead price forecast, respectively. Both predictors are based on three learning machines, namely artificial neural network, support vector regression and random forest, in addition to persistence model which is used as reference. The built models are tested through real historical time series from New South Wales in Australia, which include half-hourly price and load. The profiles are analyzed with the aim of defining correlations and choosing adequate inputs. Then, the performance of each machine is assessed using the mean absolute percentage error, in order to determine the most suitable prediction machine according to the case. Furthermore, the best forecast situations are plotted to evaluate the ability of predicting sudden and sharp price peaks. © 2016 IEEE.;"Artificial intelligence; Day-ahead market; Deregulation; Short term price forecasting";"Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Deregulation; Electric power measurement; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Comparative studies; Day ahead market; Day-ahead price forecasts; Deregulated markets; Mean absolute percentage error; Renewable generation; Short-term price forecasting; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets";5;1;1;1

Woo C.K., Moore J., Schneiderman B., Ho T., Olson A., Alagappan L., Chawla K., Toyama N., Zarnikau J.;Merit-order effects of renewable energy and price divergence in California's day-ahead and real-time electricity markets;2016;Energy Policy;64;We answer two policy questions: (1) what are the estimated merit-order effects of renewable energy in the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO's) day-ahead market (DAM) and real-time market (RTM)? and (2) what causes the hourly DAM and RTM prices to systematically diverge? The first question is timely and relevant because if the merit-order effect estimates are small, California's renewable energy development is of limited help in cutting electricity consumers' bills but also has a lesser adverse impact on the state's investment incentive for natural-gas-fired generation. The second question is related to the efficient market hypothesis under which the hourly RTM and DAM prices tend to converge. Using a sample of about 21,000 hourly observations of CAISO market prices and their fundamental drivers during 12/12/2012-04/30/2015, we document statistically significant estimates (p-value≤0.01) for the DAM and RTM merit-order effects. This finding lends support to California's adopted procurement process to provide sufficient investment incentives for natural-gas-fired generation. We document that the RTM-DAM price divergence partly depends on the CASIO's day-ahead forecast errors for system loads and renewable energy. This finding suggests that improving the performance of the CAISO's day-ahead forecasts can enhance trading efficiency in California's DAM and RTM electricity markets. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.;"California; Day-ahead market; Electricity prices; Merit-order effects; Real-time market; Renewable energy";"Commerce; Costs; Dams; Electric utilities; Investments; Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; California; Day ahead market; Electricity prices; Ordering effects; Real-time market; Renewable energies; Power markets; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; energy policy; price dynamics; renewable resource; California; United States";2, 4;1;1, 2;1
Hagfors L.I., Bunn D., Kristoffersen E., Staver T.T., Westgaard S.;Modeling the UK electricity price distributions using quantile regression;2016;Energy;23;In this paper we develop fundamental quantile regression models for the UK electricity price in each trading period. Intraday properties of price risk, as represented by the predictive distribution rather than expected values, have previously not been fully analyzed. The sample covers half hourly data from 2005 to 2012. From our analysis we are able to show how the sensitivity towards different fundamental factors changes across quantiles and time of day. In the UK the supply of electricity is to a large extent generated from coal and gas plants, thus the price of gas and coal, as well as the carbon emission price, are included as fundamental factors in our model. We also include the electricity price lagged by one day, as well as demand and margin forecasts. We find that the sensitivities vary across the price distribution. Our findings also suggest that the sensitivity to fundamental factors exhibit intraday variation. We find that the sensitivity to gas relative to coal is higher in high quantiles and lower in low quantiles, as well as some indications of market power being exercised during peak hours. We have demonstrated a scenario analysis based on the quantile regression models, showing how changes in the values of the fundamentals influence the electricity price distribution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.;"Electricity markets; Prices; Quantile regression; Risk";"Carbon; Coal; Commerce; Gas plants; Power markets; Regression analysis; Risks; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon emission prices; Electricity prices; Expected values; Predictive distributions; Prices; Quantile regression; Scenario analysis; Trading periods; Costs; carbon emission; demand analysis; energy market; power generation; price dynamics; pricing policy; regression analysis; risk assessment; United Kingdom";4;1;2;2
Dillig M., Jung M., Karl J.;The impact of renewables on electricity prices in Germany - An estimation based on historic spot prices in the years 2011-2013;2016;Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews;58;Germanys public opinion and media usually attribute increasing electricity prices to the high share of renewables in the German power system. But average electricity prices at the European Energy Exchange dropped during the last years due to an excess of renewable energy. This study uses historic market data in order to quantify the effect of renewables on prices. Historic demand and supply curves from 2011 to 2013 have been used to reconstruct electricity prices under the assumption that no wind and PV would be available. The analysis reveals an astonishingly high increase of market prices up to 5.29 ct/kWh due to a lack of non-renewable power capacities. In 2013 the available conventional capacity would not have been able to cover the demand during 269 hours. The estimated maximum deficit of 5.6 GW is in good agreement to data published by the German grid operators. The discussion of the origin of this deficit leads to the conclusion that the current situation has not been caused by renewables. The liberalization of the European energy market established investment risks that hindered required investment a long time before the renewables boomed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;"Electricity market modeling; Energy economics; Generation capacity; Merit order effect; Renewable electricity";"Commerce; Costs; Economics; Power markets; Social aspects; Electricity market model; Energy economics; Generation capacity; Ordering effects; Renewable electricity; Investments";−1;−1;1;−1
Ortiz M., Ukar O., Azevedo F., Múgica A.;Price forecasting and validation in the Spanish electricity market using forecasts as input data;2016;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;15;The electricity sector has been subjected to major changes in the last few years. Previously, there existed a regulated system where electric companies could know beforehand the amount of energy each generator would produce, hence basing their largely operational strategy on cost minimization in order to increase their profits. In Spain, from 1988 till 1997, electricity prices were established by the 'Marco Legal Estable' - Stable Legal Framework -, where the Ministry of Industry and Energy acknowledged the existence of certain generation costs related to each type of technology. It was an industrial sector with no actual competition and therefore, with very few controllable risks. In the aftermath of the electricity market liberalization competition and uncertainty arose. Electricity spot prices became highly volatile due to the specific characteristics of electricity as a commodity. Long-term contracts allowed for hedge funds to act against price fluctuation in the electricity market. As a consequence, developing an accurate electricity price forecasting model is an extremely difficult task for electricity market agents. This work aims to propose a methodology to improve the limitations of those methodologies just using historical data to forecast electricity prices. In this manner, and in order to gain access to more recent data, instead of using natural gas prices and electricity load historical data, a regression model to forecast the evolution of natural gas prices, and a model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to forecast electricity loads, are proposed. The results of these models are used as input for an electricity price forecast model. Finally, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, several study cases applied to the Spanish market, using real price data, are presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;"Artificial neural network; Electricity markets; Price forecast; Regression model; Volatility";"Commerce; Competition; Costs; Electric industry; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Natural gas; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Long-term contracts; Operational strategies; Price forecasts; Regression model; Spanish electricity markets; Volatility; Power markets";4, 5;3;1;1
Feijoo F., Silva W., Das T.K.;A computationally efficient electricity price forecasting model for real time energy markets;2016;Energy Conversion and Management;12;Increased significance of demand response and proliferation of distributed energy resources will continue to demand faster and more accurate models for forecasting locational marginal prices. This paper presents such a model (named K-SVR). While yielding prediction accuracy comparable with the best known models in the literature, K-SVR requires a significantly reduced computational time. The computational reduction is attained by eliminating the use of a feature selection process, which is commonly used by the existing models in the literature. K-SVR is a hybrid model that combines clustering algorithms, support vector machine, and support vector regression. K-SVR is tested using Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland market data from the periods 2005-6, 2011-12, and 2014-15. Market data from 2006 has been used to measure performance of many of the existing models. Authors chose these models to compare performance and demonstrate strengths of K-SVR. Results obtained from K-SVR using the market data from 2012 and 2015 are new, and will serve as benchmark for future models. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.;"Electricity price forecasting; Real time electricity markets; Support vector machine; Support vector regression";"Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Energy resources; Forecasting; Industrial economics; Support vector machines; Vectors; Computational reduction; Computationally efficient; Distributed Energy Resources; Electricity price forecasting; Locational marginal prices; Prediction accuracy; Real time; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets";5;1;1;1

Participants themselves feel that they can have assured return if the forecasted prices are accurate.

Therefore, they have been used extensively for classification and regression problems. Normally FNN uses TSK-type fuzzy rules where the consequent part of the rule base comprises linear terms. Thus FNNs may not be able to effectively handle chaotic time series like stock or electricity price time series by providing an accurate mapping. In this paper, therefore, the consequent part of the time series comprises the output from a functional link network that provides an expanded input dimension to handle the uncertainties and chaotic fluctuation of the time series databases. Further to improve the training speed for the weights of the FNN a second order Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is used.

Our objective is to build a demand model that is able to help an electricity retailer understand the customers' behaviour of using electricity with imperfect information and predict the demand of electricity in the future as accurately as possible. To achieve this objective, we establish the consistent conditions that the demand models must be satisfied and then learn the demand models to estimate the customers' consumption reaction functions to the retailer's prices from the available historical data. Simulation results confirm that the proposed demand models can generate a highly accurate prediction of electricity demand. © 2015 IEEE.;"day-Ahead dynamic pricing; demand modeling; smart grid";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Sales; Smart power grids; Demand modeling; Dynamic pricing; Electricity demands; Imperfect information; Reaction functions; Retail electricity markets; Smart grid; Two way communications; Power markets";4;1;1;1
Maisano J., Radchik A., Skryabin I.;A method of forecasting wholesale electricity market prices;2016;Journal of Energy Markets;1;In this paper, we employ a fundamental principle of classical mechanics known as the least-action principle to model the complex relationship between expected load and expected price in electricity spot markets.We consider markets that feature a centralized electricity dispatch system that optimizes grid parameters to determine the minimum spot nodal prices. Using the example of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) and a calibrated stochastic demand model, we develop a mathematical approach that determines the price evolution, including intraday and seasonal features. The proposed model links the concept of a deterministically modeled price with stochastically modeled demand. The demand-price relationship is complex, and it must include not only the level of demand within the constraint of maximum generating capacity, but also the change in demand within the constraints of generator ramping rates. While this paper uses the NEM as an example, the proposed approach is applicable to any energy market that satisfies the above conditions. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.;"Electricity market; Forecasting; Least-action principle (lap); National electricity market (nem); Spot price forecasting; Structural model";;0;0;1;0
Bello A., Reneses J., Muñoz A.;Medium-term probabilistic forecasting of extremely low prices in electricity markets: Application to the Spanish case;2016;Energies;15;One of the most relevant challenges that have arisen in electricity markets during the last few years is the emergence of extremely low prices. Trying to predict these events is crucial for market agents in a competitive environment. This paper proposes a novel methodology to simultaneously accomplish punctual and probabilistic hourly predictions about the appearance of extremely low electricity prices in a medium-term scope. The proposed approach for making real ex ante forecasts consists of a nested compounding of different forecasting techniques, which incorporate Monte Carlo simulation, combined with spatial interpolation techniques. The procedure is based on the statistical identification of the process key drivers. Logistic regression for rare events, decision trees, multilayer perceptrons and a hybrid approach, which combines a market equilibrium model with logistic regression, are used. Moreover, this paper assesses whether periodic models in which parameters switch according to the day of the week can be even more accurate. The proposed techniques are compared to a Markov regime switching model and several naive methods. The proposed methodology empirically demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving promising results on a real case study based on the Spanish electricity market. This approach can provide valuable information for market agents when they face decision making and risk-management processes. Our findings support the additional benefit of using a hybrid approach for deriving more accurate predictions. © 2016 by the authors.;"Electricity markets; Extremely low prices; Hybrid approach; Medium-term electricity price forecasting; Probabilistic forecasting; Spikes";"Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Power markets; Regression analysis; Risk management; Electricity price forecasting; Extremely low prices; Hybrid approach; Probabilistic forecasting; Spikes; Decision making";4;2;1;2
Reddy S.S., Jung C.-M., Seog K.J.;Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using back propagation neural networks and weighted least square technique;2016;Frontiers in Energy;7;This paper proposes the day-ahead electricity price forecasting using the artificial neural networks (ANN) and weighted least square (WLS) technique in the restructured electricity markets. Price forecasting is very important for online trading, e-commerce and power system operation. Forecasting the hourly locational marginal prices (LMP) in the electricity markets is a very important basis for the decision making in order to maximize the profits/benefits. The novel approach proposed in this paper for forecasting the electricity prices uses WLS technique and compares the results with the results obtained by using ANNs. To perform this price forecasting, the market knowledge is utilized to optimize the selection of input data for the electricity price forecasting tool. In this paper, price forecasting for Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection is demonstrated using the ANNs and the proposed WLS technique. The data used for this price forecasting is obtained from the PJM website. The forecasting results obtained by both methods are compared, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting approach. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the accuracy of prediction has increased in both seasons using the proposed WLS technique. Another important advantage of the proposed WLS technique is that it is not an iterative method. © 2016, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;"artificial neural networks; day-ahead electricity markets; load forecasting; load serving entities; price forecasting";;5;1;1;1
Maciejowska K., Weron R.;Short- and Mid-Term Forecasting of Baseload Electricity Prices in the U.K.: The Impact of Intra-Day Price Relationships and Market Fundamentals;2016;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;27;In this paper we investigate whether considering the fine structure of half-hourly electricity prices, the market closing prices of fundamentals (natural gas, coal and ${\rm CO}2) and the system-wide demand can lead to significantly more accurate short- and mid-term forecasts of APX U.K. baseload prices. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of a number of univariate and multivariate time series models over a three-year out-of-sample forecasting period and compare it against that of a benchmark autoregressive model. We find that in the short-term, up to a few business days ahead, a disaggregated model which independently predicts the intra-day prices and then takes their average to yield baseload price forecasts is the best performer. However, in the mid-term, factor models which explore the correlation structure of intra-day prices lead to significantly (as measured by the Diebold-Mariano test) better baseload price forecasts. At the same time, we observe that the inclusion of fundamental variables - especially natural gas prices (in the short-term) and coal prices (in the mid-term) - provides significant gains. The CO2 prices, on the other hand, generally do not improve the price forecasts at all, at least in the time period considered in this study (April 2009-December 2013). © 1969-2012 IEEE.;"Electricity price; factor model; forecasting; principal components; vector autoregression";"Commerce; Forecasting; Natural gas; Auto regressive models; Correlation structure; Electricity prices; Fine structures; Multivariate time series models; Natural gas price; Predictive accuracy; Price forecasts; Costs";4;1, 2;1;1
Alamaniotis M., Bourbakis N., Tsoukalas L.H.;Very-short term forecasting of electricity price signals using a Pareto composition of kernel machines in smart power systems;2016;2015 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing, GlobalSIP 2015;4;In smart power distribution systems price forecasting is an indispensable participant tool for developing purchase strategies. This paper places itself in price directed power systems, where participants respond with their load demand to incoming price signals. To that end, a two hour-ahead forecasting method using a linear composition of kernel machines for electricity prices is introduced. Initially, two kernel machines, i.e., a Gaussian process (GP) and a relevance vector machine (RVM), are utilized for next-two-hour prediction making. Subsequently, a linear predictor composed of the two kernel machines, which are both equipped with the Gaussian kernel, is built that integrates the individual predictions to provide a single one. The linear coefficients are obtained as the solution of multiobjective problem that is sought by a genetic algorithm utilizing Pareto optimality theory. Method testing is performed on a set of historical data obtained from the New England area. The proposed Pareto optimal kernel machine composition outperforms in terms of accuracy the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) predictor as well as the individual kernel machines in the vast majority of the tested cases. © 2015 IEEE.;"Electricity price forecasting; GP; Pareto optimality; RVM; smart power systems";"Forecasting; Gaussian noise (electronic); Genetic algorithms; Global positioning system; Information science; Pareto principle; Power markets; Autoregressive moving average; Electricity price forecasting; Individual prediction; Multi-objective problem; Pareto-optimality; Relevance Vector Machine; Smart power distribution systems; Very short term forecasting; Costs";4;1;1;1
Pape C., Hagemann S., Weber C.;Are fundamentals enough? Explaining price variations in the German day-ahead and intraday power market;2016;Energy Economics;42;European electricity market participants are encouraged to balance intraday deviations from their day-ahead schedules via trades in the intraday market. Together with the increasing production of variable renewable energy sources (RES), the intraday market is gaining importance. We investigate the explanatory power of a fundamental modeling approach explicitly accounting for must-run operations of combined heat and power plants (CHP) and intraday peculiarities such as a shortened intraday supply stack. The fundamental equilibria between every hour's supply stack and aggregated demand in 2012 and 2013 are modeled to yield hourly price estimates. The major benefits of a fundamental modeling approach are the ability to account for non-linearities in the supply stack and the ability to combine time-varying information consistently. The empirical results show that fundamental modeling explains a considerable share of spot price variance. However, differences between the fundamental and actual prices persist and are explored using regression models. The main differences can be attributed to (avoided) start up-costs, market states and trading behavior. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;"Fundamental price modeling; Intraday market for electricity";"Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Costs; Regression analysis; Renewable energy resources; Explanatory power; Fundamental models; Increasing production; Market participants; Price models; Regression model; Time-varying information; Variable renewable energies; Power markets; demand analysis; electricity supply; energy market; heat production; power plant; price dynamics; Germany";2;1;1, 2;1
Bessec M., Fouquau J., Meritet S.;Forecasting electricity spot prices using time-series models with a double temporal segmentation;2016;Applied Economics;8;The French wholesale market is set to expand in the next few years under European pressure and national decisions. In this article, we assess the forecasting ability of several classes of time-series models for electricity wholesale spot prices at a day-ahead horizon in France. Electricity spot prices display a strong seasonal pattern, particularly in France, given the high share of electric heating in housing during winter time. To deal with this pattern, we implement a double temporal segmentation of the data. For each trading period and season, we use a large number of specifications based on market fundamentals: linear regressions, Markov-switching (MS) models and threshold models with a smooth transition. An extensive evaluation on French data shows that modelling each season independently leads to better results. Among nonlinear models, MS models designed to capture the sudden and fast-reverting spikes in the price dynamics yield more accurate forecasts. Finally, pooling forecasts give more reliable results. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.;"combinations; electricity spot prices; Forecasting; regime-switching; seasonality";"electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; Markov chain; modeling; price dynamics; seasonality; time series; France";3;1;1;1
Keles D., Scelle J., Paraschiv F., Fichtner W.;Extended forecast methods for day-ahead electricity spot prices applying artificial neural networks;2016;Applied Energy;105;Day-ahead electricity prices are generally used as reference prices for decisions done in energy trading, e.g. purchase and sale strategies are typically based on the day-ahead spot prices. Therefore, well-performing forecast methods for day-ahead electricity prices are essential for energy traders and supply companies.In this paper, a methodology based on artificial neuronal networks (ANN) is presented to forecast electricity prices. As the performance of an ANN forecast model depends on appropriate input parameter sets, the focus is set on the selection and preparation of fundamental data that has a noticeable impact on electricity prices. This is done with the help of different cluster algorithms, but also by comparing the results of the pre-selected model configurations in combination with different input parameter settings. After the determination of the optimal input parameters, affecting day-ahead electricity prices, and well-performing ANN configuration, the developed ANN model is applied for in-sample and out-of-sample analyses. The results show that the overall methodology leads to well-fitting electricity price forecasts, whereas forecast errors are as low as or even lower than other forecast models for electricity prices known from the literature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;"Artificial neuronal network; Day-ahead-market; Electricity prices; Input selection; Price forecasting";"Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Neural networks; Neurons; Artificial neuronal network; Day ahead market; Electricity prices; Input selection; Price forecasting; Power markets; algorithm; artificial neural network; electricity generation; energy market; forecasting method";5;1;1;1

Monteiro C., Ramirez-Rosado I.J., Fernandez-Jimenez L.A., Conde P.;Short-term price forecasting models based on artificial neural networks for intraday sessions in the Iberian electricity market;2016;Energies;26;"This paper presents novel intraday session models for price forecasts (ISMPF models) for hourly price forecasting in the six intraday sessions of the Iberian electricity market (MIBEL) and the analysis of mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) obtained with suitable combinations of their input variables in order to find the best ISMPF models. Comparisons of errors from different ISMPF models identified the most important variables for forecasting purposes. Similar analyses were applied to determine the best daily session models for price forecasts (DSMPF models) for the day-ahead price forecasting in the daily session of the MIBEL, considering as input variables extensive hourly time series records of recent prices, power demands and power generations in the previous day, forecasts of demand, wind power generation and weather for the day-ahead, and chronological variables. ISMPF models include the input variables of DSMPF models as well as the daily session prices and prices of preceding intraday sessions. The best ISMPF models achieved lower MAPEs for most of the intraday sessions compared to the error of the best DSMPF model; furthermore, such DSMPF error was very close to the lowest limit error for the daily session. The best ISMPF models can be useful for MIBEL agents of the electricity intraday market and the electric energy industry. © 2016 by the authors.";"Daily session prices; Electricity market prices; Iberian electricity market (MIBEL); Intraday session prices; Short-term forecasting";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Errors; Forecasting; Neural networks; Time series analysis; Wind power; Analysis of means; Daily session prices; Electric energies; Forecasting purpose; Iberian electricity market; Intraday session prices; Short-term forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Power markets";5;1;1, 2;1

The study is conducted over a 2-year long period, with hourly data of the prices to be predicted and a large set of variables used as predictors (i.e. historical prices, forecast load, wind and solar power forecasts, expected plenty or shortage of hydroelectric production, net transfer capacity available at the interconnections and the gas prices). A Neural Network (NN) and a Support Vector Regression (SVR) are applied on the different predictors to obtain the final forecasts.

Aghaebrahimi M.R., Taherian H.;Short-term price forecasting considering distributed generation in the price-sensitive environment of smart grids;2016;4th Iranian Conference on Renewable Energy and Distributed Generation, ICREDG 2016;3;In smart grids environment, all participants, including different load types, are able to utilize the network. Advances in measurement tools in these networks make it easy to move towards dynamic pricing and non-fixed electricity tariffs. In this environment, the forecasted electricity price is declared to wholesale and retail consumers via Advanced Measurement Instruments (AMI). Therefore, motivated by different factors such as optimizing the economic/environmental issues or increasing the reliability, the customers are able to react to prices and manage their consumption. This pattern of reaction brings about extensive changes in the load and price curves of the network. On the other hand, environmental concerns resulting from the use of fossil fuels have increased the exploitation of renewable energies. But, as the penetration of renewable energy sources increases, serious improvements and modifications for the existing electric grid are needed to accommodate and integrate these intermittent sources. In this paper, a hybrid model is presented for simultaneous short term forecasting of electricity prices considering Distributed Generation (DG) in the price-sensitive environment of smart grids. The proposed model combines the Support Vector Regression (SVR) network with an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) network, and it is capable of tracking customers' reaction to declared prices. This model is applied on the data of power markets of Nordpool regrion, Denmark, where the smart grids are very active. The results of short term price forecasting for a target day (1/1/2016) shows the accuracy of the model. © 2016 IEEE.;"Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system; Distributed generation; Price-sensitive; Short-term price forecasting; Smart grids";"Costs; Distributed power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS); Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Measurement instruments; Price sensitive; Renewable energy source; Short-term price forecasting; Smart grid; Support vector regression (SVR); Smart power grids";5;1;1;1

Wang K., Xu C., Guo S.;Big data analytics for price forecasting in smart grids;2016;2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2016 - Proceedings;10;Demand side management (DSM) is a key mechanism to make smart grids cost efficient using electricity price forecasting issue. Price forecasting method takes the big price data into account, and gives estimates of the future electricity price. However, most of existing price forecasting methods cannot avoid redundancy at feature selection and lack of an integrated framework that coordinates the steps in forecasting. To address this issue, we first propose a new electricity price forecasting framework. It is significant to design a system tool chain based on big data analytics for ensuring that the users can make appropriate decisions. To this end, three algorithms are proposed integratedly. First, feature redundancy elimination is implemented by the fusion of Grey Correlation Analysis (GCA) and ReliefF algorithm. Second, a combination of Kernel function and Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) is designed to achieve dimensionality reduction. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization algorithm based on differential evolution (DE) is proposed to forecast price classification. These three modules jointly power the price forecasting system. Simulation results show the superiority of our proposed framework. © 2016 IEEE.;"Big data; Classification; Demand side management; Dimensionality reduction; Feature selection; Price forecasting; Smart girds";"Classification (of information); Costs; Demand side management; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Optimization; Power markets; Principal component analysis; Redundancy; Smart power grids; Support vector machines; Differential Evolution; Dimensionality reduction; Electricity price forecasting; Grey correlation analysis; Optimization algorithms; Price forecasting; Principle component analysis; Smart girds; Big data";4, 5;1;1;1

Sisodia G.S.;Methodology for Electricity Price Forecasting in the Long Run;2016;Energy Procedia;1;"The long-term forecasting of electricity price has received less attention in literature. A probable reason for less attention is uncertainty about various factors in the long run, for instance- oil price, regulatory policies, political intervention, technological changes, energy mix, grid operations, etc. As a general operation, energy generated through different sources is supplied to grid which is finally composed of ""energy mix"". A large decision on the finalisation of retail electricity price could also depend on the load factors and capacity utilization of energy generating plants. A majority of the studies dealing with electricity price forecast electricity prices in the short run. Whereas, the aim of this study is to present a long-term perspective by introducing a methodology framework that consists of various parameters associated with the forecasting of electricity price in the long run. To the best of our understanding, this framework has not been proposed in existing energy literature, and therefore, under an assumption that future electricity market will be dominated by clean energy generation, this study brings novelty to the literature.";"carbon price; electricity price forecasting; energy mix; long run electricity prices";"Carbon; Costs; Environmental technology; Forecasting; Carbon price; Clean energy generation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Energy mix; Long-term forecasting; Long-term perspective; Technological change; Power markets";0;3;0;0
Mori H., Nakano K.;An Efficient Hybrid Intelligent Method for Electricity Price Forecasting;2016;Procedia Computer Science;1;In this paper an efficient method is proposed for electricity price forecasting. This paper focuses on Locational Marginal Price (LMP) that efficiently maintains power markets by alleviating transmission network congestion. There are complicated behaviors of the time series due to uncertain factors in the power markets. From a standpoint of market players, a sophisticated method is required to forecast LMP effectively. The proposed method makes use of the hybridization of GP (Gaussian Process) of hierarchical Bayesian estimation, EPSO (Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization) of evolutionary computation and fuzzy c-means of allowing data to belong to two or more clusters. EPSO is used to improve the accuracy of parameters in MAP (Maximum a Posteriori) estimation for GP. The use of fuzzy c-mean is useful for increasing the number of learning data for GP to deal with spikes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated for real LMP data. © 2016 The Authors.;"clustering; EPSO; evolutionary computation; forecasting; fuzzy c-mean; Gaussian Process;Hierarchical Bayesian Estimation";"Adaptive systems; Bayesian networks; Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); clustering; Electricity price forecasting; EPSO; Evolutionary particle swarm optimizations; Fuzzy C mean; Hierarchical bayesian; Hybrid intelligent method; Locational marginal prices; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1
Osório G.J., Gonçalves J.N.D.L., Lujano-Rojas J.M., Catalão J.P.S.;Enhanced forecasting approach for electricity market prices and wind power data series in the short-term;2016;Energies;14;The uncertainty and variability in electricity market price (EMP) signals and players' behavior, as well as in renewable power generation, especially wind power, pose considerable challenges. Hence, enhancement of forecasting approaches is required for all electricity market players to deal with the non-stationary and stochastic nature of such time series, making it possible to accurately support their decisions in a competitive environment with lower forecasting error and with an acceptable computational time. As previously published methodologies have shown, hybrid approaches are good candidates to overcome most of the previous concerns about time-series forecasting. In this sense, this paper proposes an enhanced hybrid approach composed of an innovative combination of wavelet transform (WT), differential evolutionary particle swarm optimization (DEEPSO), and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to forecast EMP signals in different electricity markets and wind power in Portugal, in the short-term, considering only historical data.

Alonso A.M., Bastos G., García-Martos C.;Electricity price forecasting by averaging dynamic factor models;2016;Energies;6;"In the context of the liberalization of electricity markets, forecasting prices is essential. With this aim, research has evolved to model the particularities of electricity prices. In particular, dynamic factor models have been quite successful in the task, both in the short and long run. However, specifying a single model for the unobserved factors is difficult, and it cannot be guaranteed that such a model exists. In this paper, model averaging is employed to overcome this difficulty, with the expectation that electricity prices would be better forecast by a combination of models for the factors than by a single model. Although our procedure is applicable in other markets, it is illustrated with an application to forecasting spot prices of the Iberian Market, MIBEL (The Iberian Electricity Market).

Jiang P., Liu F., Song Y.;A hybrid multi-step model for forecasting day-ahead electricity price based on optimization, fuzzy logic and model selection;2016;Energies;10;"The day-ahead electricity market is closely related to other commodity markets such as the fuel and emission markets and is increasingly playing a significant role in human life. Thus, in the electricity markets, accurate electricity price forecasting plays significant role for power producers and consumers. Although many studies developing and proposing highly accurate forecasting models exist in the literature, there have been few investigations on improving the forecasting effectiveness of electricity price from the perspective of reducing the volatility of data with satisfactory accuracy. Based on reducing the volatility of the electricity price and the forecasting nature of the radial basis function network (RBFN), this paper successfully develops a two-stage model to forecast the day-ahead electricity price, of which the first stage is particle swarm optimization (PSO)-core mapping (CM) with self-organizing-map and fuzzy set (PCMwSF), and the second stage is selection rule (SR). The PCMwSF stage applies CM, fuzzy set and optimized weights to obtain the future price, and the SR stage is inspired by the forecasting nature of RBFN and effectively selects the best forecast during the test period. The proposed model, i.e., CM-PCMwSF-SR, not only overcomes the difficulty of reducing the high volatility of the electricity price but also leads to a superior forecasting effectiveness than benchmarks. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.";"Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reducing volatility; Selection rule (SR); Self-organizing-map";"Commerce; Computer circuits; Conformal mapping; Costs; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; Self organizing maps; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting models; Highly accurate; Radial basis function Networks (RBFN); Reducing volatility; Selection Rules; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1

High price volatilities, price spikes caused by a number of factors such as weather uncertainty, fluctuating fuel prices, transmission bottlenecks, etc., make the task of accurate price forecasting a formidable challenge for the market participants. A number of models have been proposed by researchers; however, achieving high accuracy is always not possible. In some specific applications such as self-scheduling by demand side participants, certain price thresholds are more useful than accurate price forecasts. In this paper, we have investigated the application of a novel neural network-based technique called extreme learning machine for the problem of classification of future electricity prices with respect to certain price thresholds.

Bigerna S., Bollino C.A.;Ramsey prices in the Italian electricity market;2016;Energy Policy;9;In this paper,we derive optimal zonal prices in the Italian day-ahead electricity market using estimation of a complete system of hourly demand in 2010-2011.In Italy, the hourly equilibrium price for all buyers is computed as a uniform average of supply zonal prices,resulting from market splitting due to line congestion. We model exante individual bids expressed by heterogeneous consumers, which are distinguished by geographical zones. Using empirical estimations,we compute demand elasticity values and new zonal prices, according to a Ramsey optimal scheme. This is a new approach in the wholesale electricity market literature, as previous studies have discussed the relative merit of zonal prices, considering only the issue of line congestion. Our results show that the optimal pricing scheme can improve welfare in the day-ahead Italian electricity market, with respect to both the existing uniform price scheme and the proposal to charge the existing supply zonal prices to the demand side. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;"Demand elasticity; Electricity markets; Heterogeneous consumers'behavior; Optimal ramsey prices; Zonal prices";"Commerce; Consumer behavior; Elasticity; Electric industry; Power markets; Demand elasticities; Electricity market; Heterogeneous consumers' behavior; Ramsey prices; Zonal prices; Costs; consumption behavior; demand elasticity; demand-side management; electricity; energy market; price dynamics; Italy";1;1;1;1

Using ACO for feature selection significantly reduced the training time for ANN-based electricity price forecasting model while the results were almost as accurate as those from ANN model. © 2015 IEEE.;"Ant Colony Optimization; Artificial Neural Networks; Electricity price forecasting; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machines";"Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Comparative studies; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity prices forecasting; Machine learning methods; Power producer; Price forecasting; Power markets";5;1;1;1
He K., Yu L., Tang L.;Electricity price forecasting with a BED (Bivariate EMD Denoising) methodology;2015;Energy;22;The forecasting of electricity price remains the subject of increasingly intense research attention as the market structure becomes more complicated with the deregulation waves and the increasing level of price fluctuations observed. The heterogeneous data structure revealed in the recent empirical studies serves as the important stylized fact to be explored and analyzed in the heterogeneous market structure framework. Facing the increasingly diversified and more integrated market environment, the forecasting model in the electricity markets needs to take into account the individual and inter dependent heterogeneity features such as noises. In this paper, under the proposed HMH (Heterogeneous Market Hypothesis), we propose a BED (Bivariate EMD Denoising) based forecasting methodology to track and predict the electricity price movement. The BED algorithm is introduced as the feature extraction tool to identify and remove the noises, where the Error Entropy is further used as the criteria to determine the optimal level in EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) to be shrinkaged. Empirical studies conducted in the Australian electricity markets demonstrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed BED algorithm incorporating the heterogeneous market characteristics, against benchmark models. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;"BED (Bivariate EMD Denoising Algorithm); Cross-correlation; Electricity market; Vector autoregressive model";"Algorithms; Benchmarking; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Signal processing; Australian electricity market; Cross correlations; De-noising algorithm; Electricity price forecasting; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Heterogeneous market hypothesis; Heterogeneous markets; Vector autoregressive model; Power markets; algorithm; correlation; electricity; empirical analysis; energy market; error analysis; forecasting method; heterogeneity; market conditions; noise; performance assessment; price determination; regression analysis; vector; Australia";4;1;1;1
Singh N., Tiwari S., Mohanty S.R., Yadav D.;A modified cost function generalized neuron for electricity price forecasting in deregulated power markets;2015;ACM International Conference Proceeding Series;;Price forecasting has become one of the key factors for competition in the deregulated electricity market and it is necessary to know future electricity prices for generating companies as their profitability depends on them. The precision of the price forecasting model is essential in bidding strategies. The major problem with the models based on artificial neural networks is that they usually need a large number of training data and neurons. To overcome these issues, a new structure using generalized neurons (GN) is being adopted which require smaller data set for training which makes it very useful for price forecasting for places where historical data available is not sufficient to use ANN. In the proposed work, a hybrid model using generalized neuron is used for comparing the performance using different cost functions. © 2015 ACM.;"Error functions; Generalized neuron model; Price forecasting; Wavelet transform";"Commerce; Cost functions; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Neurons; Wavelet transforms; Deregulated electricity market; Deregulated power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Error function; Generalized neuron; Generating companies; Price forecasting; Power markets";−1;−1;−1;−1
Maciejowska K., Weron R.;Forecasting of daily electricity prices with factor models: utilizing intra-day and inter-zone relationships;2015;Computational Statistics;15;This paper investigates whether using hourly and/or zonal prices can improve the accuracy of short- and medium-term forecasts of average daily electricity prices. We consider a 6 years period (2008–2013) of hourly day-ahead prices from 19 zones of the Pennsylvania–New Jersey–Maryland (PJM) interconnection and the PJM Dominion Hub in Virginia, U.S. The predictive performance of four multivariate models calibrated to hourly and/or zonal day-ahead prices is evaluated and compared with that of a univariate model, which uses only average daily data for the Dominion Hub. The multivariate competitors include a restricted vector autoregressive model and three factor models with the common and idiosyncratic components estimated using principal components in a semiparametric setup. The results indicate that there are statistically significant forecast improvements from incorporating the additional information, essentially for all considered forecast horizons ranging from 1 day to 2 months, but only when the correlation structure of prices across locations and/or hours is modeled using factor models. © 2014, The Author(s).;"Factor model; Forecasting; PJM market; Principal components; Vector autoregression; Wholesale electricity price";;4;1, 2;1;1
Mori H., Nakano K.;EPSO-based Gaussian process for electricity price forecasting;2015;2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2015 - Proceedings;1;In this paper, a new method is proposed for Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) forecasting in Smart Grid. The marginal cost is required to supply electric power to incremental loads in case where a certain node increases power demands in a balanced power system. LMP plays an important role to maintain economic efficiency in electric power markets in a way that electricity flows from a low-cost area to high-cost ones and the transmission network congestion is alleviated. The power market players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their aim is achieved. This paper presents the Gaussian Process (GP) technique that comes from the extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in which hierarchical Bayesian estimation is introduced to express the model parameters as the probabilistic variables. The advantage is that the model accuracy of GP is better than others. GP is integrated with k-means of clustering to improve the performance of GP. Also, this paper makes use of the Mahalanobis kernel in GP rather than the Gaussian one so that GP is generalized to approximate nonlinear systems. EPSO of evolutionary computation is applied to GP to determine the parameters of the kernel function. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated for real data of ISO New England in USA. © 2015 IEEE.;"Electricity Price; EPSO; Gaussian Process; K-means; Locational Marginal Price; Mahalanobis Kernel; Time Series";"Bayesian networks; Calculations; Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Parameter estimation; Power markets; Support vector machines; Time series; Electricity prices; EPSO; Gaussian Processes; K-means; Locational marginal prices; Mahalanobis; Electric power transmission networks";5;0;1;1
Sahay K.B.;One hour ahead price forecast of Ontario electricity market by using ANN;2015;International Conference on Energy Economics and Environment - 1st IEEE Uttar Pradesh Section Conference, UPCON-ICEEE 2015;3;In restructured electricity markets, forecasting electricity parameters are most essential tasks & basis for any decision making. Forecasting price in competitive electricity markets is difficult for consumers and producers in order to plan their operations and to manage their price risk, and it also plays a key role in the economic optimization of the deregulated power industry. Accurate, short-term price forecasting is an essential instrument which provides crucial information for power producers and consumers to develop accurate bidding strategies in order to maximize their profit. In this paper artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in short-term price forecasting that is, the one hour ahead price forecast of the electricity market. A new artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to compute the forecasted price in Ontario electricity market using MATLAB R13b. The data used in the forecasting are hourly historical data of the electricity load and price of Ontario electricity market. The simulation results have shown highly accurate one hour ahead forecasts with very small error in price forecasting. © 2015 IEEE.;"locational marginal price (LMP); mean absolute error (MAE); mean absolute percentage error (MAPE); neural network (NN); One hour ahead electricity price forecast; power system; short-term price forecasting";"Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Deregulation; Economics; Electric industry; Errors; Forecasting; MATLAB; Neural networks; Electricity prices; Locational marginal prices; Mean absolute error; Mean absolute percentage error; Neural network (nn); power system; Short-term price forecasting; Power markets";5;1;2;1
Singh N.K., Singh A.K., Tripathy M.;Short-term load/price forecasting in deregulated electric environment using ELMAN neural network;2015;International Conference on Energy Economics and Environment - 1st IEEE Uttar Pradesh Section Conference, UPCON-ICEEE 2015;4;Load forecasting plays a significant role in power system planning. In today's scenario of deregulated electricity market as existing in New South Wales (NSW) Australia, an extremely accurate load/ price forecasting model is required because of several economic and operational advantages. It helps in dealing with the problems of economic load dispatch, unit commitment, protection, etc. Research shows that most of the classical methods are incapable to forecast the load/ price with highest possible precision, as per the expectation of deregulated and complex electricity markets. In this paper, Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Short Term Load Forecasting (STLF) model, i.e., ELMAN Neural Network (ELMNN) is developed and tested on NSW Australia data. The performance of the ELMNN-based model is compared with Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). It is observed that ELMNN-based load forecasting model produces superior results over other ANN-based models. © 2015 IEEE.;"Artificial neural network; Deregulation; Electricity planning; Load forecasting";"Commerce; Complex networks; Deregulation; Economics; Electric load dispatching; Electric power plant loads; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Radial basis function networks; Deregulated electricity market; Economic load dispatch; Elman neural network; Load forecasting; Load forecasting model; Power system planning; Radial basis function neural networks; Short term load forecasting; Electric load forecasting";5;1;1;1
Ziel F., Steinert R., Husmann S.;Forecasting day ahead electricity spot prices: The impact of the EXAA to other European electricity markets;2015;Energy Economics;22;In our paper we analyze the relationship between the day-ahead electricity price of the Energy Exchange Austria (EXAA) and other day-ahead electricity prices in Europe. We focus on markets, which settle their prices after the EXAA, which enables traders to include the EXAA price into their calculations. For each market we employ econometric models to incorporate the EXAA price and compare them with their counterparts without the price of the Austrian exchange. By employing a forecasting study, we find that electricity price models can be improved when EXAA prices are considered. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.;"Electricity price; European electricity markets; EXAA AR-Model; Forecasting";"Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; AR models; Day-ahead; Econometric model; Electricity market; Electricity price model; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Energy exchanges; Power markets; econometrics; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; price determination; price dynamics; Europe";4;1;1;1
Clements A.E., Herrera R., Hurn A.S.;Modelling interregional links in electricity price spikes;2015;Energy Economics;14;Abnormally high price spikes in spot electricity markets represent a significant risk to market participants. As such, a literature has developed that focuses on forecasting the probability of such spike events, moving beyond simply forecasting the level of price. Many univariate time series models have been proposed to deal with spikes within an individual market region. This paper is the first to develop a multivariate self-exciting point process model for dealing with price spikes across connected regions in the Australian National Electricity Market. The importance of the physical infrastructure connecting the regions on the transmission of spikes is examined. It is found that spikes are transmitted between the regions, and the size of spikes is influenced by the available transmission capacity. It is also found that improved risk estimates are obtained when inter-regional linkages are taken into account. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.;"Electricity prices; Hawkes process; Peaks over threshold; Point process; Price spikes; Transmission capacity";"Commerce; Power markets; Electricity prices; Peaks over threshold; Point process; Price spike; Transmission capacities; Costs; electricity generation; energy market; multivariate analysis; price determination; price dynamics; threshold; Australia";2, 4;1;1;0
Vaccaro A., El-Fouly T.H.M., Canizares C.A., Bhattacharya K.;Local Learning-ARIMA adaptive hybrid architecture for hourly electricity price forecasting;2015;2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech, PowerTech 2015;7;The paper proposes a hybrid architecture for electricity price forecasting. The proposed architecture combines the advantages of the easy-to-use and relatively easy-to-tune Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and the approximation power of local learning techniques. The architecture is robust and more accurate than the individual forecasting methodologies on which it is based, since it combines a reliable built-in linear model (ARIMA) with an adaptive dynamic corrector (Lazy Learning algorithm). The corrector model is sequentially updated, in order to adapt the whole architecture to varying market conditions.

However, the time series of electricity price has nonlinear, non-stationary and volatile behaviour and so its forecast method should have high learning capability to extract the complex input/output mapping function of electricity price. In this paper, a Combinatorial Neural Network (CNN) based forecasting engine is proposed to predict the future values of price data. The CNN-based forecasting engine is equipped with a new training mechanism for optimizing the weights of the CNN. This training mechanism is based on an efficient stochastic search method, which is a modified version of chemical reaction optimization algorithm, giving high learning ability to the CNN. The proposed price forecast strategy is tested on the real-world electricity markets of Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) and mainland Spain and its obtained results are extensively compared with the results obtained from several other forecast methods. These comparisons illustrate effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Grossi L., Nan F.;Robust smooth transition threshold autoregressive models for electricity prices;2015;International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM;3;In this paper we suggest the use of robust STAR (Smooth Transition AutoRegressive) processes to model and forecast electricity prices observed on deregulated markets. The robustness of the model is achieved by extending to time series the M-type estimator based on the polynomial weighting function first introduced for independent multivariate data. The robust M-STAR estimator can be considered as a generalization of the robust SETAR estimator [1], because in STAR processes the change from one regime to another is ruled by a smooth function rather than by a fixed threshold. The main advantage of estimating robust STAR models is the possibility to capture two very well-known stylized facts of electricity prices: nonlinearity produced by changes of regimes and the presence of sudden spikes due to inelasticity of demand. The forecasting performance of the model is assessed through an application to the Italian electricity market (IPEX). By means of prediction performance indexes and tests, robust and non-robust STAR models for electricity prices are compared. © 2015 IEEE.;"Electricity prices; Extreme values; M-estimator; Nonlinear models; Smooth Transition AutoRegressive processes";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Estimation; Forecasting; Power markets; Auto regressive process; Electricity prices; Extreme value; M-estimators; Non-linear model; Power quality";4;1;1;1

In addition, the fast response time of the system enabled its encapsulation in a PowerTAC agent, competing in a real time environment. The system displayed robust all-around performance in a plethora of real and simulated energy markets, each characterized by unique patterns and deviations. The low forecasting error, real time performance and the significant increase in the profitability of an energy market agent show that our approach is a powerful prediction tool, with multiple expansion possibilities. © 2015 IEEE.;"Load Forecasting; Neural Networks; Parallel architectures; Particle swarm optimization; Price Forecasting; Wavelet Neural Networks";"Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Neural networks; Optimization; Parallel architectures; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power transformers; Profitability; Fast response time; Load forecasting; Parallel implementations; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Price forecasting; Real time performance; Real-time environment; Wavelet neural networks; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Koban V., Zlatar I., Pantoš M., Omladič M.;A remark on forecasting spikes in electricity prices;2015;International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM;4;This paper presents a hybrid model for electricity price forecasting with focus on price spikes predictions. Nowadays, short-term forecasts have become increasingly important since the rise of the competitive spot electricity markets. A two-layered model is introduced for forecasting 7-days ahead hourly electricity price values of electricity spot market. Due to the importance of improved analysis of spikes for risk management, price segmentation into normal range and price spike module is applied. Price spike module consists of two segments: obtaining the probability of price spike occurrence and predicting the value of price spike. To avoid reliance on a single classifier, the compound classifier is proposed in the paper, which combines three individual classification methods: a support vector machine (SVM) classification, decision trees (DT) and probabilistic artificial neural network (PANN). The k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is applied for the price spike value prediction. © 2015 IEEE.;"Classification algorithms; Electricity price forecast; Nearest neighbor searches; Price spikes; Wavelet coefficients";"Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Forecasting; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Risk assessment; Risk management; Support vector machines; Classification algorithm; Classification methods; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity spot market; Price spike; Spot electricity market; Wavelet coefficients; Power markets";5;2;1;2

Nowakowska L.;Dynamic discrete model for electricity price forecasting;2015;IYCE 2015 - Proceedings: 2015 5th International Youth Conference on Energy;4;Price in the wholesale energy markets is established by matching supply (what generators want to sell) and demand (what utilities and customers want to buy). Developing the proper pricing strategies is becoming increasingly relevant to producers and consumers in the new competitive electric power markets. Price-forecasting tools are essential for all market participants for their survival under new deregulated environment. The goal of this paper is to construct a discrete dynamic model which can be used to forecast energy price in this kind of market. This mathematical model consists of four recursive, first-order equations describing current demand, forecasted demand and amount of energy being produced by generators. Based on this model the price for the next period can be calculated. The basic concepts such as changes of supply and demand and their influence on the market are firstly listed and described. It is also shown that this model is universal and providing necessary data can be applied to different energy market. © 2015 IEEE.;"day-ahead electricity market; demand forecasting; dynamic discrete model; price forecasting";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Day-ahead electricity market; Demand forecasting; Deregulated environments; Discrete dynamic models; Discrete modeling; Electricity price forecasting; Price forecasting; Wholesale energy market; Power markets";1;1;1;1
Brijs T., De Vos K., De Jonghe C., Belmans R.;Statistical analysis of negative prices in European balancing markets;2015;Renewable Energy;25;"The presence of renewable power generation technologies increases the need for system flexibility due to their variable nature. The increasing share of variable renewables in European power systems create a downward adequacy problem, which deals with the ability of power systems to cope with periods of excess generation. The occurrence of negative prices on Central Western European electricity markets confirms the relevance of this issue, which is referred to as ""incompressibility of power systems"" and is assessed as a barrier for further renewable power integration. The objective of this article is to identify the main drivers of negative price periods in European balancing markets, by means of both an empirical and regression analysis. Results confirm a positive relation with the scheduled generation of renewables and inflexible base load, as well as a negative relation with the scheduled system load. Furthermore, the occurrence of negative prices is related to the positive and negative forecast error of renewable generation and demand, respectively. It is concluded that negative balancing market prices provide a market signal for investments in flexibility sources such as flexible generation, demand response, electricity storage, and interconnector capacity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.";"Balancing market; Electricity prices; Market design; Negative prices; Renewable energy";"Commerce; Costs; Electric energy storage; Investments; Regression analysis; Balancing market; Electricity prices; Market design; Negative prices; Renewable energies; Power markets; investment; market system; power generation; price dynamics; regression analysis; renewable resource; statistical analysis; Western Europe";4;0;3;0

Kim M.-K.;A new approach to short-term price forecast strategy with an artificial neural network approach: Application to the Nord Pool;2015;Journal of Electrical Engineering and Technology;6;In new deregulated electricity market, short-term price forecasting is key information for all market players. A better forecast of market-clearing price (MCP) helps market participants to strategically set up their bidding strategies for energy markets in the short-term. This paper presents a new prediction strategy to improve the need for more accurate short-term price forecasting tool at spot market using an artificial neural networks (ANNs). To build the forecasting ANN model, a threelayered feedforward neural network trained by the improved Levenberg-marquardt (LM) algorithm is used to forecast the locational marginal prices (LMPs). To accurately predict LMPs, actual power generation and load are considered as the input sets, and then the difference is used to predict price differences in the spot market. The proposed ANN model generalizes the relationship between the LMP in each area and the unconstrained MCP during the same period of time. The LMP calculation is iterated so that the capacity between the areas is maximized and the mechanism itself helps to relieve grid congestion. The addition of flow between the areas gives the LMPs a new equilibrium point, which is balanced when taking the transfer capacity into account, LMP forecasting is then possible. The proposed forecasting strategy is tested on the spot market of the Nord Pool. The validity, the efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed approach are shown by comparing with time-series models. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.;"Artificial neural network; Levenberg-marquardt algorithm; Locational marginal price; Nord pool; Short-term forecasting";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Feedforward neural networks; Lakes; Neural networks; Power markets; Artificial neural network approach; Deregulated electricity market; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Locational marginal prices; Nord pool; Short-term forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Three-layered feedforward neural networks; Forecasting";5;1;1;1
Raviv E., Bouwman K.E., van Dijk D.;Forecasting day-ahead electricity prices: Utilizing hourly prices;2015;Energy Economics;48;The daily average price of electricity represents the price of electricity to be delivered over the full next day and serves as a key reference price in the electricity market. It is an aggregate that equals the average of hourly prices for delivery during each of the 24 individual hours. This paper demonstrates that the disaggregated hourly prices contain useful predictive information for the daily average price in the Nord Pool market. Multivariate models for the full panel of hourly prices significantly outperform univariate models of the daily average price, with reductions in Root Mean Squared Error of up to 16%. Substantial care is required in order to achieve these forecast improvements. Rich multivariate models are needed to exploit the relations between different hourly prices, but the risk of overfitting must be mitigated by using dimension reduction techniques, shrinkage and forecast combinations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.;"Dimension reduction; Electricity market; Forecast combinations; Forecasting; Hourly prices; Shrinkage";"Commerce; Electric industry; Forecasting; Mean square error; Power markets; Shrinkage; Dimension reduction; Dimension reduction techniques; Electricity market; Forecast combinations; Forecast improvements; Hourly prices; Predictive information; Root mean squared errors; Costs; electricity supply; error analysis; forecasting method; multivariate analysis; numerical model; price determination";3, 4;1;1;1
Garciá-Martos C., Caro E., Jesús Sánchez M.;Electricity price forecasting accounting for renewable energies: Optimal combined forecasts;2015;Journal of the Operational Research Society;2;Electricity price forecasting is an interesting problem for all the agents involved in electricity market operation. For instance, every profit maximisation strategy is based on the computation of accurate one-day-ahead forecasts, which is why electricity price forecasting has been a growing field of research in recent years. In addition, the increasing concern about environmental issues has led to a high penetration of renewable energies, particularly wind. In some European countries such as Spain, Germany and Denmark, renewable energy is having a deep impact on the local power markets. In this paper, we propose an optimal model from the perspective of forecasting accuracy, and it consists of a combination of several univariate and multivariate time series methods that account for the amount of energy produced with clean energies, particularly wind and hydro, which are the most relevant renewable energy sources in the Iberian Market. This market is used to illustrate the proposed methodology, as it is one of those markets in which wind power production is more relevant in terms of its percentage of the total demand, but of course our method can be applied to any other liberalised power market. As far as our contribution is concerned, first, the methodology proposed by Garciá-Martos et al (2007 and 2012) is generalised twofold: we allow the incorporation of wind power production and hydro reservoirs, and we do not impose the restriction of using the same model for 24 h. A computational experiment and a Design of Experiments (DOE) are performed for this purpose. Then, for those hours in which there are two or more models without statistically significant differences in terms of their forecasting accuracy, a combination of forecasts is proposed by weighting the best models (according to the DOE) and minimising the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAPE is the most popular accuracy metric for comparing electricity price forecasting models. We construct the combination of forecasts by solving several nonlinear optimisation problems that allow computation of the optimal weights for building the combination of forecasts. The results are obtained by a large computational experiment that entails calculating out-of-sample forecasts for every hour in every day in the period from January 2007 to December 2009. In addition, to reinforce the value of our methodology, we compare our results with those that appear in recent published works in the field. This comparison shows the superiority of our methodology in terms of forecasting accuracy. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Shayeghi H., Ghasemi A., Moradzadeh M., Nooshyar M.;Simultaneous day-ahead forecasting of electricity price and load in smart grids;2015;Energy Conversion and Management;61;In smart grids, customers are promoted to change their energy consumption patterns by electricity prices. In fact, in this environment, the electricity price and load consumption are highly corrected such that the market participants will have complex model in their decisions to maximize their profit. Although the available forecasting mythologies perform well in electricity market by way of little or no load and price interdependencies, but cannot capture load and price dynamics if they exist. To overcome this shortage, a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model is presented which can consider the correlation between electricity price and load. The proposed model consists of three components known as a Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) to make valuable subsets, Generalized Mutual Information (GMI) to select best input candidate and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) based on MIMO model, called LSSVM-MIMO, to make simultaneous load and price forecasts. Moreover, the LSSVM-MIMO parameters are optimized by a novel Quasi-Oppositional Artificial Bee Colony (QOABC) algorithm. Some forecasting indices based on error factor are considered to evaluate the forecasting accuracy. Simulations carried out on New York Independent System Operator, New South Wales (NSW) and PJM electricity markets data, and showing that the proposed hybrid algorithm has good potential for simultaneous forecasting of electricity price and load. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Prediction intervals (PIs) are statistical tools which quantify the uncertainty related to forecasts by estimating the ranges of the future electricity prices. Traditional approaches based on neural networks (NNs) generate PIs at the cost of high computational burden and doubtful assumptions about data distributions. In this work, we propose a novel technique that is not plagued with the above limitations and it generates high-quality PIs in a short time. The proposed method directly generates the lower and upper bounds of the future electricity prices using support vector machines (SVM). Optimal model parameters are obtained by the minimization of a modified PI-based objective function using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated using data from Ontario, Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection day-ahead and real-time markets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.;"Electricity market; Particle swarm optimization; Prediction interval; Support vector machines; Uncertainty";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Power markets; Statistical mechanics; Support vector machines; Uncertainty analysis; Computational burden; Electricity market; Lower and upper bounds; Neural networks (NNS); Objective functions; Prediction interval; Traditional approaches; Uncertainty; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)";5;1;1;2
Kalczynski P., Zerom D.;Price forecast valuation for the nyiso electricity market;2015;Kybernetes;;Purpose – Following the deregulation of electricity markets in the USA, independent power producers operate as for-profit entities. Their profit depends on the price of electricity and an accurate forecast is critical in making bidding decisions on the electricity and reserve markets or engaging in bilateral contracts. Competing price forecasts have their accuracy expressed in statistical terms but producers need to determine the long-term value of using a given forecast. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue by presenting a method of electricity price forecast valuation which compares forecast models using financial rather than statistical measures. Design/methodology/approach – The objectives of this paper are achieved by mathematical modeling of thermal power plants and price forecast information available to market participants and simulating the operation of a thermal power plant using various price forecasts and perfect information (as a baseline). The operating profit calculated over a long period was used for ranking forecast models. Findings – The framework can be used to estimate the value of a new price forecast as well as to determine if potential gains from developing or acquiring a new forecast will justify the expenses. The results show that an improvement in terms of statistical forecast accuracy measures does not guarantee increased profit. Practical implications – This paper presents a new method for comparing electricity price forecast models. It can be adapted to various types of thermal power plants that operate on liberalized electricity markets and utilize price-based dynamic economic dispatch models. Originality/value – This paper presents a simulation-based valuation framework for short-term electricity price. The approach described in this paper can be utilized by independent power producers for different types of generators, operating on deregulated electricity markets. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Decision making; Modelling; Simulation; System dynamics";"Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Deregulation; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Models; Power markets; Profitability; Scheduling; Thermoelectric power plants; Deregulated electricity market; Design/methodology/approach; Dynamic economic dispatch; Independent power producers; Liberalized electricity market; Perfect informations; Simulation; System Dynamics; Electric load dispatching";1;1;1;1

In this paper, we propose a new direct time series forecasting method based on clustering and next symbol prediction. First, the cluster label sequence is obtained from time series clustering. Then a lossless compression algorithm of prediction by partial match version C coder (PPMC) is applied on this obtained discrete cluster label sequence to predict the next cluster label. Finally, the whole time series values of one-step-ahead can be directly forecast from the predicted cluster label. The proposed method is evaluated on electricity time series datasets, and the numerical experiments show that the proposed method can achieve promising results in day-ahead electricity load and price forecasting. © 2014 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.;"Clustering; Next symbol prediction; Time series forecasting";"C (programming language); Costs; Forecasting; Numerical methods; Time series; Clustering; Competitive electricity markets; Lossless compression algorithm; Numerical experiments; Prediction by partial matches; Price forecasting; Time series clustering; Time series forecasting; Electric load forecasting";−1;−1;−1;−1
Jin C.H., Pok G., Lee Y., Park H.-W., Kim K.D., Yun U., Ryu K.H.;A SOM clustering pattern sequence-based next symbol prediction method for day-ahead direct electricity load and price forecasting;2015;Energy Conversion and Management;34;In this paper, we propose a new day-ahead direct time series forecasting method for competitive electricity markets based on clustering and next symbol prediction. In the clustering step, pattern sequence and their topology relations are obtained from self organizing map time series clustering. In the next symbol prediction step, with each cluster label in the pattern sequence represented as a pair of its topologically identical coordinates, artificial neural network is used to predict the topological coordinates of next day by training the relationship between previous daily pattern sequence and its next day pattern. According to the obtained topology relations, the nearest nonzero hits pattern is assigned to next day so that the whole time series values can be directly forecasted from the assigned cluster pattern. The proposed method was evaluated on Spanish, Australian and New York electricity markets and compared with PSF and some of the most recently published forecasting methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the best forecasting methods at least 3.64%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Intan Azmira W.A.R., Izham Z.A., Keem Siah Y., Titik Khawa A.R.;Feature selection and parameter optimization with GA-LSSVM in electricity price forecasting;2015;Journal of Electrical Engineering;1;Forecasting price has now become essential task in the operation of electrical power system. Power producers and customers use short term price forecasts to manage and plan for bidding approaches, and hence increasing the utility's profit and energy efficiency as well. The main challenge in forecasting electricity price is when dealing with non-stationary and high volatile price series. Some of the factors influencing this volatility are load behavior, weather, fuel price and transaction of import and export due to long term contract. This paper proposes the use of Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization technique to predict daily electricity prices in Ontario. The selection of input data and LSSVM's parameter held by GA are proven to improve accuracy as well as efficiency of prediction. A comparative study of proposed approach with other techniques and previous research was conducted in term of forecast accuracy, where the results indicate that (1) the LSSVM with GA outperforms other methods of LSSVM and Neural Network (NN), (2) the optimization algorithm of GA gives better accuracy than Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and cross validation. However, future study should emphasize on improving forecast accuracy during spike event since Ontario power market is reported as among the most volatile market worldwide.;"Electricity price forecasting; Genetic Algorithm (GA); Least square support vector machine (LSSVM); Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)";;5;2, 3;1;1

Monteiro C., Fernandez-Jimenez L.a., Ramirez-Rosado I.J.;Explanatory information analysis for day-ahead price forecasting in the Iberian electricity market;2015;Energies;19;This paper presents the analysis of the importance of a set of explanatory (input) variables for the day-ahead price forecast in the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). The available input variables include extensive hourly time series records of weather forecasts, previous prices, and regional aggregation of power generations and power demands. The paper presents the comparisons of the forecasting results achieved with a model which includes all these available input variables (EMPF model) with respect to those obtained by other forecasting models containing a reduced set of input variables. These comparisons identify the most important variables for forecasting purposes. In addition, a novel Reference Explanatory Model for Price Estimations (REMPE) that achieves hourly price estimations by using actual power generations and power demands of such day is described in the paper, which offers the lowest limit for the forecasting error of the EMPF model. All the models have been implemented using the same technique (artificial neural networks) and have been satisfactorily applied to the real-world case study of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). The relative importance of each explanatory variable is identified for the day-ahead price forecasts in the MIBEL. The comparisons also allow outlining guidelines of the value of the different types of input information. © 2015 by the authors.;"Electricity prices; Iberian electricity market; Market prices; Short-term forecasting";"Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric power utilization; Neural networks; Weather forecasting; Day-ahead price forecasts; Electricity prices; Explanatory variables; Forecasting models; Forecasting purpose; Iberian electricity market; Market price; Short-term forecasting; Power markets";5;1;1;1

Kim M.K.;Short-term price forecasting of Nordic power market by combination Levenberg-Marquardt and Cuckoo search algorithms;2015;IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution;28;This study proposes a new forecasting method for short-term spot prices in the Nordic power market. It proposes a Cuckoo search Levenberg-Marquardt (CSLM)-trained, CSLM feed-forward neural network (CSLM-FFNN) for the solving process that combines the improved Levenberg Marquardt and Cuckoo search algorithms. The proposed model considers actual power generation and system load as input sets to facilitate the efficient use of both transmission and power generation resources by direct market participants. During the training, the proposed CSLM-FFNN model generalises the relationship between the area prices and the system price for the same period. The model can be updated to track online the variation trend of the electricity price and to maintain accuracy because of the rapid training speed in CSLM learning algorithm. The developed model is tested with publicly available data acquired from the Nord Pool, and the model's performance is compared with state-of-the-art artificial neural networks and time-series models. Besides, the proposed approach is applied to forecast market-clearing price in the Spanish electricity market, to further assess the validity of the approach. The results show that the proposed CSLM-FFNN exhibits superior performance than other methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and training efficiency.;;"Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Optimization; Cuckoo search algorithms; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting methods; Levenberg-Marquardt; Market Clearing Price; Nordic power markets; Short-term price forecasting; Spanish electricity markets; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Darudi A., Bashari M., Javidi M.H.;Electricity price forecasting using a new data fusion algorithm;2015;IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution;12;Accurate price forecasting is crucial for all market participants in electricity markets. This study presents a hybrid price forecasting framework based on a new data fusion algorithm. Owing to the complexity and distinct nature of the electricity price, a single forecast engine cannot capture all different patterns of the price signals. Hence, this study focuses on a hybrid forecasting method to extract the advantages of several forecasting engines. In the proposed method, artificial neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and autoregressive moving average are employed as primary forecast engines (agents) which provide three independent price forecasts. Then, a new data fusion algorithm, the modified ordered weighted average (modified OWA), is proposed to combine the three forecasts to generate a single unified price forecast. Hopefully, the fusion's output outperforms all the agents' forecasts. The author's proposed fusion algorithm, unlike conventional OWA, uses the feedback from the agents' error. The proposed framework is evaluated on the Spanish electricity market. The results confirm the ability of the proposed fusion framework to provide more accurate forecasts compared with the input agents forecasts. Results are also compared with some of the recent electricity price forecasting methods. © 2015 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.;;"Algorithms; Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Data fusion; Engines; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Autoregressive moving average; Data fusion algorithm; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Market participants; Ordered weighted average; Spanish electricity markets; Power markets";5;1;1;1

Zhou H., Tang F., Ye X., Jia J.;The dynamic model and prediction research on electricity forward price in competitive power market;2015;Journal of Computational Information Systems;;In competitive electricity market, the accurate forecast of electricity forward price can provide guidance for bidding strategies of market participants and reference for power generation project, which will optimize the power suppliers' investment portfolio in significant measure. More importantly, participants are risk averse, and they can stabilize their income by electricity forward forecasting. Electricity forward price is affected by real-time electricity price, interest rate, the influence of load demand or other factors, which makes it difficult to establish an accurate mathematical model for a comprehensive description. Aiming at this point, the Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) prediction algorithm is proposed for dynamic model establishment and prediction research of the electricity forward price, which is obtained from the Nordic electricity market in this paper.

Kim M.-K.;A new approach to short-term price forecast strategy with an artificial neural network approach: Application to the nord pool;2015;Journal of Electrical Engineering and Technology;3;In new deregulated electricity market, short-term price forecasting is key information for all market players. A better forecast of market-clearing price (MCP) helps market participants to strategically set up their bidding strategies for energy markets in the short-term. This paper presents a new prediction strategy to improve the need for more accurate short-term price forecasting tool at spot market using an artificial neural networks (ANNs). To build the forecasting ANN model, a threelayered feedforward neural network trained by the improved Levenberg-marquardt (LM) algorithm is used to forecast the locational marginal prices (LMPs). To accurately predict LMPs, actual power generation and load are considered as the input sets, and then the difference is used to predict price differences in the spot market. The proposed ANN model generalizes the relationship between the LMP in each area and the unconstrained MCP during the same period of time. The LMP calculation is iterated so that the capacity between the areas is maximized and the mechanism itself helps to relieve grid congestion. The addition of flow between the areas gives the LMPs a new equilibrium point, which is balanced when taking the transfer capacity into account, LMP forecasting is then possible. The proposed forecasting strategy is tested on the spot market of the Nord Pool. The validity, the efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed approach are shown by comparing with time-series models. © 2015 The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.;"Artificial neural network; Levenbergmarquardt algorithm; Locational marginal price; Nord pool; Short-term forecasting";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Feedforward neural networks; Lakes; Neural networks; Power markets; Artificial neural network approach; Deregulated electricity market; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Locational marginal prices; Nord pool; Short-term forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Three-layered feedforward neural networks; Forecasting";−1;−1;−1;−1

Additionally, the model is able to reproduce spikes and negative prices. We distinguish between a base regime as well as upper and lower spike regimes. We derive hourly price forward curves for EEX Phelix, and together with historical hourly spot prices, historical hourly price forward curves are the basis for model calibration.

Nowotarski J., Raviv E., Trück S., Weron R.;An empirical comparison of alternative schemes for combining electricity spot price forecasts;2014;Energy Economics;60;In this comprehensive empirical study we critically evaluate the use of forecast averaging in the context of electricity prices. We apply seven averaging and one selection scheme and perform a backtesting analysis on day-ahead electricity prices in three major European and US markets. Our findings support the additional benefit of combining forecasts of individual methods for deriving more accurate predictions, however, the performance is not uniform across the considered markets and periods. In particular, equally weighted pooling of forecasts emerges as a simple, yet powerful technique compared with other schemes that rely on estimated combination weights, but only when there is no individual predictor that consistently outperforms its competitors. Constrained least squares regression (CLS) offers a balance between robustness against such well performing individual methods and relatively accurate forecasts, on average better than those of the individual predictors. Finally, some popular forecast averaging schemes - like ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) - turn out to be unsuitable for predicting day-ahead electricity prices. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;"ARX model; Constrained least squares regression; Day-ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combination";"Bayesian networks; Commerce; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Least squares approximations; Regression analysis; ARX model; Constrained least squares; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combinations; Forecasting; Bayesian analysis; electricity supply; forecasting method; least squares method; market conditions; price determination; regression analysis; Europe; United States";3, 4;1;1;1
Voronin S., Partanen J.;Forecasting electricity price and demand using a hybrid approach based on wavelet transform, ARIMA and neural networks;2014;International Journal of Energy Research;42;Demand and price forecasting are extremely important for participants in energy markets. Most research work in the area predicts demand and price signals separately. In this paper, a model is presented which predicts electricity demand and price simultaneously. The model combines wavelet transforms, ARIMA models and neural networks. Both time domain and wavelet domain variables are considered in the feature set for price and demand forecasting. The best input set is selected by two-step correlation analysis. The proposed model is better adapted to real conditions of an energy market since the forecast features for price and demand are not assumed as known values but are predicted by the model, thus accounting for the interactions of the demand and price forecast processes. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using data from the Finnish energy market, which is part of the Nordic Power Pool. The results show that the proposed model provides significant improvement in both demand and price prediction accuracy compared with models using a separate frameworks approach. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;"Energy markets; Hybrid forecast method; Price and demand forecasts; Two-step feature selection; Wavelet transform";"Correlation analysis; Demand forecast; Demand forecasting; Electricity demands; Energy markets; Forecast accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Hybrid forecast method; Commerce; Forecasting; Neural networks; Wavelet transforms; Costs";4, 5;1;1;1

The approach captures the dependency of electricity prices on covariates, such as demand for electricity, amount of energy produced by intermittent sources, and weather-dependent variables. To obtain parsimonious models, principal component analysis is used for dimension reduction. The approach is tested on two data sets from different markets and its performance is analyzed in terms of fit, forecast quality, and computational efficiency. The results are encouraging, in that the proposed method leads to a good in-sample fit and performs well out-of-sample compared with four benchmark models, including a SARIMA model as well as a functional nonparametric regression approach recently proposed in the literature. © 2014 IIE.;"Electricity markets; generalized linear models; price forecasting; single index models; statistical modeling";"Electricity market; Generalized linear model; Price forecasting; Single index models; Statistical modeling; Costs; Forecasting; Principal component analysis; Electricity";4;1;1;1

Since the system load is one of the important factors affecting electricity price changes, a two-factorial model based on fuzzy time series is presented in this paper for electricity price forecasting using the electricity prices of the previous days and the system load. In the proposed method, price and system load time series are fuzzified by fuzzy sets created based on the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm.

Agarwal A., Ojha A., Tewari S.C., Tripathi M.M.;Hourly load and price forecasting using ANN and fourier analysis;2014;Proceedings of 6th IEEE Power India International Conference, PIICON 2014;4;Forecasting is an important tool that enables the decision makers to understand the current market trends and plan the system accordingly. Load and Price Forecasting are two such important tools in the electricity market that help in performing essential tasks such as unit commitment of generating capacity, resource planning, cash flow analysis for stakeholders etc. This paper presents a new ANN model for hourly load and price forecasting. Since there are variations in demand throughout the day, a model needs to be devised to predict these variations. In this paper, Fourier analysis of the load and price signal has been done to find out the dominant features of these signals. These features are then fed to a Multi-layer Feed Forward Neural Network. The ANN model is trained on hourly data from ISO New England electricity market from the year 2007 to 2011 and tested on out-of-sample data from the year 2012. Results obtained from simulation show that the proposed model works well in both Load and Price Forecasting and the value of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is obtained is minimum compared to other methods. © 2014 IEEE.;"Artificial Neural Network; Fourier analysis; Mean absolute percentage error; New ISO England market";"Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Electric industry; Forecasting; Fourier analysis; Fourier transforms; Neural networks; Cash flow analysis; Electricity market; England; Generating capacity; Mean absolute percentage error; Multilayer feedforward neural networks; Price forecasting; Resource planning; Power markets";5;1, 2;1;1
Sahay K.B., Tripathi M.M.;An analysis of short-term price forecasting of power market by using ANN;2014;Proceedings of 6th IEEE Power India International Conference, PIICON 2014;4;In deregulated power markets, forecasting electricity parameters are most essential tasks and basis for any decision making. Price forecasting in competitive electricity markets is critical for consumers and producers in planning their operations and managing their price risk, and it also plays a key role in the economic optimization of the electric energy industry. Accurate, short-term price forecasting is an essential instrument which provides crucial information for power producers and consumers to develop accurate bidding strategies in order to maximize their profit. In this paper artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in short-term price forecasting that is, the day-ahead hourly forecast of the electricity market price. A new artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to compute the forecasted price in ISO New England market using MATLAB R13. The data used in the forecasting are hourly historical data of the temperature, electricity load and natural gas price of ISO New England market. The simulation results have shown highly accurate day-ahead forecasts with very small error in price forecasting. © 2014 IEEE.;"Day ahead electricity price forecast; locational marginal price (LMP); mean absolute error (MAE); mean absolute percentage error (MAPE); neural network (NN); power system; short-term price forecasting";"Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Deregulation; Errors; Forecasting; MATLAB; Natural gas; Neural networks; Electricity prices; Locational marginal prices; Mean absolute error; Mean absolute percentage error; Neural network (nn); power system; Short-term price forecasting; Power markets";5;1;1;1
Mori H., Nakano K.;Application of Gaussian process to locational marginal pricing forecasting;2014;Procedia Computer Science;3;In this paper, a new method is proposed for Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) forecasting in Smart Grid. The marginal cost is required to supply electricity to incremental loads in case where a certain node increases power demands in a balanced power system. LMP plays an important role to maintain economic efficiency in power markets in a way that electricity flows from a low-cost area to high-cost one and the transmission network congestion is alleviated. The power market players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their desire is reflected. This paper presents the Gaussian Process (GP) technique that comes from the extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in a way that hierarchical Bayesian estimation is introduced to express the model parameter as the stochastic variables. The advantage is that the model accuracy of GP is better than others. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of ISONE(Independent System Operator New England) in USA. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.;"Gaussian process; Hierarchical bayes model; Locational marginal price; Mahalanobis kernel; MAP estimation; Time series";"Bayesian networks; Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Location; Power markets; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Time series; Adaptive systems; Gaussian Processes; Hierarchical Bayes models; Locational marginal prices; Mahalanobis; MAP estimation; Electric power transmission networks";4, 5;1;1;2
Akyildirim E., Göncü A., Altarovici A.;Modeling long-term seasonality and spikes of the spot electricity prices in Turkey;2014;Bogazici Journal;0;"Stochastic models of electricity spot prices depend on price spikes and long-term seasonality. Therefore it is crucial to determine suitable methods for the identification of price spikes and the modeling of long-term seasonal components (LTSC). Following recent studies (Janczura and Weron, 2010; Janczura et al., 2013), we compare the proportion of observations identified as outliers for five different outlier detection methods and three approaches to long-term seasonality modeling. After removing the effects of outliers, we compare the out-of-sample forecasting performance for three categories of long-term seasonality models: dummies, Fourier series, and wavelet-based methods. We consider various combinations of each approach and perform a comprehensive backtesting comparison at different forecasting horizons for the recently liberalized Turkish electricity market.";"Electricity price spikes; Long-term seasonality modeling; Turkish electricity prices; Wavelets";"electricity supply; energy market; modeling; price determination; seasonality; stochasticity; wavelet analysis; Turkey";4;3;1;2
Mei J., He D., Harley R., Habetler T., Qu G.;A random forest method for real-time price forecasting in New York electricity market;2014;IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting;13;This paper mainly focuses on the real-time price forecasting in New York electricity market through random forest. Accurate forecasting is regarded as the most practical way to win power bid in today's highly competitive electricity market. Comparing with existing price forecasting methods, random forest, as a newly introduced method, will provide a price probability distribution, which will allow the users to estimate the risks of their bidding strategy and also making the results helpful for later industrial using. Furthermore, the model can adjust to the latest forecasting condition, i.e. The latest climatic, seasonal and market condition, by updating the random forest parameters with new observations. This adaptability avoids the model failure in a climatic or economic condition different from the training set. A case study in New York HUD VL area is presented to evaluate the proposed model. © 2014 IEEE.;"electricity market; electricity price; NYISO; random forest";"Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Electric industry; Power markets; Probability distributions; Risk perception; Risks; Competitive electricity markets; Economic condition; Electricity market; Electricity prices; NYISO; Price forecasting; Random forest methods; Random forests; Forecasting";5;1;1;1
Wang Z., Liu F., Wu J., Wang J.;A hybrid forecasting model based on bivariate division and a backpropagation artificial neural network optimized by chaos particle swarm optimization for day-ahead electricity price;2014;Abstract and Applied Analysis;11;In the electricity market, the electricity price plays an inevitable role. Nevertheless, accurate price forecasting, a vital factor affecting both government regulatory agencies and public power companies, remains a huge challenge and a critical problem. Determining how to address the accurate forecasting problem becomes an even more significant task in an era in which electricity is increasingly important. Based on the chaos particle swarm optimization (CPSO), the backpropagation artificial neural network (BPANN), and the idea of bivariate division, this paper proposes a bivariate division BPANN (BD-BPANN) method and the CPSO-BD-BPANN method for forecasting electricity price. The former method creatively transforms the electricity demand and price to be a new variable, named DV, which is calculated using the division principle, to forecast the day-ahead electricity by multiplying the forecasted values of the DVs and forecasted values of the demand. Next, to improve the accuracy of BD-BPANN, chaos particle swarm optimization and BD-BPANN are synthesized to form a novel model, CPSO-BD-BPANN. In this study, CPSO is utilized to optimize the initial parameters of BD-BPANN to make its output more stable than the original model. Finally, two forecasting strategies are proposed regarding different situations. © 2014 Zhilong Wang et al.;;;4, 5;1;1;1
Wu L., Shahidehpour M.;A hybrid model for integrated day-ahead electricity price and load forecasting in smart grid;2014;IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution;37;Load and price forecasting are two key issues for market participants and system operators in electricity markets. Most existing works predict load and price separately. However, a dynamic pricing type scenario is envisioned in smart grid, where consumers may have the ability to react to constantly changing price signals by shifting electricity usages from expensive hours to others, which would consequently impact electricity prices. Thus, price and load signals are strongly coupled, and previous separated forecast models may not be as effective. In this study, a two-stage integrated price and load forecasting framework is developed. The first stage provides initial price and load forecasts separately, and the second stage considers load and price interaction with initial forecasts as inputs. At each stage, a hybrid time-series and adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) model is used, in which multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average catches the linear relationship of price and load log return series, generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic unveils heteroscedastic character of residuals and AWNN presents non-linear impacts. Several criteria such as average mean absolute percentage error and error variance are used to measure the forecasting accuracy. Illustrative forecasting examples of the New York Independent System Operator market are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed method. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.;;"Commerce; Costs; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Neural networks; Smart power grids; Adaptive wavelet neural network; Forecasting accuracy; Independent system operators; Linear relationships; Market participants; Mean absolute percentage error; Multivariate autoregressive; Price and load forecasting; Electric load forecasting";4, 5;1;1;1
Cervone A., Santini E., Teodori S., Romito D.Z.;Electricity price forecast: A comparison of different models to evaluate the single national price in the Italian energy exchange market;2014;International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy;6;In the last decades, electricity markets throughout the Eurozone have undergone substantial changes. The deregulation of electricity markets stimulated investments in the production and distribution of energy, but there are large risks associated with these investments due to price volatility. The paper in the introduction describes the algorithm that governs the operation of the Day- Ahead Market in the Italian Power Exchange and proposes an econometric model for short-term forecasting (six months or a year) of the daily Single National Price (Prezzo Unico Nazionale, PUN) of electricity. The model includes constants, regressors, moving averages, weekly and seasonal dummies, autoregressive and heteroschedastic variables. The results show a significant decrease in error of the short-term forecast of the analyzed time series, in comparison with the method of linear least squares, traditionally used in literature. An analysis on the influence of different variables on PUN such as brent, solar radiation and weather has been reported. A comparison of the different models with specific indices have been performed and discussed. © 2014 Econjournals.

Carpio J., Juan J., López D.;Multivariate exponential smoothing and dynamic factor model applied to hourly electricity price analysis;2014;Technometrics;9;Thanks to its very simple recursive computing scheme, exponential smoothing has become a popular technique to forecast time series. In this work, we show the advantages of its multivariate version and present some properties of the model, which allows us to perform a dynamic factor analysis. This analysis leads to a simple methodology to reduce the number of parameters (useful when the dimension of observations is large) via a linear transformation that decomposes the multivariate process into independent univariate exponential smoothing processes, characterized by a single smoothing parameter that goes from zero (white-noise process) to one (random walk process). A computer implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm has been built for the maximum likelihood estimation of the models. The practicality of the method is demonstrated by its application to hourly electricity price predictions in some day-ahead markets, such as Omel, Powernext, and Nord Pool markets, whose forecasts are given as examples.

Samitas A., Armenatzoglou A.;Regression tree model versus Markov regime switching: a comparison for electricity spot price modelling and forecasting;2014;Operational Research;9;This paper models electricity spot prices using a Markov regime switching (MRS) model and regression trees (RT). MRS models offer the possibility to divide the time series into different regimes with different underlying processes. RT is a data driven technique aiming in finding a classifier that performs an average guessing for the response variable in question, which is the short term electricity spot price. We use a dataset consisting of average day ahead spot electricity prices for the MRS model. Then, we use hourly data to build the RT model. The empirical evidence supports that the regression tree approach outperforms the MRS model. We also compare the forecasting accuracy of the regression tree model by incorporating different predictors sets for electricity prices and logarithmic electricity prices. We find that a model with 11 predictors, accounting for logarithmic prices fits best our data. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;"Electricity prices; Energy markets; Forecast performance; Non parametric; Parametric";;3, 4;1;1;1

These scenarios are most likely to be generated based on marginal predictive densities for such prices, then enhanced with a temporal dependence structure. A semi-parametric methodology for generating such densities is presented: it includes: (i) a time-adaptive quantile regression model for the 5%-95% quantiles; and (ii) a description of the distribution tails with exponential distributions. The forecasting skill of the proposed model is compared to that of four benchmark approaches and the well-known the generalist autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model over a three-year evaluation period. While all benchmarks are outperformed in terms of forecasting skill overall, the superiority of the semi-parametric model over the GARCH model lies in the former's ability to generate reliable quantile estimates. © 2014 by the authors.";"Density forecasting; Electricity prices; Non-stationarity; Quantile regression; Stochastic processes";"Costs; Decision making; Forecasting; Random processes; Regression analysis; Stochastic systems; Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Day-ahead electricity market; Density forecasting; Electricity prices; Exponential distributions; Non-stationarities; Quantile regression; Semi-parametric modeling; Power markets";4;1;1;2
Young D., Poletti S., Browne O.;Can agent-based models forecast spot prices in electricity markets? Evidence from the New Zealand electricity market;2014;Energy Economics;11;Modelling price formation in electricity markets is a notoriously difficult process, due to physical constraints on electricity generation and transmission, and the potential for market power. This difficulty has inspired the recent development of bottom-up agent-based algorithmic learning models of electricity markets. While these have proven quite successful in small models, few authors have attempted any validation of their model against real-world data in a more realistic model. In this paper we develop the SWEM model, where we take one of the most promising algorithms from the literature, a modified version of the Roth and Erev algorithm, and apply it to a 19-node simplification of the New Zealand electricity market. Once key variables such as water storage are accounted for, we show that our model can closely mimic short-run (weekly) electricity prices at these 19 nodes, given fundamental inputs such as fuel costs, network data, and demand. We show that agents in SWEM are able to manipulate market power when a line outage makes them an effective monopolist in the market. SWEM has already been applied to a wide variety of policy applications in the New Zealand market.22. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;"Agent-based modelling; Electricity markets; Power trading";"Computational methods; Costs; Digital storage; Electric industry; Fuel storage; Outages; Agent-based model; Agent-based modelling; Algorithmic learning; Electricity generation; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Physical constraints; Power trading; New zealand; Spot price; Commerce; algorithm; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; model validation; modeling; price dynamics; electricity generation; energy policy; New Zealand";1;1, 2;1;1

Frömmel M., Han X., Kratochvil S.;Modeling the daily electricity price volatility with realized measures;2014;Energy Economics;18;We propose using Realized GARCH-type models to estimate the daily price volatility in the EPEX power markets. The model specifications extract the volatility-related information from realized measures, which improves the in-sample fit of the data. More importantly, evidence on the out-of-sample predictability reinforces the value of the specifications, as the forecast quality is improved over the benchmark EGARCH model under eight conventional criteria. In particular, we show that the benefit of including intraday range as a realized measure is more substantial than realized variance. All the key findings are robust under rolling-window and recursive estimation schemes, Gaussian and skewed t-distribution assumptions on the innovation process, and alternative specifications on the predictable price component. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;"Electricity; Intraday range; Realized GARCH; Volatility forecasting";"Benchmarking; Electricity; Specifications; Electricity price volatilities; GARCH-type models; Innovation process; Intraday range; Model specifications; Realized GARCH; Recursive estimation schemes; Volatility forecasting; Costs; electricity generation; energy market; numerical model; prediction; price dynamics";4;1;1, 2;1
Cincotti S., Gallo G., Ponta L., Raberto M.;Modeling and forecasting of electricity spot-prices: Computational intelligence vs classical econometrics;2014;AI Communications;45;In European countries, the last decade has been characterized by a deregulation of power production and electricity became a commodity exchanged in proper markets. This resulted in an increasing interest of the scientific community on electricity exchanges for modeling both market activity and price process. This paper analyzes electricity spot-prices of the Italian Power Exchange (IPEX) and proposes three different methods to model prices time series: a discrete-time univariate econometric model (ARMA-GARCH) and two computational-intelligence techniques (Neural Network and Support Vector Machine). Price series exhibit a strong daily seasonality, addressed by analyzing separately a series for each of the 24 hours. One-day ahead forecasts of hourly prices have been considered so to compare the prediction performances of three different methods, with respect to the canonical benchmark model based on the random walk hypothesis. Results point out that Support Vector Machine methodology gives better forecasting accuracy for price time series, closely followed by the econometric technique. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

Cerjan M., Matijaš M., Delimar M.;Dynamic hybrid model for short-term electricity price forecasting;2014;Energies;24;Accurate forecasting tools are essential in the operation of electric power systems, especially in deregulated electricity markets. Electricity price forecasting is necessary for all market participants to optimize their portfolios. In this paper we propose a hybrid method approach for short-term hourly electricity price forecasting. The paper combines statistical techniques for pre-processing of data and a multi-layer (MLP) neural network for forecasting electricity price and price spike detection. Based on statistical analysis, days are arranged into several categories. Similar days are examined by correlation significance of the historical data. Factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including historical price factors, load factors and wind production factors are discussed. A price spike index (CWI) is defined for spike detection and forecasting. Using proposed approach we created several forecasting models of diverse model complexity. The method is validated using the European Energy Exchange (EEX) electricity price data records. Finally, results are discussed with respect to price volatility, with emphasis on the price forecasting accuracy. © 2014 by the authors.;"Data mining; Electricity price; Forecasting techniques; Neural network; Price volatility; Short term electricity price forecasting; Spot market";"Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Data mining; Deregulation; Electric power systems; Electric tools; Forecasting; Neural networks; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting techniques; Price volatility; Spot market; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1
Hayfavi A., Talasli I.;Stochastic multifactor modeling of spot electricity prices;2014;Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics;15;In this paper, a stochastic multifactor model is proposed for modeling of the daily spot market electricity prices. Stochastic part of the model is composed of three jump processes and a Brownian motion where two of the jump processes are assumed to be mean reverting with different mean reversion rates. The multistep algorithm proposed for model estimation utilizes an iterative threshold function (constructed on GARCH(1,1) volatility estimates) in separation of the jumps. The factor model is applied to Turkish day ahead electricity market. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed multifactor model, estimation results are also compared to the results acquired by application of mean reverting jump diffusion model of Cartea and Figueroa (2005) and Markov regime switching model of Janczura and Weron (2010) to the same data set. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Sahay K.B., Tripathi M.M.;Day ahead hourly load and price forecast in ISO New England market using ANN;2013;2013 Annual IEEE India Conference, INDICON 2013;7;In restructured daily power markets, forecasting electricity price and load are most essential tasks and basis for any decision making.

Using an accurate model for short-term price forecasting in the competitive environment of electric industry helps the market participants in investing and planning for short-term contracts and getting the maximum possible profit. In markets with Pay-as-Bid mechanism, such as Iran, the accurate forecasting of this factor is of great importance. Therefore, in this paper, the proposed model is applied on the price data of Iranian power market in 2013. In this model, first the input data is clustered by the fuzzy c-means technique. This makes it possible to separate the data based on the type of load or day of the year. Then, proper training data are used by the improved SVR network for short-term price forecasting. In this paper, the new Bat algorithm is used for optimizing the parameters of SVR network. Bat algorithm is a recent addition to the bio-inspired algorithms, considered as a new metaheuristic algorithm based on Bat behavior.

Nazer Kakhki I., Taherian H., Aghaebrahimi M.R.;Short-term price forecasting under high penetration of wind generation units in smart grid environment;2013;Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering, ICCKE 2013;5;With the emergence of smart grids, customers have become capable of reacting to the fluctuations in electricity price. Therefore, electricity price is a key element in optimum demand side management (DSM) in this environment. Accurate short-term forecasting of electricity price is of great importance for the market participants. However, due to the nonlinear, stochastic and time-variant nature of electricity price, accurate forecasting is extremely difficult. On the other hand, distributed generation resources, especially the wind, have widely penetrated these networks and the real time balancing of the demand and generation of power systems has become extremely complicated due to the variable nature of wind generation. In this paper, considering high penetration levels of wind generation, the short-term forecasting of electricity price is investigated based on the Nord Pool power market data. The main idea is based on presenting a hybrid model which consists of a multi-layer perceptron neural network and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) which uses a data clustering technique based on imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA).

Xie M., Sandels C., Zhu K., Nordstrom L.;A seasonal ARIMA model with exogenous variables for elspot electricity prices in Sweden;2013;International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM;10;In a spot market, price prediction plays an indispensable role in maximizing the benefit of a producer as well as optimizing the utility of a consumer. This paper develops a seasonal ARIMA model with exogenous variables (SARIMAX) to predict day-ahead electricity prices in Elspot market, the largest day-ahead market for power trading in the world. Compared with the basic ARIMA model, SARIMAX has two distinct features: 1) A seasonal component is introduced to cope with weekly effect on price fluctuations. 2) Exogenous variables that exert influence on electricity prices are incorporated to make price predictions in the context of an integrated energy market. A detailed implementation of SARIMAX for Elspot market in Sweden is presented. © 2013 IEEE.;"electricity market; exogenous variables; price prediction; Seasonal ARIMA model; time series";"Day ahead market; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Energy markets; Exogenous variables; Price fluctuation; Price prediction; Seasonal ARIMA models; Costs; Electricity; Forecasting; Time series; Commerce";4;1;1;1

We use half-hourly data from the UK power market to model the spot prices directly (via ARX and Vector ARX models) and indirectly (via factor models). The forecasting performance of five econometric models is evaluated and compared with that of a univariate model, which uses only (aggregated) daily data. The results indicate that there are forecast improvements from incorporating the disaggregated data, especially, when the forecast horizon exceeds one week. Additional improvements are achieved when the correlation structure of the intra-day relationships is explored. © 2013 IEEE.;"Disaggregated data; Electricity spot price; Factor model; Forecasting; Principal components; Vector autoregression";"Disaggregated data; Electricity spot price; Factor model; Principal Components; Vector autoregressions; Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Regression analysis; Forecasting";4;1, 2;1;1
Elattar E.E.;Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets based on local informative vector machine;2013;IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution;20;In a competitive electricity market, short-term electricity price forecasting are very important for market participants. Electricity price is a very complex signal as a result of its non-linearity, non-stationarity and time-variant behaviour. This study presents a new approach to short-term electricity price forecasting. The proposed method is derived by integrating the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method with the local informative vector machine (IVM), which can be derived by combining the IVM with the local regression method. IVM is a practical probabilistic alternative to the popular support vector machine. Local prediction makes use of similar historical data patterns in the reconstructed space to train the regression algorithm. In the proposed method, KPCA is used to extract features of the inputs and obtain kernel principal components for constructing the phase space of the time series of the inputs. Then local IVM is employed to solve the price forecasting problem. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world dataset.

Nowotarski J., Tomczyk J., Weron R.;Robust estimation and forecasting of the long-term seasonal component of electricity spot prices;2013;Energy Economics;46;We present the results of an extensive study on estimation and forecasting of the long-term seasonal component (LTSC) of electricity spot prices. We consider a battery of over 300 models, including monthly dummies and models based on Fourier or wavelet decomposition combined with linear or exponential decay. We find that the considered wavelet-based models are significantly better in terms of forecasting spot prices up to a year ahead than the commonly used monthly dummies and sine-based models. This result questions the validity and usefulness of stochastic models of spot electricity prices built on the latter two types of LTSC models. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;"Electricity spot price; Forecasting; Long-term seasonal component; Robust modeling; Wavelets";"Electricity spot price; Exponential decays; Long-term seasonal component; Robust estimation; Robust modeling; Spot electricity prices; Spot price; Wavelets; Electricity spot price; Exponential decays; Long-term seasonal component; Robust estimation; Robust modeling; Spot electricity prices; Wavelet based models; Wavelets; Electricity; Forecasting; Wavelet decomposition; Costs; Forecasting; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Costs; Stochastic models; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy market; forecasting method; modeling; price dynamics; electricity; energy market; forecasting method; modeling; wavelet analysis";4;1, 2, 3;1;1
Shayeghi H., Ghasemi A.;Day-ahead electricity prices forecasting by a modified CGSA technique and hybrid WT in LSSVM based scheme;2013;Energy Conversion and Management;66;At the present time, day-ahead electricity market is closely associated with other commodity markets such as fuel market and emission market. Under such an environment, day-ahead electricity price forecasting has become necessary for power producers and consumers in the current deregulated electricity markets. Seeking for more accurate price forecasting techniques, this paper proposes a new combination of a Feature Selection (FS) technique based mutual information (MI) technique and Wavelet Transform (WT) in this study. Moreover, in this paper a new modified version of Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) optimization based chaos theory, namely Chaotic Gravitational Search Algorithm (CGSA) is developed to find the optimal parameters of Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) to predict electricity prices. The performance and price forecast accuracy of the proposed technique is assessed by means of real data from Iran's, Ontario's and Spain's price markets. The simulation results from numerical tables and figures in different cases show that the proposed technique increases electricity price market forecasting accuracy than the other classical and heretical methods in the scientific researches. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Muñoz M.P., Corchero C., Heredia F.-J.;Improving electricity market price forecasting with factor models for the optimal generation bid;2013;International Statistical Review;4;In liberalized electricity markets, the electricity generation companies usually manage their production by developing hourly bids that are sent to the day-ahead market. As the prices at which the energy will be purchased are unknown until the end of the bidding process, forecasting of spot prices has become an essential element in electricity management strategies. In this article, we apply forecasting factor models to the market framework in Spain and Portugal and study their performance. Although their goodness of fit is similar to that of autoregressive integrated moving average models, they are easier to implement. The second part of the paper uses the spot-price forecasting model to generate inputs for a stochastic programming model, which is then used to determine the company's optimal generation bid. The resulting optimal bidding curves are presented and analyzed in the context of the Iberian day-ahead electricity market. © 2013 International Statistical Institute.;"Electricity market prices; Factor models; Price scenarios; Short-term forecasting; Stochastic programming";;4;1;1;1
Miranian A., Abdollahzade M., Hassani H.;Day-ahead electricity price analysis and forecasting by singular spectrum analysis;2013;IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution;28;This study proposes a model-free approach for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. The proposed approached is based on the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique. The SSA is a relatively new and powerful technique in time series analysis and forecasting thanks to its well-known capabilities in extracting the main structure of the broad classes of the time series. In this study, it is shown that SSA can be employed to decompose the original electricity price series into trend, periodic and noisy components. The main part of the price series, that is, the trend and harmonic components, is reconstructed by removing the noise component from the original series. The reconstructed price series is then used for forecasting the day-ahead electricity prices. The proposed approach is evaluated by analysing and forecasting of the dayahead electricity prices in the Australian and Spanish electricity markets. The forecasting results confirm the superiority of the SSA approach compared with some of the recently published forecasting techniques. ©The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.;;"Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price series; Electricity prices; Forecasting techniques; Harmonic components; Noise components; Singular spectrum analysis; Spanish electricity markets; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Forecasting; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Costs";4;1;1;1
Janczura J., Weron R.;Goodness-of-fit testing for the marginal distribution of regime-switching models with an application to electricity spot prices;2013;AStA Advances in Statistical Analysis;8;This paper complements a recently published study (Janczura and Weron in AStA-Adv Stat Anal 96(3):385-407, 2012) on efficient estimation of Markov regime-switching models. Here, we propose a new goodness-of-fit testing scheme for the marginal distribution of such models. We consider models with an observable (like threshold autoregressions) as well as a latent state process (like Markov regime-switching). The test is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov supremum-distance statistic and the concept of the weighted empirical distribution function. The motivation for this research comes from a recent stream of literature in energy economics concerning electricity spot price models. While the existence of distinct regimes in such data is generally unquestionable (due to the supply stack structure), the actual goodness-of-fit of the models requires statistical validation. We illustrate the proposed scheme by testing whether commonly used Markov regime-switching models fit deseasonalized electricity prices from the NEPOOL (US) day-ahead market. © 2012 The Author(s).;"Energy economics; Goodness-of-fit; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Regime-switching; Weighted empirical distribution function";;3;0;1;1
Pereira A.J.C., Saraiva J.T.;Long term impact of wind power generation in the Iberian day-ahead electricity market price;2013;Energy;25;The Iberian power systems went through important changes at the legal, regulatory and organizational levels in the last 20 years. One of the most relevant ones was the increasing penetration of distributed generation, namely wind parks, together with the development of the common market involving Portugal and Spain. In Portugal, distributed generation is paid using feed in tariffs while in Spain it can choose between receiving a regulated feed in tariff or the market price plus a participation prize. The feed in scheme is now under discussion since it is argued that it represents an excessive cost that is internalized in the end user tariffs. However, this discussion is frequently conducted without complete knowledge of the real impact of wind power on the electricity market price, since it contributes to reduce the demand on the market thus inducing a price reduction. To clarify these issues we used a long term System Dynamics based model already reported in a previous publication to estimate the long term evolution of the market price. This model was applied to the Iberian generation system using different shares of wind power capacity to quantify the impact of wind power on the day-ahead electricity market price. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;"Electricity markets; Electricity price; Iberian electricity market; Long term impact; System Dynamics model; Wind power";"Commerce; Distributed power generation; Electric industry; System theory; Wind power; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Iberian electricity market; Long-term impacts; System dynamics model; Costs; alternative energy; demand analysis; electricity industry; energy market; power generation; price dynamics; regulatory framework; renewable resource; wind farm; wind power; Iberian Peninsula";4;0;1;0
Cifter A.;Forecasting electricity price volatility with the Markov-switching GARCH model: Evidence from the Nordic electric power market;2013;Electric Power Systems Research;38;In this paper, electricity price behavior in the Nordic electric power market is forecasted with both the Markov-switching generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MS-GARCH) model and a set of different volatility models. The MS-GARCH model is estimated with two regimes, representing periods of low and high volatility. This study shows that electricity price volatility is not only highly volatile but also strongly regime-dependent. The empirical results show that the MS-GARCH model enables more accurate forecasting than the standard GARCH models, according to tail loss and reality check tests for one- and multi-step ahead forecasts. The results suggest that both the electricity generation companies and consumers of electricity could carry out better price forecasts by using the proposed MS-GARCH model. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Eichler M., Türk D.;Fitting semiparametric Markov regime-switching models to electricity spot prices;2013;Energy Economics;14;Recently regime-switching models have become the standard tool for modeling electricity prices. These models capture the main properties of electricity spot prices well but estimation of the model parameters requires computer intensive methods. Moreover, the distribution of the price spikes must be fully specified although the high volatility of the spikes makes it difficult to check such distributional assumptions. Consequently, there are a number of competing proposals for the distribution in the spike regime. As an alternative, we propose a semiparametric Markov regime-switching model that leaves the distribution under the spike regime unspecified. We show that the model parameters can be estimated by employing robust statistical techniques. This presents an alternative to the existing estimation methods that are based on computer intensive numerical maximization of the likelihood function. The model in combination with the estimation framework is easier to estimate, needs less computation time and distributional assumptions. To show its advantages we compare the proposed model with a well-established Markov regime-switching model in a simulation study. Furthermore, we apply the model to log-prices for the Australian electricity market. The results are in accordance with the results from the simulation study, indicating that the proposed model might be advantageous whenever the distribution of the spike process is not sufficiently known. The results are thus encouraging and suggest the use of our approach when modeling electricity prices and pricing derivatives. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.;"Electricity spot prices; Markov regime-switching; Mean-reversion; Robust estimation; Semiparametric estimation; Simulation study";"Electricity spot price; Markov regime-switching; Mean-reversion; Robust estimation; Semi parametric estimation; Simulation studies; Computer simulation; Costs; Electric properties; Electricity; Estimation; Numerical methods; Parameter estimation; computer simulation; electricity generation; energy market; estimation method; Markov chain; numerical model; price dynamics; Australia";3;1;1;1
Li X.R., Yu C.W., Ren S.Y., Chiu C.H., Meng K.;Day-ahead electricity price forecasting based on panel cointegration and particle filter;2013;Electric Power Systems Research;28;An accurate forecasting of energy price is important for generation companies (GENCOs) to develop their bidding strategies or to make investment decisions. Nowadays, day-ahead electricity market is closely associated with other commodity markets such as fuel market and emission market. Under such an environment, day-ahead electricity price is volatile and its volatility changes overtime due to the uncertainties from the multi-market. This paper proposes a two-stage hybrid model based on panel cointegration and particle filter (PCPF). Panel cointegration (PC) model, which utilizes information of both the inter-temporal dynamics and the individuality of interconnected regions, provides powerful forecasting tool for electricity price. Particle filter (PF) has achieved significant successes in tracking applications involving non-Gaussian signals and nonlinear systems. This paper has two main focuses: (1) To expand the dimension of electricity price dataset from time series to panel data so that the dynamics of interconnected regions can be analyzed simultaneously and considered as a whole. (2) Regarding the model coefficients as a time-varying process, PF is used to forecast electricity price adaptively. In the case study, the proposed PCPF model is applied to the real electricity market data of PJM in the year 2008. Promising results show clearly the superior predicting behavior of the proposed modeling. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Zhang J., Tan Z.;Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using WT, CLSSVM and EGARCH model;2013;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;42;Accurate price forecasting becomes more and more important for all market participants in competitive electricity markets, which can maximize producers' profits and consumers' utilities, respectively.

Anbazhagan S., Kumarappan N.;Day-ahead deregulated electricity market price forecasting using recurrent neural network;2013;IEEE Systems Journal;86;This paper proposes a recurrent neural network model for the day ahead deregulated electricity market price forecasting that could be realized using the Elman network. In a deregulated market, electricity price is influenced by many factors and exhibits a very complicated and irregular fluctuation. Both power producers and consumers need a single compact and robust price forecasting tool for maximizing their profits and utilities. In order to validate the chaotic characteristic of electricity price, an Elman network is modeled. The proposed Elman network is a single compact and robust architecture (without hybridizing the various hard and soft computing models). It has been observed that a nearly state of the art Elman network forecasting accuracy can be achieved with less computation time. The proposed Elman network approach is compared with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), mixed model, neural network, wavelet ARIMA, weighted nearest neighbors, fuzzy neural network, hybrid intelligent system, adaptive wavelet neural network, neural networks with wavelet transform, wavelet transform and a hybrid of neural networks and fuzzy logic, wavelet-ARIMA radial basis function neural networks, cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm, and wavelet transform, particle swarm optimization, and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system approaches to forecast the electricity market of mainland Spain. Finally, the accuracy of the price forecasting is also applied to the electricity market of New York in 2010, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2007-2012 IEEE.;"Deregulated electricity market; electricity price forecasting; Elman network; recurrent neural network";"Adaptive network based fuzzy inference system; Adaptive wavelet neural network; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithms; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Elman network; Radial basis function neural networks; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Intelligent systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Recurrent neural networks; Soft computing; Wavelet transforms; Forecasting";5;1, 2;1;1
Klæboe G., Eriksrud A.L., Fleten S.-E.;Benchmarking time series based forecasting models for electricity balancing market prices;2013;Energy Systems;28;In the trade-off between bidding in the day-ahead electricity market and the real time balancing market, producers need good forecasts for balancing market prices to make informed decisions. A range of earlier published models for forecasting of balancing market prices, including a few extensions, is benchmarked. The models are benchmarked both for 1 h-ahead and day-ahead forecast, and both point and interval forecasts are compared. None of the benchmarked models produce informative day-ahead point forecasts, suggesting that information available before the closing of the day-ahead market is efficiently reflected in the day-ahead market price rather than the balancing market price. Evaluation of the interval forecasts reveals that models without balancing state information overestimate variance, making them unsuitable for scenario generation. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;"Ancillary service market; Balancing market price; Electricity markets; Electricity price scenarios; Forecasting; Regulating market";"Costs; Economic and social effects; Power markets; Ancillary service markets; Balancing market; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Regulating market; Forecasting";4;1;3;1, 2

Residual demand is defined as the total electricity demand subtracted by hard to predict renewable energy sources. Focus of this paper lies on wind power generation as the main renewable energy source. First, the long-term influence of wind power on the electricity market price is investigated. Second, the short-term dependency between electricity market price and wind power generation is examined by applying the similar day method to the Spanish day-ahead market as well as data association mining. Third, a novel method of how to use wind power information is introduced. © 2013 IEEE.;"Price forecasting; residual demand; Wind power";"Costs; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Electric power generation; Information use; Learning systems; Natural resources; Wind power; Data association; Day-ahead electricity market; Electricity demands; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Price forecasting; Renewable energy source; Residual demand; Weather forecasting";5;1;1;1
Liu D., Wei Y., Yang S., Guan Z.;Electricity price forecast using combined models with adaptive weights selected and errors calibrated by hidden Markov model;2013;Mathematical Problems in Engineering;4;A combined forecast with weights adaptively selected and errors calibrated by Hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed to model the day-ahead electricity price. Firstly several single models were built to forecast the electricity price separately. Then the validation errors from every individual model were transformed into two discrete sequences: an emission sequence and a state sequence to build the HMM, obtaining a transmission matrix and an emission matrix, representing the forecasting ability state of the individual models. The combining weights of the individual models were decided by the state transmission matrixes in HMM and the best predict sample ratio of each individual among all the models in the validation set. The individual forecasts were averaged to get the combining forecast with the weights obtained above. The residuals of combining forecast were calibrated by the possible error calculated by the emission matrix of HMM. A case study of day-ahead electricity market of Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), USA, suggests that the proposed method outperforms individual techniques of price forecasting, such as support vector machine (SVM), generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), day-ahead modeling, and self-organized map (SOM) similar days modeling. © 2013 Da Liu et al.;;"Costs; Electric load forecasting; Errors; Hidden Markov models; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Combined forecasts; Combining forecasts; Day-ahead electricity market; Forecasting ability; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Individual modeling; Self-organized map; Transmission matrix; Forecasting";3, 4, 5;1, 2;1;1
Voronin S., Partanen J.;Price forecasting in the day-ahead energy market by an iterative method with separate normal price and price spike frameworks;2013;Energies;32;A forecasting methodology for prediction of both normal prices and price spikes in the day-ahead energy market is proposed. The method is based on an iterative strategy implemented as a combination of two modules separately applied for normal price and price spike predictions. The normal price module is a mixture of wavelet transform, linear AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and nonlinear neural network models. The probability of a price spike occurrence is produced by a compound classifier in which three single classification techniques are used jointly to make a decision. Combined with the spike value prediction technique, the output from the price spike module aims to provide a comprehensive price spike forecast. The overall electricity price forecast is formed as combined normal price and price spike forecasts. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated with real data from the Finnish Nord Pool Spot day-ahead energy market. The proposed method provides significant improvement in both normal price and price spike prediction accuracy compared with some of the most popular forecast techniques applied for case studies of energy markets. © 2013 by the authors.;"Compound classifier; Electricity price forecasts; Hybrid methodology; Input feature selection; Price spike forecasts";"Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Mathematical transformations; Power quality; Wavelet transforms; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Classification technique; Compound classifiers; Day-ahead energy markets; Electricity prices; Hybrid methodologies; Nonlinear neural networks; Price spike; Power markets";4, 5;1;1;1

A comprehensive comparative analysis with other soft computing and hybrid models shows a significant improvement in forecast error bymore than 40% for daily andweekly price forecasts, through the application of a proposed hybrid WT + FF + FA model. Furthermore, low values obtained for the forecast mean square error (FMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) indicate high degree of accuracy of the proposed model. Robustness of the proposed hybrid intelligent model is measured by using the statistical index (error variance).

Bandyopadhayay A., Roy S., Ghosh D.;Forecasting day-ahead price of electricity - A dynamic regression approach;2013;International Journal of Business Excellence;6;The electricity market is being deregulated all over the world. Deregulation has brought in a variety of trading systems such as day-ahead trading and has also introduced high volatility of electricity prices. The large variability of price increases the risk for the market participants and forces the business houses to look for a forecasting accuracy of about ± 3%. This paper provides a method to predict next-day electricity prices using dynamic regression methodology where the price was regressed on selected demand, as well as supply side variables available in the public domain, and the error has been modelled using ARIMA / SARIMA models. The results were found to be very encouraging with MAPE lying in the range of ± 3.5% in most cases. In order to reduce the complexity associated with developing many models, a clustering methodology was used to group the different hours of the day so as to reduce the number of forecasting models to be fitted. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with single linkage was used and models for representative hours had the required level of accuracy.

Bordignon S., Bunn D.W., Lisi F., Nan F.;Combining day-ahead forecasts for British electricity prices;2013;Energy Economics;79;This paper considers how well the approach of combining forecasts extends to the context of electricity prices. With the increasing popularity of regime switching and time-varying parameter models for predicting power prices, the multi model and evolutionary considerations that usually support the combining of simpler time series methods may be less applicable when the individual models incorporate these features. We address this question with a backtesting analysis on British day-ahead prices. Furthermore, given the volatility of power prices and concerns about accurate forecasting under extreme price excursions, we evaluate the results using various error metrics including expected shortfall. The comparisons are furthermore carefully simulated to consider model selection uncertainty in order to realistically test the value of combining as an ex ante policy. Overall, our results support combining for both accurate operational planning and risk management. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.;"ARMAX; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasts combination; Markov regime switching; Prediction accuracy; Time-varying parameter regression";"ARMAX; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasts combination; Prediction accuracy; Regime switching; Time varying parameter; Electric load forecasting; Forecasting; Risk management; Time varying control systems; Costs; accuracy assessment; comparative study; electricity supply; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; forecasting method; Markov chain; model test; model validation; parameterization; risk assessment; time series analysis; United Kingdom";3, 4;1;1;2

The nonlinear and nonstationary influence of these explanatory variables is accommodated in a first step based on a nonparametric and time-varying regression model. In a second step, time-series models, i.e., ARMA and Holt-Winters, are applied to account for residual autocorrelation and seasonal dynamics.

Asrari A., Javidi M.H.;Application of a new hybrid method for day-ahead energy price forecasting in Iranian electricity market;2012;Iranian Journal of Electrical and Electronic Engineering;2;In a typical competitive electricity market, a large number of short-term and long-term contracts are set on the basis of energy price by an Independent System Operator (ISO). Under such circumstances, accurate electricity price forecasting can lead to the more reasonable bidding strategies adopted by the electricity market participants.

Keynia F.;A new feature selection algorithm and composite neural network for electricity price forecasting;2012;Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence;42;In a competitive electricity market, the forecasting of energy prices is an important activity for all the market participants either for developing bidding strategies or for making investment decisions. In this paper, a new forecast strategy is proposed for day ahead prediction of electricity price, which is a complex signal with nonlinear, volatile and time dependent behavior. Our forecast strategy includes a new two stage feature selection algorithm, a composite neural network (CNN) and a few auxiliary predictors. The feature selection algorithm has two filtering stages to remove irrelevant and redundant candidate inputs, respectively. This algorithm is based on mutual information (MI) criterion and selects the input variables of the CNN among a large set of candidate inputs. The CNN is composed of a few neural networks (NN) with a new data flow among its building blocks. The CNN is the forecast engine of the proposed strategy. A kind of cross-validation technique is also presented to fine-tune the adjustable parameters of the feature selection algorithm and CNN.

Lei M., Feng Z.;A proposed grey model for short-term electricity price forecasting in competitive power markets;2012;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;37;In order to improve the performance of traditional grey models for short-term electricity price prediction in competitive power markets, a novel grey model, named PGM(1,2,a,b), is proposed in this paper. In the proposed model, the reference sequence is determined with correlation method. Furthermore, considering the limitation of the least square method (LSM), particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is adopted to identify the parameters instead of LSM. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, public available data coming from Nordpool, California, and Ontario power markets were used for training and testing. Simulation results show that the proposed model is capable of forecasting short-term electricity price efficiently and accurately. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Gianfreda A., Grossi L.;Forecasting Italian electricity zonal prices with exogenous variables;2012;Energy Economics;68;In the last few years we have observed the deregulation in electricity markets and an increasing interest in price dynamics has been developed especially to consider all stylized facts shown by spot prices. Only few papers have considered the Italian Electricity Spot market since it has been deregulated recently. Therefore, this contribution is an investigation with emphasis on price dynamics accounting for technologies, market concentration, congestions and volumes. We aim to understand how these four variables affect zonal prices since these ones combine to bring about the single national price (prezzo unico d'acquisto, PUN). Hence, understanding its features is important for drawing policy indications referred to production planning and selection of generation sources, pricing and risk-hedging problems, monitoring of market power positions and finally to motivate investment strategies in new power plants and grid interconnections. Implementing Reg-ARFIMA-GARCH models, we assess the forecasting performance of selected models showing that they perform better when these factors are considered. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.;"Congestions; Electricity prices; Forecasting; Fractional integration; Market power; Production technologies";"Congestions; Electricity prices; Fractional integration; Market Power; Production technology; Commerce; Costs; Economics; Electricity; Forecasting; Planning; Power plants; Production control; Deregulation; electricity supply; energy market; energy policy; forecasting method; investment; price dynamics; pricing policy";4;1;1, 3;2
Zhang J., Tan Z., Yang S.;Day-ahead electricity price forecasting by a new hybrid method;2012;Computers and Industrial Engineering;38;Electricity price forecasting has become necessary for power producers and consumers in the current deregulated electricity markets. Seeking for more accurate price forecasting techniques, this paper proposes a new hybrid method based on wavelet transform (WT), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) to predict electricity prices.

Haugom E., Ullrich C.J.;Forecasting spot price volatility using the short-term forward curve;2012;Energy Economics;13;We use high frequency real time spot prices and day-ahead forward prices from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland wholesale electricity market to calculate, describe, and forecast spot price volatility. We introduce the concept of forward realized volatility calculated from day-ahead forward prices. Forward realized volatility improves forecasts of spot price volatility - in the sense of higher R 2s and significantly lower forecast errors - when compared with forecasts based solely upon historical volatility. The largest forecast improvements obtained when the change in forward realized volatility is large in magnitude. Splitting total volatility into its continuous and jump components is crucial for forecasting volatility at weekly and monthly horizons. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.;"Electricity markets; Forward prices; Implied volatility; Realized volatility; Volatility forecasting";"Electricity market; Forward price; Implied volatility; Realized volatility; Volatility forecasting; Costs; Forecasting; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; price dynamics; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; United States";4;1, 2;1, 2;1
Lagarto J., De Sousa J., Martins Á., Ferrão P.;Price forecasting in the day-ahead Iberian electricity market using a conjectural variations ARIMA model;2012;9th International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM 12;14;Price forecast is a matter of concern for all participants in electricity markets, from suppliers to consumers through policy makers, which are interested in the accurate forecast of day-ahead electricity prices either for better decisions making or for an improved evaluation of the effectiveness of market rules and structure. This paper describes a methodology to forecast market prices in an electricity market using an ARIMA model applied to the conjectural variations of the firms acting in an electricity market. This methodology is applied to the Iberian electricity market to forecast market prices in the 24 hours of a working day. The methodology was then compared with two other methodologies, one called naïve and the other a direct forecast of market prices using also an ARIMA model. Results show that the conjectural variations price forecast performs better than the naïve and that it performs slightly better than the direct price forecast. © 2012 IEEE.;"ARIMA model; conjectural variations; electricity market simulation; Iberian electricity market; price forecasting; strategic behavior";"ARIMA models; Conjectural variations; Electricity market simulation; Iberian electricity market; Price forecasting; Strategic Behavior; Commerce; Computer simulation; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting";4;1;1;1
Fuglerud M., Vedahl K.E., Fleten S.-E.;Equilibrium simulation of the Nordic electricity spot price;2012;9th International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM 12;5;We develop a bottom-up, midterm model for the Nord Pool system price. Models for consumption, generation and exchange are combined using a market equilibrium approach. Scenarios for the most influential stochastic factors are created using statistical models. Forecasted price scenarios yield an indication on the expected future system price, and the uncertainty in future prices. Compared to stochastic dynamic programming based models, we use an empirical function to approximate the water value, with a possible benefit in terms of computational effort. In addition to providing a picture of the price distribution, the model can be applied to learn about the impact of fundamental variables. In particular, we study the relative influence of each of the stochastic factors. The performance of the model is evaluated in numerical examples over a two-year forecast period. Overall, we conclude the model provides realistic forecasts of the system price and its distribution. The performance under normal market conditions may deviate from our results, due to the extraordinary drop in fuel prices caused by the financial crisis. © 2012 IEEE.;"bootstrapping; electricity prices; fuel uncertainty; heating degree days; partial equilibrium; Power system economics; snow reservoirs; Sobol sequence; unit outage uncertainty; wind uncertainty";"bootstrapping; Electricity prices; Heating degree-days; Partial equilibrium; Power system economics; Sobol sequence; unit outage uncertainty; Wind uncertainties; Commerce; Normal distribution; Outages; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Costs";4;2;1;0
Kristiansen T.;Forecasting Nord Pool day-ahead prices with an autoregressive model;2012;Energy Policy;52;This paper presents a model to forecast Nord Pool hourly day-ahead prices. The model is based on Weron and Misiorek (2008) but reduced in terms of estimation parameters (from 24 sets to 1) and modified to include Nordic demand and Danish wind power as exogenous variables. We model prices across all hours in the analysis period rather than across each single hour of 24. hours. By applying three model variants on Nord Pool data, we achieve a weekly mean absolute percentage error (WMAE) of around 6-7% and an hourly mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranging from 8% to 11%. Out of sample results yields a WMAE and an hourly MAPE of around 5%. The models enable analysts and traders to forecast hourly day-ahead prices accurately. Moreover, the models are relatively straightforward and user-friendly to implement. They can be set up in any trading organization. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.;"Autoregressive exogenous model; Nordic power market; Price forecasting";"Auto regressive models; Autoregressive exogenous models; Day-ahead prices; Estimation parameters; Exogenous variables; Mean absolute percentage error; Model price; Power markets; Price forecasting; Three models; Commerce; Forecasting; Lakes; Wind power; Costs; accuracy assessment; demand analysis; economic analysis; energy market; error analysis; estimation method; forecasting method; model test; parameterization; wind power; Denmark";4;1;1;1

Joëts M., Mignon V.;On the link between forward energy prices: A nonlinear panel cointegration approach;2012;Energy Economics;19;This paper investigates the relationship between forward prices of oil, gas, coal, and electricity using a nonlinear panel cointegration framework. To this end, we consider a panel of 35 maturities and control for the economic and financial environment using equity futures prices. Estimating the cointegrating relationship, we find that oil, gas and coal forward prices are positively linked, while the negative link between oil and electricity prices is consistent with a substitution effect between the two energy sources on the long run. Estimating panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) models, we show that the forward oil price adjustment process toward its equilibrium value is nonlinear and asymmetric, putting forward the key role played by self-sustaining dynamics and speculation phenomena. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.;"Forward energy prices; Nonlinear model; Panel cointegration; PSTR; Speculation";"Forward energy; Non-linear model; Panel cointegration; PSTR; Speculation; Economics; Energy resources; Costs; cointegration analysis; commodity price; energy market; numerical model; price dynamics; regression analysis";4;0;1;0

González V., Contreras J., Bunn D.W.;Forecasting power prices using a hybrid fundamental-econometric model;2012;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;47;We investigate the performance of two hybrid forecasting models to predict the next-day base load electricity prices on the APX power exchange for Great Britain. Hybrid models have often been advocated as a synthetic method for forecasting, but it is an open question how well they perform at the day-ahead stage. A conventional hybrid approach combines a fundamental model, formulated with supply stack modeling, with an econometric model using data on price drivers. We extend this model to one based upon logistic smooth transition regression, which represents a regime-switching for periods of structural change. Empirical results for out-of-sample forecasting using both hybrid approaches are discussed and compared to non-hybrid time series forecasting methods. © 2006 IEEE.;"APX power exchange; electricity markets; fundamental model; hybrid model; logistic smooth transition regression; margin; price forecasting; volatility";"Electricity market; fundamental model; hybrid model; margin; Power exchange; Price forecasting; volatility; Costs; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Power quality; Time series; Electric load forecasting";2, 3, 4;1;1;1

Mori H., Itagaki T.;An electricity price zone forecasting method with fuzzy inference net;2012;IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC-PapersOnline);3;This paper proposes a Fuzzy Inference Net (FIN) method for electricity price zone forecasting. Under smart grid environment, it is important for players to maximize profits and minimize risks though power markets while introducing renewable energy into grids. The time series of electricity price becomes more complicated due to the nonlinearity and uncertainties. To capture the behavior of the time series appropriately, more sophisticated methods are required to overcome them as a prediction tool. In this paper, a new method is proposed for price zone forecasting. The proposed method makes use of FIN that evaluates the association probability of unknown data to predetermined clusters with fuzzy inference and self-organization. The selection of input variables is determined by the variable importance of the CART algorithm of data mining. The association probability is used determine which zone the one-step ahead electricity price belong to.

Hong Y.-Y., Wu C.-P.;Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using a hybrid principal component analysis network;2012;Energies;35;Bidding competition is one of the main transaction approaches in a deregulated electricity market. Locational marginal prices (LMPs) resulting from bidding competition and system operation conditions indicate electricity values at a node or in an area. The LMP reveals important information for market participants in developing their bidding strategies. Moreover,LMP is also a vital indicator for the Security Coordinator to perform market redispatch for congestion management. This paper presents a method using a principal component analysis (PCA) network cascaded with a multi-layer feedforward (MLF) network for forecasting LMPs in a day-ahead market. The PCA network extracts essential features from periodic information in the market. These features serve as inputs to the MLF network for forecasting LMPs. The historical LMPs in the PJM market are employed to test the proposed method. It is found that the proposed method is capable of forecasting day-ahead LMP values efficiently. © 2012 by the authors.;"Forecasting; Locational marginal price; Principal component analysis";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Power markets; Bidding strategy; Congestion management; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Essential features; Hybrid principal component analysis; Locational marginal prices; Market participants; Principal component analysis";5;1;1;1
Azadeh A., Tabrizi B.H., Ebrahimipour V.;A comparative study for optimum short-term forecasting of electricity price with uncertainty;2012;International Journal of Industrial and Systems Engineering;2;This paper presents an integrated algorithm consisting of artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy linear regression (FLR) and conventional linear regression (CLR) for optimum short-term electricity price forecasting. Eight ANN models and seven well-known FLR models as well as CLR model are considered simultaneously to provide a robust framework for electricity price forecasting. Thus, it can be easily applied to uncertain and complex environments due to its flexibility. The input data are divided into train and test parts to test the results for further times. Data sets are compared with ANN, fuzzy regression (FR) and conventional regression (CR) techniques in a comprehensive empirical process, with respect to mean absolute percent error measure. It is shown that ANN leads to the most efficient outputs, although, sometimes FR models could yield suitable results. Then, the procedure is repeated for normalised data, and recent results are obtained again, which puts a validation on what was concluded before. At last, the research has been practiced in Iran and proved to be efficient, as the circumstances dominating the society do not follow a steady trend. This is the first study that investigates intelligent models for short-term electricity price forecasting with uncertainty.

Menniti D., Scordino N., Sorrentino N.;A novel approach to forecast day-ahead electricity prices by means of neural networks using groups of similar hours;2012;International Review of Electrical Engineering;1;Forecasting short-term electricity market prices has been the focus of several studies in recent years. Although various approaches have been examined, achieving sufficiently low forecasting errors has not always been possible. However, certain applications, such as demandside management, do not require exact values for future prices, but utilize average values as the basis for making short-term scheduling decisions. With the aim of enhancing the accuracy of the day-ahead electricity price forecasting, field records of the Italian electricity market have been correlated so as to identify a number of blocks of hours, characterized by similarity of price. This paper thus proposes an approach to forecast the day-ahead electricity prices by means of a number of Neural Networks (NNs), with such a number being equal to the number of groups of hours with similarity of price, and with each NN forecasting the mean price over the hours belonging to the related group, as previously determined. Simulation results show that the fundamental and novel contribution of identifying, firstly, the membership of an hour to a particular group of hours, clustered according to their similarity of price, and then forecasting day-ahead prices for the resulting number of groups of hours performs fairly well if compared with other forecasting techniques, either on an hourly or on an average basis, in terms of mean absolute and absolute percentage errors, as well as of variance. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.;"Back propagation; Electricity market prices; Forecasting; Neural network; Time series";;5;1;1;0
Chaǎbane N., Saǎdaoui F., Benammou S.;Modelling power spot prices in deregulated European energy markets: A dual long memory approach;2012;Global Business and Economics Review;5;In the last decade, with deregulation and introduction of competition in power markets, prices forecasting have become a real challenge for all market participants. However, forecasting is a rather complex task since electricity prices involve many features comparably with financial ones. Electricity markets have a highly volatile nature. They are indeed a more unpredictable than that of other commodities referred to as extreme volatile. In this paper, the two most emerging European electricity markets are considered. A preliminary analysis of the time series attests to the presence of a long range dependance behaviour. Therefore, prices processes are modelled using ARFIMA-FIGARCH under Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions. Such models are sufficiently flexible to handle the long memory phenomena often encountered in both conditional mean and conditional variance in electricity spot prices. Forecasting is subsequently performed on the basis of adequate models.

García-Martos C., Rodríguez J., Sánchez M.J.;Forecasting electricity prices by extracting dynamic common factors: application to the Iberian Market;2012;IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution;27;Developing methodology for computing accurate forecasts of electricity prices in liberalised markets is necessary to improve the bids submitted to the market operator by both consumers and producers to maximise their benefits and utilities, respectively. Here, we propose the extraction of common factors from the 24-dimensional vector of prices, and using them for one-day-ahead forecasting. This methodology is based on the Peña-Box (1987) and Lee-Carter (1992) models and is able to take into account the multivariate structure of the data. The data selected to illustrate the proposed methodology are those from the Iberian Market in the period January 2007 to January 2009, and numerical results in terms of prediction accuracy have also been compared with those by García-Martos et al. (2007), obtaining a statistically significant improvement. For the whole period used to test the out-of-sample forecasting accuracy the authors have computed a forecast for every hour and the average MAPE is 7.39%. Furthermore, a very important feature of the proposed methodology, the Dynamic Factor Model (DFM) is that is a powerful tool for mid- and long-term forecasting. This is an important difference between DFM and other methodologies for which the accuracy dramatically degrades when increasing the forecasting horizon. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.;;"Common factors; Dynamic factor models; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Iberian market; Long-term forecasting; Market operators; Numerical results; Prediction accuracy; Commerce; Forecasting";4;2, 3;1;1

Accurate forecasting of the future electricity prices has become the most important management goal since it forms the basis of maximizing profits for the market participants. Electricity price forecasting however is a complex task due to non-linearity, non-stationarity and volatility of the price signal.

An optimum selection amongst a large number of various input combinations and parameters is a real challenge for any modelers in using SVMs. This study applies SVM to predicting the hourly market prices of Ontario market.

Anbazhagan S., Kumarappan N., Gnanaprakasam;A temporal input based day-ahead price forecasting in asia's first liberalized electricity market using GRNN;2011;IET Conference Publications;1;This paper proposes a day-ahead electricity price forecasting that could be realized using generalized regression neural network (GRNN) with temporal input. In this work application of GRNN model were applied to national electricity market of Singapore (NEMS), i.e. Asia's first liberalized electricity market. The individual price of year 2006 is very volatile with a very wide range. Therefore, accurate forecasting models are required for Singapore electricity market company (EMC) to maximize their profits and for consumers to maximize their utilities. Hence the year 2006 has been taken for forecasting the uniform Singapore electricity price (USEP). The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) results show that the proposed GRNN model possess better forecasting abilities than the other ANN models without temporal input and its performance was least affected by the volatility.;"Generalized regression neural network (GRNN); National electricity market of Singapore (NEMS); Price forecasting; Uniform Singapore energy price (USEP)";"Day-ahead prices; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting ability; Forecasting models; Generalized regression neural networks; Liberalized electricity market; Mean absolute percentage error; National electricity market of Singapore (NEMS); National electricity markets; Price forecasting; Singapore; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Energy conservation; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Profitability; Electricity";4, 5;1;1;1

Serinaldi F.;Distributional modeling and short-term forecasting of electricity prices by Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape;2011;Energy Economics;47;In the context of the liberalized and deregulated electricity markets, price forecasting has become increasingly important for energy company's plans and market strategies. Within the class of the time series models that are used to perform price forecasting, the subclasses of methods based on stochastic time series and causal models commonly provide point forecasts, whereas the corresponding uncertainty is quantified by approximate or simulation-based confidence intervals. Aiming to improve the uncertainty assessment, this study introduces the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) to model the dynamically varying distribution of prices. The GAMLSS allow fitting a variety of distributions whose parameters change according to covariates via a number of linear and nonlinear relationships. In this way, price periodicities, trends and abrupt changes characterizing both the position parameter (linked to the expected value of prices), and the scale and shape parameters (related to price volatility, skewness, and kurtosis) can be explicitly incorporated in the model setup. Relying on the past behavior of the prices and exogenous variables, the GAMLSS enable the short-term (one-day ahead) forecast of the entire distribution of prices. The approach was tested on two datasets from the widely studied California Power Exchange (CalPX) market, and the less mature Italian Power Exchange (IPEX). CalPX data allow comparing the GAMLSS forecasting performance with published results obtained by different models. The study points out that the GAMLSS framework can be a flexible alternative to several linear and nonlinear stochastic models. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.;"Electricity market price; GAMLSS models; Interval forecasting; Liberalized energy markets; Point forecasting";"Electricity market; Energy markets; GAMLSS models; Interval forecasting; Point forecasting; Commerce; Computer simulation; Costs; Deregulation; Electricity; Forecasting; Statistical methods; Stochastic systems; Time series; Stochastic models; assessment method; commodity price; electricity generation; energy market; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; stochasticity; time series analysis; uncertainty analysis";4;1;1;2
Cruz A., Muñoz A., Zamora J.L., Espínola R.;The effect of wind generation and weekday on Spanish electricity spot price forecasting;2011;Electric Power Systems Research;68;This paper empirically compares the predictive accuracy of a set of methods for day-ahead spot price forecasting in the Spanish electricity market. The methods come from time series analysis and artificial intelligence disciplines, and include univariate, multivariate, linear and nonlinear. Within the univariate methods, the double seasonal ARIMA and the recently proposed exponential smoothing for double seasonality are compared and used as benchmarks. They allow us to quantify the improvement on price forecasting when including explanatory variables or using more complex models. Dynamic regression models including the electricity load forecast are then considered. Their good performance in price forecasting has been pointed out by many authors. However, we find evidences of their predictive accuracy can be significantly outperformed by accounting the wind generation forecast provided by the System Operator. Moreover, these forecasts can be even more accurate if changes of price's behavior according with the day of the week are taken into account by means of periodic models. The last of the tested methods are feed-forward neural networks used as multivariate nonlinear regression methods with universal function approximation capabilities. The influence of the wind generation forecast on price prediction is also proved with this approach. Detailed out-of-sample results of the tested methods are given. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Accurate price forecasting provides crucial information for electricity market participants to make reasonable competing strategies, which is related to the position and benefit of the market participators. So using the relative historic data in predicting the future electricity price is a very meaningful work.

Menniti D., Scordino N., Sorrentino N.;Forecasting next-day electricity prices by a neural network approach;2011;2011 8th International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM 11;3;Forecasting short-term electricity market prices has been the focus of several studies in recent years. Although various approaches have been examined, achieving sufficiently low forecasting errors has not been always possible. However, certain applications, such as demand-side management, do not require exact values for future prices but utilize averages values as the basis for making short-term scheduling decisions. With the aim of enhancing the accuracy of the next-day electricity price forecasting, this paper proposes an approach to forecast the day-ahead electricity prices by means of n Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), based on the estimation of the mean prices of n blocks of hours, with n identified according to the values of correlation factors computed on the basis of field records of the Italian electricity market. Simulation results show that forecasting next-day prices on an hourly basis induces to an error which results worse than the one made when average prices are forecasted according to groups of hours. © 2011 IEEE.;;"Correlation factors; Demand side managements; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Field record; Forecasting error; Short-term scheduling; Simulation result; Commerce; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Electric utilities; Electricity; Forecasting; Neural networks; Scheduling; Costs";5;1;1;1
Amjady N., Keynia F.;A new prediction strategy for price spike forecasting of day-ahead electricity markets;2011;Applied Soft Computing Journal;36;Price spikes are distinctive aspects of electricity price impacting its forecast accuracy. Electricity price spikes can also have serious economical effects on the market participants. However, prediction of electricity price spikes is a complex task and most of current electricity price forecast methods focus on prediction of normal prices. In this paper, a new forecast strategy for prediction of both occurrence and value of electricity price spikes is presented. The proposed strategy has a novel feature selection technique based on information theoretic criteria to select a minimum subset of the most informative features for the forecast process. Also, the strategy includes a new closed loop prediction mechanism composed of probabilistic neural network (PNN) and hybrid neuro-evolutionary system (HNES) forecast engines. The effectiveness of the proposed forecast strategy for the prediction of both price spike occurrence and value is extensively evaluated by the real-life data of PJM (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland) electricity market.

Chakravarty S., Dash P.K.;Dynamic filter weights neural network model integrated with differential evolution for day-ahead price forecasting in energy market;2011;Expert Systems with Applications;13;In this paper a new dynamic model for forecasting electricity prices from 1 to 24 h in advance is proposed. The model is a dynamic filter weight Adaline using a sliding mode weight adaptation technique. The filter weights for this neuron constitute of first order dynamic filter with adjustable parameters. Sliding mode invariance conditions determine a least square characterization of the adaptive weights average dynamics whose stability features may be studied using standard time varying linear system results. The approach is found to exhibit robustness characteristics and first convergence properties. Comparison of results with a local linear wavelet neural network model is also presented in this paper. The hourly electricity prices of California and Spanish energy markets are taken as experimental data and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are computed to find out the forecasting performance of both the models. In both the cases the MAPE and RMSE are found to be within the tolerable limits.

Dong Y., Wang J., Jiang H., Wu J.;Short-term electricity price forecast based on the improved hybrid model;2011;Energy Conversion and Management;60;Half-hourly electricity price in power system are volatile, electricity price forecast is significant information which can help market managers and participants involved in electricity market to prepare their corresponding bidding strategies to maximize their benefits and utilities. However, the fluctuation of electricity price depends on the common effect of many factors and there is a very complicated random in its evolution process. Therefore, it is difficult to forecast half-hourly prices with traditional only one model for different behaviors of half-hourly prices.

Shafie-Khah M., Moghaddam M.P., Sheikh-El-Eslami M.K.;Price forecasting of day-ahead electricity markets using a hybrid forecast method;2011;Energy Conversion and Management;146;Energy price forecasting in a competitive electricity market is crucial for the market participants in planning their operations and managing their risk, and it is also the key information in the economic optimization of the electric power industry. However, price series usually have a complex behavior due to their nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variancy. In this paper, a novel hybrid method to forecast day-ahead electricity price is proposed. This hybrid method is based on wavelet transform, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFN). The wavelet transform provides a set of better-behaved constitutive series than price series for prediction. ARIMA model is used to generate a linear forecast, and then RBFN is developed as a tool for nonlinear pattern recognition to correct the estimation error in wavelet-ARIMA forecast. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the network structure which makes the RBFN be adapted to the specified training set, reducing computation complexity and avoiding overfitting. The proposed method is examined on the electricity market of mainland Spain and the results are compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods. The results show that the proposed hybrid method could provide a considerable improvement for the forecasting accuracy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Singhal D., Swarup K.S.;Electricity price forecasting using artificial neural networks;2011;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;126;"Electricity price forecasting in deregulated open power markets using neural networks is presented. Forecasting electricity price is a challenging task for on-line trading and e-commerce. Bidding competition is one of the main transaction approaches after deregulation. Forecasting the hourly market-clearing prices (MCP) in daily power markets is the most essential task and basis for any decision making in order to maximize the benefits. Artificial neural networks are found to be most suitable tool as they can map the complex interdependencies between electricity price, historical load and other factors. The neural network approach is used to predict the market behaviors based on the historical prices, quantities and other information to forecast the future prices and quantities. The basic idea is to use history and other estimated factors in the future to ""fit"" and ""extrapolate"" the prices and quantities. A neural network method to forecast the market-clearing prices (MCPs) for day-ahead energy markets is developed. The structure of the neural network is a three-layer back propagation (BP) network.

Hourly and daily data used for estimation are normalized in order to minimize the seasonal-ity bias in our predictions. Given the high dimensionality of the problem, we use the LAD-Lasso model selection as a way to prevent data overfitting. To test the proposed framework we used the German electricity spot price time-series. We discuss the effects of large negative hourly prices, residuals of daily estimation and data outliers. We show that our framework provides significantly improved estimation of the HPFC compared to the simple mean estimators.;"Electricity price modeling; Hourly price forward curve; Non-normal distributions; Robust statistics; Spot markets";"Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Normal distribution; Power markets; Electricity price model; Hourly prices; Non-normal distribution; Robust statistics; Spot market; Cost estimating";4;0;1;0

Azadeh A., Ghaderi S.F., Nokhandan B.P., Nassiri S.;Improved one day-ahead price forecasting using combined time series and artificial neural network models for the electricity market;2011;International Journal of Industrial and Systems Engineering;12;The price forecasts embody crucial information for generators when planning bidding strategies to maximise profits. Therefore, generation companies need accurate price forecasting tools. Comparison of neural network and auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to forecast commodity prices in pervious researches showed that the artificial neural network (ANN) forecasts were considerably more accurate than traditional ARIMA models. This paper provides an accurate and efficient tool for shortterm price forecasting based on the combination of ANN and ARIMA. Firstly, input variables for ANN are determined by time series analysis. This model relates the current prices to the values of past prices. Secondly, ANN is used for one day-ahead price forecasting. A three-layered feed-forward neural network algorithm is used for forecasting next-day electricity prices. The ANN model is then trained and tested using data from electricity market of Iran. According to pervious studies, in the case of neural networks and ARIMA models, historical demand data do not significantly improve predictions. The results show that the combined ANN-ARIMA forecasts prices with high accuracy for short-term periods. Also, it is shown that policy-making strategies would be enhanced due to increased precision and reliability.

In this work applications of various models were applied to national electricity market of Singapore (NEMS), i.e. Asia's first liberalized electricity market. The individual price of year 2006 is very volatile with a very wide range. Therefore, accurate forecasting models are required for Singapore electricity market company (EMC) to maximize their profits and for consumers to maximize their utilities. Hence the year 2006 has been taken for forecasting the uniform Singapore electricity price (USEP).

Sun Y., Bansal R.C., Bhardwaj A.K., Srivastava A.K.;Electricity market price forecasting using support vector machines;2011;International Journal of Computer Aided Engineering and Technology;3;Due to the electricity market deregulation, the techniques used for load forecasting have gradually improved over the years. Deregulation in the power system industry has caused rising requirement in planning, operating and controlling electric energy systems, which brings electricity load forecasting to a crucial level. Therefore, adequate techniques are desired for accurately predicting the load and hence assisting power companies in generating capacity scheduling, maintenance, energy planning and procurement, etc. An accurate forecast can greatly help power distribution companies to improve their electricity marketing strategies and avoid over or under unitisation of generating capacity and therefore optimises energy prices. But, to predict the load demand in real time requires a considerable amount of efforts. This paper presents a design methodology for a short term load forecasting useful for distribution companies, which are capable of interacting with users, gathering historical load data, performing a statistical analysis on the historical data and plotting graphs of the predicted load using the support vector machine (SVM). SVM is the chosen forecasting technique because many studies have concluded that SVMs produce the optimum accuracy as compared to other methods such as Naive Bayesian, but SVM has not been optimised for the domain. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.;"deregulation; load forecasting; short term load forecasting; STLF; support vector machine; SVM";;5;1;0;1
Li X.I., Yu C.W., Ren S., Meng K., Liu G.;Day-ahead electricity market price forecasting based on panel cointegration;2010;IEEE PES General Meeting, PES 2010;3;This paper proposes a novel technique to forecast day-ahead electricity prices based on Panel Cointegration (PC). The current researches on the electricity price forecasting focus on the analysis of unstable economic time series. However, due to the difference of the allocation of power resource and consumption in different regions, the time series of electricity consumption and sales price in a single region cannot contain all information in different regions.

Pany P.K., Ghosal S.P.;Intelligent systems for dynamic price forecasting in a competitive electricity market;2010;2010 International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control and Robotics, IECR 2010;2;The electric power industry in many countries all around the world is evolving into an era of market economy with deregulation and free competition. The understanding of electric power supply as a public service is being replaced by the notion that a competitive market is a more appropriate mechanism to supply energy to consumers with high reliability and low cost [1]. A key element of the electricity sector restructuring is the establishment of a market-driven price for electricity. The pricing system of electricity plays an important role in a competitive market. In the power market, the electricity price depends on the evolution of balance between the demand for electricity and the available supply. At the same time, many other market factors also influence the electricity price, such as economic growth, weather, the power-plant mix, the prices of fuels and the strategic behavior of large players (usually on the generation side). An active, fully competitive and liquid spot market for wholesale electricity will translate the physical risk of inadequate capacity into a financial risk of high prices and place higher requirements on price forecasting. Producers and consumers rely on price-forecasting information to propose their corresponding bidding strategies. If a producer has an accurate forecast of the prices, it can develop a bidding strategy to maximize its profit. On the other hand, a consumer can make a plan to minimize his own electricity cost if an accurate price forecast is available. © 2010 IEEE.;"Autoregressive moving average; Conventional wavelet neural network; Dilation and translation; Lolac linear wavelet neural network";"Autoregressive moving average; Bidding strategy; Competitive electricity markets; Competitive markets; Conventional wavelet neural network; Dilation and translation; Dynamic price; Economic growths; Electric power industries; Electric power supply; Electricity costs; Electricity prices; Electricity sector restructuring; Financial risks; High price; High reliability; Key elements; Lolac linear wavelet neural network; Low costs; Market economies; Market factors; Physical risks; Power markets; Price forecasting; Price forecasts; Pricing systems; Public services; Spot market; Strategic Behavior; Wholesale electricity; Commerce; Competition; Deregulation; Economics; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Electricity; Industrial electronics; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Power quality; Profitability; Robotics; Weather forecasting; Costs";4, 5;1;1;1
Giri R., Chowdhury A., Ghosh A., Panigrahi B.K., Mohapatra A.;Electricity price forecasting: A hybrid wavelet transform and evolutionary-ANN approach;2010;2010 Joint International Conference on Power Electronics, Drives and Energy Systems, PEDES 2010 and 2010 Power India;1;In a restructured power market, the forecasting of price of electricity has drawn attention of researchers for an accurate forecasting of the electricity price. Electricity price forecast provides important information to the electricity market managers and participants. However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its non-linear, non-stationary, and time variant behavior. In spite of performed research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this article a novel technique has been proposed to forecast the electricity prices using wavelet transform and a Feed-Forward Neural Network trained by a Meta heuristic algorithm i.e. Invasive Weed Optimization technique (IWO). The wavelet transform has been used to decompose ill-behaved price series in a set of better constitutive series. Here we have used the data of electricity market of Australia in year 2005 and the reported results have been compared with the ANN, trained by back propagation algorithm. © 2010 IEEE.;"ANN; Electricity market; IWO; Metaheuristics; Price forecasting; Wavelet transform";"ANN; Electricity market; IWO; Meta heuristics; Price forecasting; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Heuristic algorithms; Neural networks; Power electronics; Wavelet transforms";4, 5;1;1;1

Due to the day-time variations in load and thereby electrical energy price, it is wise to use different models for forecasting energy price at different hours. In this paper, three different single-hour models are used to forecast electricity price at off peak, plateau, and peak load. A 24-hour model is also used to forecast electricity price of all hours simultaneously. Analysis of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions suggests different models for each single hour model as well as the 24-hour model. The best models for off peak, plateau, and peak load are obtained to be ARIMA(1,1,1), ARIMA(2,1,1) and ARIMA(0,1,1), respectively. In addition, the time-series analyses result in an AR(2) model with 24-hour period for the 24-hour model as the most suitable model. The models are compared from viewpoints of accuracy and time consuming. The comparison shows that the user should compromise between accuracy and speed, when selecting singlehour or 24-hour models. ©2010 IEEE.;"Autocorrelation; Electrical energy; Forecasting; Partial autocorrelation; Time series";"Best model; Electrical energy; Electricity prices; Energy prices; Partial autocorrelation; Partial autocorrelation function; Peak load; Power markets; Time variations; Adaptive filtering; Autocorrelation; Costs; Harmonic analysis; Regression analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Electric load forecasting";4;1;1;1

Wang R., Wang F., Ji W.;Particle swarm optimization based GM(1,2) method on day-ahead electricity price forecasting with predicted error improvement;2010;2010 2nd International Workshop on Database Technology and Applications, DBTA2010 - Proceedings;1;Under deregulated environment, accurate electricity price forecasting is a crucial issue concerned by all participants. Experience shows that single forecasting model is very difficult to improve the forecasting accuracy due to the complicated factors affecting electricity prices. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) based GM(1,2) method on day-ahead electricity price forecasting with predicted error improvement is proposed, in which the moving average method is used to process the raw series, the PSO based GM(1,2) model to the processed series and the time series analysis to further improve the predicted errors. The numerical example based on the historical data of the PJM market shows that the method can reflect the characteristics of electricity price better and the forecasting accuracy can be improved virtually compared with the conventional GM(1,2) model.

Haugom E., Westgaard S., Solibakke P.B., Lien G.;Modelling day ahead nord pool forward price volatility: Realized volatility versus GARCH models;2010;2010 7th International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM 2010;5;Traditionally, and still within electricity futures/forward markets, daily data has been utilized as the unit of analyses when modelling and making predictions of volatility. However, over the recent past it is argued that better volatility estimates can be obtained by using standard time series techniques on non-parametric volatility measures constructed from high-frequency intradaily returns. Liquidity in financial electricity markets has increased rapidly over the recent years, which make it possible to apply these relatively new methods for measuring market volatility. In this paper high-frequency data and the concept of realized volatility is utilized to make day ahead predictions of Nord Pool forward price volatility. Such short term volatility predictions are especially important for operators and other participants in the electricity sector. We compare the results obtained from standard time-series techniques with the more traditional GARCH-framework which utilizes daily returns. Additionally, we examine whether different approaches of decomposing the total variation into a continuous - and jump measure improves the model fit or not. The paper provides new insights to how the financial electricity market at Nord Pool works, and how we efficiently can model and make predictions of the price movements in this market. © 2010 IEEE.;"Electricity forward prices; GARCH; High-frequency; Long memory; Nord pool; Realized volatility";"Forward price; GARCH; High frequency HF; Long memories; Nord pool; Realized volatility; Costs; Electric industry; Electricity; Forecasting; Lakes; Time series; Commerce";4;1;1;0
Shrestha G.B., Qiao S.;Statistical characterization of electricity price in competitive power markets;2010;2010 IEEE 11th International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems, PMAPS 2010;8;Forecasting of electricity price in the competitive power market has become very important for the market participants in order to support their planning and operations activities. In addition to the change in prices caused by the demand levels (reflected in normal interaction between supply and demand), numerous other factors affect the electricity price including the sudden surges in prices which are frequently caused by unexpected outages. This paper attempts to represent the price at any one period as a random variable which may be treated statistically. Historical price data from Singapore market (USEP) are used to study the behavior of the market price in order to identify the possible statistical distributions and then hypothesis tests are formulated and carried out to determine the theoretical distributions which are best supported by the historical data. It is shown that the raw price data may not be directly amenable to statistical representation. However, suitable processing of the data such as filtering out the extreme values or suitable regrouping of the data may be carried out to bring out the underlying statistical characteristics of the price behavior. It is shown that the market price behavior may support more than one theoretical distribution although the log normal distribution was found to fit the historical data best. ©2010 IEEE.;"Competitive electricity market; Electricity price; Hypothesis testing; Statistical distributions - normal, log-normal, and weibull distributions";"Competitive electricity markets; Competitive power markets; Electricity price; Electricity prices; Extreme value; Historical data; Hypothesis testing; Hypothesis tests; Log-normal distribution; Market participants; Market price; Singapore; Statistical characteristics; Statistical characterization; Statistical distribution; Statistical representations; Supply and demand; Commerce; Data processing; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Normal distribution; Random variables; Statistical tests; Statistics; Weibull distribution; Costs";4;1;1;1
Abdollahzade M., Mahjoob M.J., Zarringhalam R., Miranian A.;Locally linear neuro-fuzzy (LLNF) electricity price forecasting in deregulated power markets;2010;International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control;17;The disguise of traditional monopolistic electricity markets into deregulated competitive ones has made 'price forecasting' a crucial strategy for both producers and consumers: for the producers, to maximize their profit and hedge against price volatilities and for the consumers to manage their utility. Electricity price forecasting has thus emerged as a progressive field of study and numerous researches have been conducted to improve and optimize the price forecast methods. This paper proposes a precise and computationally efficient method to perform price forecasting in deregulated power markets. A locally linear neuro-fuzzy model is developed for price forecasting. The model is trained by a locally linear model tree (LOLIMOT) learning algorithm. An appropriate input selection based on correlation analysis is considered to develop the model. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed model, three major power markets almost serving as global benchmarks for price forecasting studies are tested and the results are verified using real observed data for various forecasting scenarios. Furthermore, the performance of the suggested model is comprehensively compared to the most recent studies available in the literature using various assessment criteria.

Erlwein C., Benth F.E., Mamon R.;HMM filtering and parameter estimation of an electricity spot price model;2010;Energy Economics;35;In this paper we develop a model for electricity spot price dynamics. The spot price is assumed to follow an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with an added compound Poisson process. In this way, the model allows for mean-reversion and possible jumps. All parameters are modulated by a hidden Markov chain in discrete time. They are able to switch between different economic regimes representing the interaction of various factors. Through the application of reference probability technique, adaptive filters are derived, which in turn, provide optimal estimates for the state of the Markov chain and related quantities of the observation process. The EM algorithm is applied to find optimal estimates of the model parameters in terms of the recursive filters. We implement this self-calibrating model on a deseasonalised series of daily spot electricity prices from the Nordic exchange Nord Pool. On the basis of one-step ahead forecasts, we found that the model is able to capture the empirical characteristics of Nord Pool spot prices. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.;"Adaptive filters; Electricity spot price; Forecasting; Hidden Markov model; Parameter estimation";"Compound Poisson process; Discrete time; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; EM algorithms; Hidden Markov chains; Markov Chain; Mean-reversion; Model parameters; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Recursive filters; Reference probability; Self-calibrating; Spot price; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Algorithms; Costs; Electric filters; Electric load forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Lakes; Metal analysis; Optimization; Poisson distribution; Parameter estimation; algorithm; electricity supply; energy market; estimation method; forecasting method; Markov chain; modeling; parameterization; probability";3, 4;1;1;1

Wu L., Shahidehpour M.;A hybrid model for day-ahead price forecasting;2010;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;120;This paper presents a hybrid time-series and adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) model for the day-ahead electricity market clearing price forecast. Instead of using price series, one-period continuously compounded return series is used to achieve more attractive statistical properties. The autoregressive moving average with exogenous variables (ARMAX) model is used to catch the linear relationship between price return series and explanatory variable load series, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) model is used to unveil the heteroscedastic character of residuals, and AWNN is used to present the nonlinear, nonstationary impact of load series on electricity prices. The Monte Carlo method is adopted to generate more evenly distributed random numbers used for time series and AWNN models to accelerate the convergence.

Karsaz A., Mashhadi H.R., Mirsalehi M.M.;Market clearing price and load forecasting using cooperative co-evolutionary approach;2010;International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems;25;The deregulation of electric power supply industries has raised many challenging problems. One of the most important ones is forecasting the market clearing price (MCP) of electricity. Decisions on various issues, such as to buy or sell electricity and to offer a transaction to the market, require accurate knowledge of the MCP. Another problem, which has also been an important issue of the traditional power systems, is load forecasting for both short and long terms. In this paper, a new forecasting method is introduced to predict the next day electricity price and load. The proposed method is based on cooperative co-evolutionary (Co-Co) approach and has been applied to the real power market. Most of the conventional forecasting methods are based on a single neural network prediction. These methods might misrepresent parts of the input-output data mapping that could have been correctly represented by cooperation of multiple networks. In this paper, a new Co-Co adaptive algorithm with adjustable connections in a recursive procedure is proposed. The obtained results show significant improvement in both price and load forecasting. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Niu D., Liu D., Wu D.D.;A soft computing system for day-ahead electricity price forecasting;2010;Applied Soft Computing Journal;47;Hourly energy prices in a competitive electricity market are volatile. Forecast of energy price is key information to help producers and purchasers involved in electricity market to prepare their corresponding bidding strategies so as to maximize their profits. It is difficult to forecast all the hourly prices with only one model for different behaviors of different hourly prices. Neither will it get excellent results with 24 different models to forecast the 24 hourly prices respectively, for there are always not sufficient data to train the models, especially the peak price in summer. This paper proposes a novel technique to forecast day-ahead electricity prices based on Self-Organizing Map neural network (SOM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. SOM is used to cluster the data automatically according to their similarity to resolve the problem of insufficient training data. SVM models for regression are built on the categories clustered by SOM separately. Parameters of the SVM models are chosen by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automatically to avoid the arbitrary parameters decision of the tester, improving the forecasting accuracy. The comparison suggests that SOM-SVM-PSO has considerable value in forecasting day-ahead price in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market, especially for summer peak prices. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Amjady N., Daraeepour A., Keynia F.;Day-ahead electricity price forecasting by modified relief algorithm and hybrid neural network;2010;IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution;118;In a power market, the price of electricity is the most important signal to all market participants. However, electricity price forecast is a complex task due to non-linearity, non-stationarity and volatility of the price signal. In spite of all performed research on this area in the recent years, there is still an essential need for more accurate price forecast methods. Besides, there is a lack of robust feature selection technique for designing the input vector of electricity price forecast, which can consider the non-linearities of the price signal. In this study, a new price forecast method is proposed, which is composed of a modified version of Relief algorithm for feature selection and a hybrid neural network for prediction.

RNN is a multi-step approach based on one output node, which uses the previous prediction as input for the subsequent forecasts. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed RNN model is done with respect to SD method and other literatures. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed RNN approach in forecasting short-term electricity prices, different criteria are used. Mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of reasonably small values were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. Error variance, one of the important performance criteria, is also calculated in order to measure robustness of the proposed RNN model. The numerical results obtained through the simulation to forecast next 24 and 72 h electricity prices show that the forecasts generated by the proposed RNN model are significantly accurate and efficient, which confirm that the proposed algorithm performs well for shortterm price forecasting.

Pirino D., Renò R.;Electricity prices: A nonparametric approach;2010;International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance;3;"We propose a simple univariate model for the dynamics of spot electricity prices. The model is nonparametric in the sense that it is free from parametric model assumptions and flexible in capturing the dynamics of the data. The estimation is performed in two steps. Preliminarily, spikes are identified by means of an iterative filtering technique. The series of spikes is used to estimate a seasonal spike intensity function and fitted with an exponential law. We then implement Nadaraya-Watson estimators for the drift and the diffusion coefficients on the filtered series. Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate estimation errors. We fit the model on European and American time series of spot day-ahead electricity prices; in spite of the simplicity of the proposed model, our specification tests indicate successful goodness-of-fit. We provide evidence for mean-reversion, nonlinear volatility and seasonal spike intensity; moreover we find that American markets show a very low level of mean reversion and a lower volatility with respect to their European counterparts. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.";;;4;0;1;0
Vahidinasab V., Jadid S.;Bayesian neural network model to predict day-ahead electricity prices;2010;European Transactions on Electrical Power;15;Market participants in the new competitive electricity markets find price forecasting so valuable in developing their bidding strategies. In this paper, the Bayesian neural network (BNN) approach is proposed for day-ahead prediction of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the pool based energy markets, in which to select the optimum inputs of the BNN, the correlation coefficient technique is used. LMP has a volatile and time dependent behavior. Hence, prediction of such a complex signal is a challenging task requiring a qualified forecasting tool, which not only fits well to the training data, but also can predict the stochastic behavior of unseen part of the signal. The proposed Bayesian approach to predict day-ahead electricity prices presents noteworthy advantages over the classical neural networks (NN) methods which include the avoidance of network overfitting, an indication of the degree of uncertainty in the predictions, automatic selection of an appropriate scale for network weights and, accordingly, selection of the optimal forecasting model. Examining the proposed forecast strategy on the different periods of the Pennsylvania- New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can provide more accurate results than the other price forecasting techniques, such as, ARIMA time series, wavelet-ARIMA, classical NN, and also a similar day method.

Combining the Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) and Orthogonal Experimental Design (OED), an Enhanced Radial Basis Function Network (ERBFN) has been proposed for the solving process. The Locational Marginal Price (LMP), system load, transmission flow and temperature of the PJM system were collected and the data clusters were embedded in the Excel Database according to the year, season, workday and weekend. With the OED applied to learning rates in the ERBFN, the forecasting error can be reduced during the training process to improve both accuracy and reliability. This would mean that even the ""spikes"" could be tracked closely.

In this study, support vector machine (SVM) has been used as a function approximation tool for a price series and genetic algorithm (GA) has been utilised for optimisation of the parameters of the SVM model. Instead of using single time series, separate time series for each trading interval has been employed to model each day's price profile, and SVM parameters of these separate series have been optimised using GA. The developed model has been applied to two large power systems from National electricity market (NEM) of Australia. The forecasting performance of the proposed model has been compared with a heuristic technique, a linear regression model and the other reported works in the literature. Effect of price volatility on the performance of the models has also been analysed. Testing results show that the proposed GA-SVM model has better forecasting ability than the other forecasting techniques. © 2009 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.;;"Australia; Developed model; Forecasting ability; Forecasting models; Forecasting performance; Forecasting techniques; Function approximation; Heuristic techniques; Input-output; Large power systems; Linear regression models; National electricity markets; Optimisations; Parameter optimisation; Parameter selection; Price volatility; Single time series; SVM model; Testing results; Ability testing; Approximation algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Linear regression; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Support vector machines; Technological forecasting; Time series; Electric load forecasting";5;1;1;1

High probability of volatility in wholesale electricity prices and trends that are generally non-uniform create challenges when forecasting future prices using simple backpropagation feedforward ANN. A number of ANN architectures and training methods have been proposed for a variety of applications, and here we consider three approaches with actual electricity price data. The architectures considered in this study are: the well known feedforward and Elman networks trained with backpropagation, which are compared to feedforward network trained with genetic algorithm. Avoidance of local minima and minimization of computational cost are key performance indicators in ANN training. Number of training iterations needed to achieve target error and the generalization ability are used to compare the methods.

Jónsson T., Pinson P., Madsen H.;Day-ahead electricity prices in Denmark: The impact fo wind power forecasts;2009;European Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition 2009, EWEC 2009;1;An analysis of how day-ahead electricity spot prices are affected by day-ahead wind power forecasts is presented. Demonstration of this relationship is given as a test case for the Western Danish price area of the Nord Pool's Elspot market. Impact on the average price behavior is investigated as well as that on the distributional properties of the price. By using a non-parametric regression model to assess the effects of wind power forecasts on the average behavior, the non-linearities and time variations in the relationship are captured well and the effects are shown to be quite substantial. Furthermore, by evaluating the distributional properties of the spot prices under different scenarios, the impact of the wind power forecasts on the price distribution is proven to be considerable. The conditional price distribution is moreover shown to be non-Gaussian. This implies that forecasting models for electricity spot prices for which parameters are estimated by a least squares techniques will not have Gaussian residuals. Hence the widespread assumption of Gaussian residuals from electricity spot price models is shown to be inadequate for these model types. The revealed effects are likely to be observable and qualitatively similar in other day-ahead electricity markets significantly penetrated by wind power.;"Coditional distributions; Electricity spot prices; Impact of wind power; Locally weighted polynomial regression";"Average behavior; Coditional distributions; Day-ahead electricity market; Denmark; Distributional property; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Forecasting models; Gaussians; Least squares techniques; Non-Gaussian; Non-parametric regression; Spot price; Test case; Time variations; Weighted polynomials; Wind power forecast; Costs; Electricity; Exhibitions; Regression analysis; Wind power; Weather forecasting";4;1;1;1

Market clearing price (MCP) forecasting has been more and more significant in new restructured market because both generating companies and consumers rely on it to prepare their bidding strategies and expect to maximize respective benefits with low risks. But the prediction of MCP is complex because various uncertainties interact in an intricate way. Hence, ANN is proposed to solve high complicated nonlinear problems like MCP forecasting due to its powerful capability of learning mechanism if enough data for training.

Filho J.C.R., Affonso C.M., Oliveira R.C.L.;Pricing analysis in the Brazilian energy market: A decision tree approach;2009;2009 IEEE Bucharest PowerTech: Innovative Ideas Toward the Electrical Grid of the Future;10;There is a general consensus that electricity price forecasting is an important task nowadays since power market players are interested in the maximization of profit and the minimization of risk. In this context, this paper proposes the use of Data-Mining techniques to predict the short-term electricity price in the Brazilian market. In Brazil, the market model adopted has unique characteristics with a centralized form of dispatch due to the predominance of hydro generation. To apply the proposed prediction model, all features of the Brazilian electricity market are considered, such as the transmission restrictions among geo-electrical regions and the price dependency with storage energy in reservoirs. In the proposed prediction model, the electricity price is the dependent variable and the monthly time series data sets from the Brazilian system (such as power load, stored energy and thermal generation) are the independent variables. First, clustering of the data samples is performed to group similar behavior of the attributes. After that, a decision tree algorithm is applied to extract if-then rules from database. The rules obtained allow the identification of attributes that most influence the short-term electricity price. Results show that the proposed model can be an attractive tool to all electricity market players to forecast the short-term electricity price and mitigate the risks in purchasing power. © 2009 IEEE.;"Clustering; Data-mining; Decision trees; Short-term electricity price forecasting";"Brazilian electricity markets; Brazilian system; Clustering; Clustering data; Data sample; Decision-tree algorithm; Dependent variables; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Energy markets; Hydro generation; If-then rules; Independent variables; Market model; Power load; Power markets; Prediction model; Purchasing power; Storage energy; Stored energy; Thermal generation; Time-series data; Cluster analysis; Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Mathematical models; Profitability; Time series; Electric generators";4, 5;1;1;0
Lei M., Feng Z.;A novel grey model to short-term electricity price forecasting for NordPool power market;2009;Conference Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics;2;In order to improve the forecasting precision of traditional grey model for Short-term price in competitive electricity market, a novel grey model is presented in this paper based on period-decoupled price sequence. According to the interval time of market cleaning, the historical price data are divided into 24 sequences or 48 sequences. In the proposed grey model, two kinds of price sequences, called the main sequence (MS) and the reference sequence (RS), are defined. The correlation coefficient between price sequences of adjacent time intervals is analyzed, which is more than 0.9522 obtained from the Nordpool data in 2007. Therefore, it is determined that the MS is composed of prediction-period price data, and the RS is composed of hour-before-period price data. Furthermore, considering the limitation of the least square method (LSM) used in the traditional grey model for identification the developing coefficient a and the grey input b, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is adopted instead of LSM. Thus the PSOGM (1,2) forecasting model to short-term price is founded. The historical data from the Nordpool power market is used for computing, and the numerical results demonstrate that the MAPE of PSOGM (1,2) model for short-term price rolling prediction is 5.0626% and 7.5491% for continuous forecasting, raising 3%~20% compared with traditional grey model. ©2009 IEEE.;"Electrcity price forecasting; Grey model; Particle swarm optimization; Power market";"Competitive electricity markets; Correlation coefficient; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting models; Forecasting precision; Grey Model; Historical data; Interval time; Least square methods; Numerical results; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Power markets; Price forecasting; Time interval; Commerce; Costs; Cybernetics; Electric load forecasting; Least squares approximations; Rapid solidification; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)";4;1;1;1

Amjady N., Keynia F.;Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by a new feature selection algorithm and cascaded neural network technique;2009;Energy Conversion and Management;43;With the introduction of restructuring into the electric power industry, the price of electricity has become the focus of all activities in the power market. Electricity price forecast is key information for electricity market managers and participants. However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its non-linear, non-stationary, and time variant behavior. In spite of performed research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this paper, a new forecast strategy is proposed for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets. Our forecast strategy is composed of a new two stage feature selection technique and cascaded neural networks. The proposed feature selection technique comprises modified Relief algorithm for the first stage and correlation analysis for the second stage. The modified Relief algorithm selects candidate inputs with maximum relevancy with the target variable. Then among the selected candidates, the correlation analysis eliminates redundant inputs. Selected features by the two stage feature selection technique are used for the forecast engine, which is composed of 24 consecutive forecasters. Each of these 24 forecasters is a neural network allocated to predict the price of 1 h of the next day. The whole proposed forecast strategy is examined on the Spanish and Australia's National Electricity Markets Management Company (NEMMCO) and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Amjady N., Daraeepour A.;Design of input vector for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets;2009;Expert Systems with Applications;52;In new deregulated electricity market, price forecasts have become a fundamental input to an energy company's decision making and strategy development process. However, the exclusive characteristics of electricity price such as non-stationarity, non-linearity and time-varying volatile structure present a number of challenges for this task. In spite of all performed research on this area in the recent years, there is still essential need for more accurate and robust price forecast methods. Besides, there is a lack of efficient feature selection technique for designing the input vector of electricity price forecast. In this paper, a new two-stage feature selection algorithm composed of modified relief and mutual information (MI) techniques is proposed for this purpose. Moreover, cascaded neural network (CNN) is presented as forecast engine for electricity price prediction. The CNN is composed of cascaded forecasters where each forecaster is a neural network (NN). The proposed feature selection algorithm selects the best set of candidate inputs which is used by the CNN.

Leevongwat I., Rastgoufard P.;Forecasting locational marginal pricing in deregulated power markets;2009;2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition, PSCE 2009;7;This investigation focuses on development of new methodologies for implementing power systems optimization for forecasting Location Marginal Prices (LMP) in deregulated electricity markets. The proposed approach uses the LMP method [1-3] to show relationships between generator bids, power system constraints, and electricity demand. The proposed approach uses Unit Commitment, Economic Dispatch, and Optimal Power Flow to perform load flow analysis that includes LMP calculation to determine price of electricity. This paper includes the main part of the investigation that addresses integration of locational marginal pricing within the traditional structure of optimization constraints including economic constraints, operational and security constraints including system real power balance, unit operating limits, transmission flow limits, interface limits, and contingency constraints. The integration of LMP and the constraints of optimization outlined in this paper may serve as a foundation for inclusion of environmental constraints, system spinning reserve constraints, and system operating reserve constraints in the future.

Mandal P., Srivastava A.K., Negnevitsky M.;Improving performance of NN based electricity price forecasting using sensitivity analysis;2009;2009 IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition, PSCE 2009;3;"This paper focuses on sensitivity analysis of neural network (NN) parameters in order to improve the performance of NN based short-term electricity price forecasting. Sensitivity analysis of NN parameters include back-propagation learning set (BP-set), learning rate (η), momentum (α) and NN learning days (dNN). Presented work is an extended version of previous work done by authors to integrate NN and similar days (SD) method for predicting day-ahead electricity prices. Similar days refer to similar price days, i.e., price data obtained from historical days. Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of similar price days. Similar days method adopts the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. The similar days parameters, i.e., time framework of similar days (d = 45 days) and number of selected similar price days (N = 5) are kept constant for all the simulated cases. Forecasting performance is carried out by choosing a day from each season of the year 2006 randomly, and for which, the NN parameters for the base case are considered as BP-set = 500, η = 0.8, α = 0.1 and dNN = 45 days. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the value of BP-set (500, 1000, 1500); η (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2), α (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and dNN (15, 30, 45 and 60 days). During the sensitivity analysis, the most favorable value of BP-set is first identified followed by that of η and α, and based on which the best value of dNN is determined. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the best value of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained when BP-set = 500, η = 0.8, α = 0.1 and dNN = 60 days for winter season, whereas for spring, summer and autumn, these values are 500, 0.6, 0.1 and 45 days, respectively.

Takeuchi Y., Miyauchi H., Kita T.;Basic studies on chaotic characteristics of electric power market price;2009;IEEJ Transactions on Power and Energy;0;Recently, deregulation and reform of electric power utilities have been progressing in many parts of the world. In Japan, partial deregulation has been started from generation sector since 1995 and partial deregulation of retail sector is executed through twice law revisions. Through the deregulation, because electric power is traded in the market and its price is always fluctuated, it is important for the electric power business to analyze and predict the price. Although the price data of the electric power market is time series data, it is not always proper to analyze by the linear model such as ARMA because the price sometimes changes suddenly. Therefore, in this paper, we apply the methods of chaotic time series analysis, one of non-linear analysis methods and investigate the chaotic characteristics of the system price of JEPX. © 2009 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.;"Deterministic chaos; Electric power market price; Embedding; Fault neighborhood method; Fractal dimension; Lyapunov exponents";"Deterministic chaos; Electric power market price; Embedding; Fault neighborhood method; Lyapunov exponents; Chaotic systems; Commerce; Costs; Differential equations; Electric network analysis; Electric power measurement; Electric power systems; Electricity; Fractal dimension; Lyapunov methods; Partial discharges; Time series; Time series analysis; Deregulation";0;0;1;0
Nguyen H.T., Nabney I.T.;Energy forward price prediction with a hybrid adaptive model;2009;IEEE/IAFE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering, Proceedings (CIFEr);3;This paper presents a forecasting technique for forward electricity/gas prices, one day ahead. This technique combines a Kalman filter (KF) and a generalised autoregressive conditional heteroschedasticity (GARCH) model (often used in financial forecasting). The GARCH model is used to compute next value of a time series. The KF updates parameters of the GARCH model when the new observation is available. This technique is applied to real data from the UK energy markets to evaluate its performance. The results show that the forecasting accuracy is improved significantly by using this hybrid model. The methodology can be also applied to forecasting market clearing prices and electricity/gas loads. © 2009 IEEE.;;"Adaptive models; Auto-regressive; Financial forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting techniques; Forward price; GARCH models; Hybrid model; Market Clearing Price; UK energy market; Artificial intelligence; Control theory; Technological forecasting; Time series; Electric load forecasting";4;1;1;1
Yin K., Gang L.;Model of forecasting system marginal price for power market in southwestern China;2009;Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference, APPEEC;0;System marginal price (SMP) is the uniform price that reflects the short-term relationship between demands and supplies in power markets. To forecast SMP accurately, a computational model based on grey theory was proposed. The model can process irregular original data by accumulated generating operation (AGO) and get regular results. According to the regular results, a computational real-time forecasting system can be established. Test and simulation were completed by MATLAB according to the specific data of SMP from California power market. Considering the possible difference between weekend and workdays, two types of data were singled out randomly to calculate. Results show that the model can provide a great deal of flexibility for applications. The forecasting system has been applied in power market in southwestern China and it has been proved that the reliability, accuracy and real-time performance can be used as needed. © 2009 IEEE.;"Forecasting; Grey theory; SMP";"Accumulated generating operations; California; Computational model; Forecasting system; Grey theory; Power markets; Real time performance; Real-time forecasting; SMP; System marginal price; Term relationship; Uniform price; Commerce; Competition; MATLAB; Shape memory effect; Electric load forecasting";4;1;1;1

Swamp K.S., Singhal D.;Forecasting electricity price volatility using artificial neural networks;2009;Journal of the Institution of Engineers (India): Electrical Engineering Division;0;Forecasting electricity price is a challenging task for on-line trading and e-commerce. Forecasting the hourly market clearing prices (MCP) in daily power markets is the most essential task and basis for any decision making in order to maximize the benefits. Volatility in electricity price in deregulated open power markets and its forecasting using neural networks is presented. Artificial neural networks are found to be most suitable tool as they can map the complex interdependencies between electricity price, historical load, temperature and other factors. The basic idea behind 'neural network approach' is to use history and other estimated factors in the future to 'fit' and 'extrapolate'the prices and quantities. The structure of the neural network is a three-layer back propagation (BP) network. The price forecasting results using the neural network model show that the price of electricity in the deregulated markets can be forecasted with reasonable accuracy.;"Artificial neural networks; Electricity price volatility; Forecasting; Market clearing price (MCP); Open power market; Power trading; Price forecasting";"Electricity prices; Market clearing prices; Power markets; Power trading; Price forecasting; Commerce; Deregulation; Electricity; Forecasting; Neural networks; Costs";5;0;1;0
Mandal P., Srivastava A.K., Negnevitsky M., Park J.-W.;Sensitivity analysis of neural network parameters to improve the performance of electricity price forecasting;2009;International Journal of Energy Research;11;"This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of neural network (NN) parameters to improve the performance of electricity price forecasting. The presented work is an extended version of previous works done by authors to integrate NN and similar days (SD) method for predicting electricity prices. Focus here is on sensitivity analysis of NN parameters while keeping the parameters same for SD to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in the PJM market. Sensitivity analysis of NN parameters include back-propagation learning set (BP-set), learning rate (η), momentum (α) and NN learning days (dN N). The SD parameters, i.e. time framework of SD (d = 45 days) and number of selected similar price days (N=5) are kept constant for all the simulated cases. Forecasting performance is carried out by choosing two different days from each season of the year 2006 and for which, the NN parameters for the base case are considered as BP-set=500, η=0.8, α=0.1 and dNN = 45 days. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the value of BP-set (500, 1000, 1500); η (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2), α (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and dNN (15, 30, 45 and 60 days). The most favorable value of BP-set is first found out from the sensitivity analysis followed by that of η and α, and based on which the best value of dNN is determined. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the best value of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained when BP-set = 500, η= 0.8, α=0.1 and dNN = 60 days for winter season. For spring, summer and autumn, these values are 500, 0.6, 0.1 and 45 days, respectively. MAPE, forecast mean square error and mean absolute error of reasonably small value are obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. Numerical results show that forecasts generated by developed NN model based on the most favorable case are accurate and efficient.

Then, a one-step ahead forecast for each hour of the next day for a test period of three years has been made using the respective hour-time series and by employing a support vector machine. A detailed sensitivity analysis was performed for the selection of model parameters. Furthermore, the performance of a support vector machine model has been compared with a heuristic technique, simulation model, linear regression model, neural network model, neuro-fuzzy model, autoregressive integrated moving average model, dynamic regression model, and transfer function model.

Redl C., Haas R., Huber C., Böhm B.;Price formation in electricity forward markets and the relevance of systematic forecast errors;2009;Energy Economics;65;Since the liberalisation of the European electricity sector, forward and futures contracts have gained significant interest of market participants due to risk management reasons. For pricing of these contracts an important fact concerns the non-storability of electricity. In this case, according to economic theory, forward prices are related to the expected spot prices which are built on fundamental market expectations. In the following article the crucial impact parameters of forward electricity prices and the relationship between forward and future spot prices will be assessed by an empirical analysis of electricity prices at the European Energy Exchange and the Nord Pool Power Exchange. In fact, price formation in the considered markets is influenced by historic spot market prices yielding a biased forecasting power of long-term contracts. Although market and risk assessment measures of market participants and supply and demand shocks can partly explain the futures-spot bias inefficiencies in the analysed forward markets cannot be ruled out. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Amjady N., Keynia F.;Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by mutual information technique and cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm;2009;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;186;In a competitive electricity market, price forecasts are important for market participants. However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variant behavior. In spite of much research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this paper, a combination of a feature selection technique and cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA) is proposed for this purpose. The feature selection method is an improved version of the mutual information (MI) technique. The CNEA is composed of cascaded forecasters where each forecaster consists of a neural network (NN) and an evolutionary algorithm (EA). An iterative search procedure is also incorporated in our solution strategy to fine-tune the adjustable parameters of both the MI technique and CNEA. The price forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated by means of real data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) and Spanish electricity markets. The method is also compared with some of the most recent price forecast techniques. © 2009 IEEE.;"Cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA); Iterative search procedure; Mutual information (MI); Price forecast";"Algorithms; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Marketing; Neural networks; Adjustable parameters; Cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA); Competitive electricity markets; Complex signals; Day-ahead prices; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Feature selection methods; Feature selections; Iterative search procedure; Market participants; Mutual information (MI); Neural-network; New jerseys; Non linearities; Non-stationarity; Price forecast; Solution strategies; Time variants; Evolutionary algorithms";5;1, 2;1;1
Amjady N., Hemmati M.;Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by a hybrid intelligent system;2009;European Transactions on Electrical Power;59;Price forecasting is so valuable for both producers and consumers in the new competitive electric power markets. In this paper, a new hybrid intelligent system (HIS) is proposed for day-ahead prediction of market clearing price (MCP) in the pool-based markets. MCP has a volatile and time-dependent behavior owning many outliers. Prediction of such a complex signal is a challenging task requiring a qualified forecast tool, which not only fits well to the training data, but also can predict the stochastic behavior of the unseen part of the signal. The proposed hybrid system is composed of a real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA), cross-validation, repetitive training, and archiving techniques combined in the framework of a neural network (NN). The proposed RCGA with enhanced stochastic search capability is used for training of the NN while the cross-validation, repetitive training and archiving techniques enhances generalization capability of it. The proposed forecast strategy is examined on the different periods of the Spanish electricity market. It is shown that the method can provide more accurate results than the other price forecasting techniques such as ARIMA time series, wavelet-ARIMA, fuzzy neural network (FNN), and generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) methods.

Diongue A.K., Guégan D., Vignal B.;Forecasting electricity spot market prices with a k-factor GIGARCH process;2009;Applied Energy;53;In this article, we investigate conditional mean and conditional variance forecasts using a dynamic model following a k-factor GIGARCH process. Particularly, we provide the analytical expression of the conditional variance of the prediction error. We apply this method to the German electricity price market for the period August 15, 2000-December 31, 2002 and we test spot prices forecasts until one-month ahead forecast. The forecasting performance of the model is compared with a SARIMA-GARCH benchmark model using the year 2003 as the out-of-sample. The proposed model outperforms clearly the benchmark model. We conclude that the k-factor GIGARCH process is a suitable tool to forecast spot prices, using the classical RMSE criteria. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Yamashita D., Mohd Isa A., Yokoyama R., Niimura T.;Forecasting of electricity price and demand using auto-regressive neural networks;2008;IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC-PapersOnline);0;This paper proposes a forecasting technique of electricity demand and price with volatility based on neural networks. Recent deregulation and liberalization are worldwide currents in the electric industry. The price competition was introduced in a spot market, and the price volatility is concerned because the demand side is non-elastic, and electricity differs from other general commodities. The authors firstly predict an uncertain electric power demand by using the auto-regressive model of the neural networks. The neural network is a popular feed-forward three-layer model, and the input variables of the neural networks include the historical demand, temperature, weather-related discomfort index, and the day of the week. Secondly, by using the demand forecasted and the past prices, we apply the technique for forecasting the electricity price of the next day. The utility of the proposed technique was verified by using real data of the electric power wholesale spot market.

Zhang J., Cheng C.;Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using artificial intelligence;2008;2008 IEEE Electrical Power and Energy Conference - Energy Innovation;9;Accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DEPF) has significant meanings in deregulated electrical power market due to its profitable function for all the participants to make reasonable decisions during the market business activities. However, the DEPF with satisfactory precision is difficult to be gained because of the violent volatility of electricity price caused by many factors. In this study, a multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks model is constructed for the DEPF in spot market of Nord Pool which is one of the most successful electrical power markets in the world. The major influencing factors are chosen by statistical methods called auto correlation function (ACF) and cross correlation function (CCF), and the standard error back-propagation algorithm is improved by using self-adaptive learning rate and self-adaptive momentum coefficient algorithm to make the training process more efficient both in global optimization and time saving. The most suitable structure of the network is determined by a trial-and-error experiment minimizing MAPE and MSRE of the network and several commonly used error indicators are employed to evaluate the goodness of fit performance of the model. The case study indicates that the DEPF of the proposed model is more reasonable and accurate, comparing with that of traditional ARIMA model. © 2008 IEEE.;"ARIMA; Artificial neural networks; Electricity price forecasting; Nord Pool; Self-adaptive algorithm";"Adaptive algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Costs; Deregulation; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electricity; Global optimization; Lakes; Learning algorithms; Marketing; Multilayer neural networks; ARIMA; Artificial neural networks; Electricity price forecasting; Nord Pool; Self-adaptive algorithm; Electric load forecasting";5;1;1;1

Aggarwal S.K., Saini L.M., Kumar A.;Price forecasting using wavelet transform and LSE based mixed model in Australian electricity market;2008;International Journal of Energy Sector Management;18;Purpose - Price forecasting is essential for risk management in deregulated electricity markets. The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid technique using wavelet transform (WT) and multiple linear regression (MLR) to forecast price profile in electricity markets. Design/methodology/approach - Price series is highly volatile and non-stationary in nature. In this work, initially complete price series has been decomposed into separate 48 half-hourly series and then these series have been categorized into different segments for price forecasting. For some segments, WT based MLR has been applied and for the other segments, simple MLR model has been applied. The model is general in nature and has been implemented for one day-ahead price forecasting in National Electricity Market (NEM) of Australia. Participants can use the technique practically, since it predicts price well before submission of bids. Findings - Forecasting performance of the proposed WT and MLR based mixed model has been compared with the three other models, an analytical model, a MLR model and an artificial neural network (ANN) based model. The proposed model was found to be better. Performance evaluation for different wavelets was performed, and it has been observed that for improving forecasting accuracy using WT, Daubechies wavelet of order two gives the best performance. Originality/value - Forecasting accuracy improvement of an established technique by incorporating time domain and wavelet domain variables of the same time series into one set has been implemented in this work. The paper also attempts to explain how non-stationarity can be removed from a non-stationary time series by applying WT after appropriate statistical investigation. Moreover, real time electricity markets are highly unpredictable and yet under investigated. The model has been applied to NEM for the same reason. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Australia; Correlation analysis; Demand forecasting; Electricity industry; Financial forecasting; Volatility";"Backpropagation; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electricity; Forecasting; Fourier transforms; Marketing; Network performance; Neural networks; Risk analysis; Risk management; Time series; Wavelet transforms; Australia; Correlation analysis; Demand forecasting; Electricity industry; Financial forecasting; Volatility; Electric load forecasting";4;1;1;1

In the electricity market, system marginal price is not a parameter that varies according to normal rules. It not only has relations to load curve, available generation capacity, bidding mode, system and unit of the generation companies, but also is in reference to price of commodities, inflation and so on. As we can not use mathematic mode to express the diversity and randomicity of factors which reflects electricity price, it is difficult to predict electricity price accurately. In recent years, as the chaotic theory develops, especially speaking, applying chaotic theory to load forecasting offers a new tool to study the stochastic evolution of electricity price. Furthermore, people reveal the regularity that the evolution of both electricity price time series and load time series indicates the chaotic nature, which hiding in these time series themselves. It offers foundation for predicting electricity price by using phase space reconstruction. This paper analyzes the basic character of the system marginal price time series in greater depth. Then, according to the theory of phase space reconstruction, it makes use of the time series of electricity price data, adopts adding weight one-rank local region method, does not consider the stochastic factor related to electricity price, directly analyzes historical data of the electricity price that contains all factors, and carries on forestation based on acquired objective regularity. We carry on the prediction on the historical data from California electricity market, analyze and draw a detailed comparison with existing forecasting methods such as BP algorithm and LS-VSM algorithm, which shows that mean absolute percentage error reduce 22.6% and 12.8% respectively. Therefore, this method can acquire a better forecasting result. ©2008 IEEE.;"Adding weight one-rank local region method; Chaos; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; System marginal price";"Backpropagation algorithms; Boolean functions; Chaotic systems; Competition; Costs; Electric load forecasting; Electric power systems; Electricity; Forecasting; Marketing; Phase space methods; Restoration; Stochastic programming; Technology transfer; Time series analysis; Adding weight one-rank local region method; Chaos; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; System marginal price; Electric network analysis";0;1;1;1
Chan K.F., Gray P., van Campen B.;A new approach to characterizing and forecasting electricity price volatility;2008;International Journal of Forecasting;45;There is a growing need to model the dynamics of electricity spot prices. While many studies have adopted the jump-diffusion model used successfully in traditional financial markets, the distinctive features of energy prices present non-trivial challenges. In particular, electricity price series feature extreme jumps of magnitudes rarely seen in financial markets, and occurring at greater frequency. Standard parametric approaches to estimating jump-diffusion models struggle to disentangle the jump and non-jump variation. This paper explores a recently-developed approach to separating the total variation into jump and non-jump components. Using quadratic variation theory, we non-parametrically estimate jump parameters for five power markets which are known to feature some important physical differences. The unique characteristics of the jump and non-jump components of the total variation are studied for each market. Given the evidence that the two sources of variation in spot prices have distinct dynamics, the paper explores whether volatility forecasts can be improved by explicitly incorporating the jump and non-jump components of the total variation. © 2008 International Institute of Forecasters.;"Bipower variation; Jumps; Quadratic variation; Realized volatility; Volatility forecast";;3, 4;0;1;1

The methods considered include standard autoregression (AR) models and their extensions - spike preprocessed, threshold and semiparametric autoregressions (i.e., AR models with nonparametric innovations) - as well as mean-reverting jump diffusions. The methods are compared using a time series of hourly spot prices and system-wide loads for California, and a series of hourly spot prices and air temperatures for the Nordic market. We find evidence that (i) models with system load as the exogenous variable generally perform better than pure price models, but that this is not necessarily the case when air temperature is considered as the exogenous variable; and (ii) semiparametric models generally lead to better point and interval forecasts than their competitors, and more importantly, they have the potential to perform well under diverse market conditions. © 2008 International Institute of Forecasters.";"Autoregressive model; Conditional coverage; Electricity market; Interval forecasts; Nonparametric maximum likelihood; Price forecasts";;3, 4;1;1;1, 2
Aggarwal S.K., Saini L.M., Kumar A.;Electricity price forecasting in ontario electricity market using wavelet transform in artificial neural network based model;2008;International Journal of Control, Automation and Systems;47;Electricity price forecasting has become an integral part of power system operation and control. In this paper, a wavelet transform (WT) based neural network (NN) model to forecast price profile in a deregulated electricity market has been presented. The historical price data has been decomposed into wavelet domain constitutive sub series using WT and then combined with the other time domain variables to form the set of input variables for the proposed forecasting model. The behavior of the wavelet domain constitutive series has been studied based on statistical analysis. It has been observed that forecasting accuracy can be improved by the use of WT in a forecasting model. Multi-scale analysis from one to seven levels of decomposition has been performed and the empirical evidence suggests that accuracy improvement is highest at third level of decomposition. Forecasting performance of the proposed model has been compared with (i) a heuristic technique, (ii) a simulation model used by Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), (iii) a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model, (iv) NN model, (v) Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, (vi) Dynamic Regression (DR) model, and (vii) Transfer Function (TF) model.

Bashir Z.A., El-Hawary M.E.;Locational marginal pricing prediction in a competitve electrical market using computational intelligence;2008;Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering;1;Deregulation has created a competitive market among power market participants, and the pricing system plays an important role. Locational marginal pricing (LMP) provides clear market signals that identify the locations where power market participants could make their decisions so as to maximize their profits. In this work, artificial neural networks (ANNs) models are used to predict hourly LMP. ANN is trained using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO aims to minimize the error function by adjusting neural network's weights and biases using a stochastic optimal search. Wavelet transformed data is fed into neural network as pre-processing stage in order to get a better price pattern that will be reliable for forecasting. The historical LMP and corresponding load demand and temperature are trained, validated and tested over a period of one season. The efficient generalization of proposed model is investigated using early stopping technique. The results were compared with neural models using conventional back-propagation (BP) algorithm and radial basis function (RBF) and yielded encouraging results. © 2008 IEEE.;"Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Predicted hourly LMP; Wavelet transform";"Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Data processing; Deregulation; Electric fault location; Electric load forecasting; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Image classification; Lightning; Marketing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; Technology; Vegetation; Artificial neural networks; Competitive markets; Computational intelligence; Early stopping; Electrical and computer engineering; Error functions; Load demand; Locational marginal pricing; Neural modeling; Optimal search; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Particle swarm optimization algorithms; Power markets; Pre-processing; Predicted hourly LMP; Radial-basis function; Wavelet transform; Wavelet transformed data; Neural networks";4, 5;1;1;1
Amjady N., Daraeepour A.;Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using the relief algorithm and neural networks;2008;2008 5th International Conference on the European Electricity Market, EEM;6;In a competitive electricity market, forecast of energy prices is a key information for the market participants. However, price signal usually has a complex behavior due to its nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variancy. In spite of all performed researches on this area in the recent years, there is still an essential need for more accurate and robust price forecast methods. In this paper, a combination of a feature selection technique and Neural Network (NN) is proposed for this purpose. The feature selection method is a modified version of the Relief algorithm, proposed for the feature selection of price forecasting. Then, by means of the most relevant, explanatory and irredundant features, a Neural Network (NN) predicts the next values of the price signal. The adjustable parameters of the whole method are fine-tuned by a cross-validation technique. The proposed method is examined on PJM electricity market, forecasting day-ahead locational marginal prices (LMPs), and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods especially some other popular and validated feature selection techniques.

Huisman R.;The influence of temperature on spike probability in day-ahead power prices;2008;Energy Economics;32;It is well known that day-ahead prices in power markets exhibit spikes and time-varying volatility. Spikes and extremely high volatility are the results of (short-term) frictions in demand and/or supply conditions. It is known that information on load or the reserve margin help to forecast spikes. However, these variables are not (timely) available for every market participant and this paper suggests to use temperature as a proxy. Interpreting the results from several switching-regimes models, the paper shows that the probability of spike occurrence increases when temperature deviates substantially from mean temperature levels. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Hong L., Hao X., Weiguo L., Yi S., Guoyi X.;A power price forecasting method based on nonparametric GARCH model;2008;3rd International Conference on Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies, DRPT 2008;3;Based on nonparametric conditional heteroscedasticity estimation theory, an improved power price forecasting method is proposed in this paper. In this method, according to the practical power price curve, conditional variance function is built and the model is determined by nonparametric estimation method. Besides, in the nonparametric estimation process, the iterative estimation algorithm is introduced to deal with the problem where conditional standard deviation is unpredictable. And the estimation credence of conditional variance function is improved by continually modifying the estimation value of conditional standard deviation as input variance. On the research of day-ahead time series fluctuation characteristics of power price in California in 2000, the time series of Humb node is modeled and forecasted. And the test results show that the model proposed in this paper can better reflect time series volatility clustering characteristics of power price, and it can improve forecasting effect of peak power price by using nonparametric estimation theory. © 2008 DRPT.;"Conditional heteroscedasticity estimation; Conditional standard deviation; Conditional variance model; Electricity market; Iterative method; Nonparametric estimation; NP-GARCH model; Power price forecasting; Time series; Volatility";"Ahead-time; California; Conditional heteroscedasticity estimation; Conditional standard deviation; Conditional variance; Conditional variance model; Electricity market; Estimation theory; Estimation value; GARCH models; Heteroscedasticity; Input variance; International conferences; Iterative estimation; Iterative method; Non-parametric; Non-parametric estimations; Nonparametric estimation; NP-GARCH model; Peak powers; Power price forecasting; Power pricing; Power technologies; Standard deviation; Test results; Time series; Volatility; Volatility clustering; Deregulation; Estimation; Forecasting; Industrial economics; Iterative methods; Modal analysis; Standards; Statistics; Technology; Time series analysis; Electric load forecasting";4;1;1;1

An adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) is proposed in this paper for short-term price forecasting (STPF) in the electricity markets. A commonly used Mexican hat wavelet has been chosen as the activation function for hidden-layer neurons of feed-forward neural network (FFNN). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, day-ahead prediction of market clearing price (MCP) of Spain market, which is a duopoly market with a dominant player, and locational marginal price (LMP) forecasting in PJM electricity market, are considered.

This will complicate short-term load forecasting and challenge the existing forecasting methods that are applied to a fixed-price environment. In regard to the influence of real-time electricity prices on short-term load, a model to forecast short-term load is established by combining the radial basis function (RBF) neural network with the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The model first makes use of the nonlinear approaching capacity of the RBF network to forecast the load on the prediction day with no account of the factor of electricity price, and then, based on the recent changes of the real-time price, it uses the ANFIS system to adjust the results of load forecasting obtained by RBF network. This system integration will improve forecasting accuracy and overcome the defects of the RBF network. As shown in this paper by the results of an example of factual forecasting, the model presented can work effectively. © 2008 IEEE.;"Adaptive neural fuzzy inference system; Power system; Radial basis function neural network; Real-time price; Short-term load forecasting";"Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Image classification; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Adaptive neural fuzzy inference system; Electric energies; Electricity markets; Electricity pricing; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting methods; Load forecasting; Power system; Radial basis function neural network; Radial basis function neural networks; RBF networks; RBF neural network; Real-time price; Short-term load forecasting; System integration; Electric load forecasting";5;1;1;1
Vahidinasab V., Jadid S., Kazemi A.;Day-ahead price forecasting in restructured power systems using artificial neural networks;2008;Electric Power Systems Research;97;Over the past 15 years most electricity supply companies around the world have been restructured from monopoly utilities to deregulated competitive electricity markets. Market participants in the restructured electricity markets find short-term electricity price forecasting (STPF) crucial in formulating their risk management strategies. They need to know future electricity prices as their profitability depends on them. This research project classifies and compares different techniques of electricity price forecasting in the literature and selects artificial neural networks (ANN) as a suitable method for price forecasting. To perform this task, market knowledge should be used to optimize the selection of input data for an electricity price forecasting tool. Then sensitivity analysis is used in this research to aid in the selection of the optimum inputs of the ANN and fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm is used for daily load pattern clustering. Finally, ANN with a modified Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning algorithm are implemented for forecasting prices in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market. The forecasting results were compared with the previous works and showed that the results are reasonable and accurate. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Theodorou P., Karyampas D.;Modeling the return and volatility of the Greek electricity marginal system price;2008;Energy Policy;10;Traditional cost based optimization models (WASP) for expansion planning do not allow for mark-to-market valuation and cannot satisfy arbitrage free requirements. This work will fill this gap by developing and estimating models for mark-to-market valuation. Furthermore the present paper examines the return and volatility of the newly born Greek's electricity market's marginal system price. A detailed description of the market mechanism and regulation is used to describe how prices are determined in order to proceed with return and volatility modeling. Continuous time mean reverting and time varying mean reverting stochastic processes have been solved in discrete time processes and estimated econometrically along with ARMAX and GARCH models. It was found that GARCH model gave much better estimation and forecasting ability. Strong persistence in mean has been found giving suspicions of market inefficiency and strong incentives for arbitrage opportunities. Finally, the change in the regulatory framework has been controlled and found to have significant impact. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Olsson M., Söder L.;Modeling real-time balancing power market prices using combined SARIMA and Markov processes;2008;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;69;This paper describes modeling of real-time balancing power market prices by using combined seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and discrete Markov processes. The combination of such processes allows generation of price series with periods where no demand for balancing power exists. The purpose of the model is simulation of prices to construct scenario trees representing possible realization of the stochastic prices. Such scenario trees can be used in planning models based on stochastic optimization to generate bid sequences to the balancing market. The spread of the prices in the tree and the shape of the scenarios are of central importance. Model parameter estimation methods reflecting the demands on scenario trees have therefore been used. The proposed model is also applied to data from the Nordic power market. The conclusion of this paper is that the developed model is appropriate for modeling real-time balancing power prices. © 2008 IEEE.;"Markov processes; Power prices; SARIMA processes; Scenario generation; Time series analysis";"Marketing; Markov processes; Operating costs; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Trees (mathematics); Power prices; Scenario generation; Seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average; Electric power systems";3, 4;1;3;1

Arciniegas A.I., Arciniegas Rueda I.E.;Forecasting short-term power prices in the Ontario Electricity Market (OEM) with a fuzzy logic based inference system;2008;Utilities Policy;36;The Ontario Electricity Market (OEM), which opened in May 2002, is relatively new and is still under change. In addition, the bidding strategies of the participants are such that the relationships between price and fundamentals are non-linear and dynamic. The lack of market maturity and high complexity hinders the use of traditional statistical methodologies (e.g., regression analysis) for price forecasting. Therefore, a flexible model is needed to achieve good forecasting in OEM. This paper uses a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system in forecasting the one-day-ahead real-time peak price of the OEM. The forecasting results of TSK are compared with those obtained by traditional statistical and neural network based forecasting. The comparison suggests that TSK has considerable value in forecasting one-day-ahead peak price in OEM. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Pino R., Parreno J., Gomez A., Priore P.;Forecasting next-day price of electricity in the Spanish energy market using artificial neural networks;2008;Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence;92;In this paper, next-day hourly forecasts are calculated for the energy price in the electricity production market of Spain. The methodology used to achieve these forecasts is based on artificial neural networks, which have been used successfully in recent years in many forecasting applications. The days to be forecast include working days as well as weekends and holidays, due to the fact that energy price has different behaviours depending on the kind of day to be forecast. Besides, energy price time series are usually composed of too many data, which could be a problem if we are looking for a short period of time to reach an adequate forecast. In this paper, a training method for artificial neural nets is proposed, which is based on making a previous selection for the multilayer perceptron (MLP) training samples, using an ART-type neural network. The MLP is then trained and finally used to calculate forecasts. These forecasts are compared to those obtained from the well-known Box-Jenkins ARIMA forecasting method. Results show that neural nets perform better than ARIMA models, especially for weekends and holidays. Both methodologies calculate more accurate forecasts-in terms of mean absolute percentage error-for working days that for weekends and holidays. Agents involved in the electricity production market, who may need fast forecasts for the price of electricity, would benefit from the results of this study. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The goals of the model was that the model is able to: a) understand the underlying market dynamics by decomposing the price time series into a reasonable set of contributing factors, such as electricity demand in the area, temperature and the market buying and selling bid volumes, and b) forecast prices with reasonable accuracy, based on those insights. To capture the time-variability of the contributing factors to price, self-AR(autoregressive) process was introduced to allow continuous change in the magnitude of influence from each explanatory variable. To estimate this time-varying model, Kalman Filter algorithm was applied for the step-wise, recursive estimation. After optimizing the model under the maximum likelihood method (MLM) and the minimum AIC (Akaike Information Criteria) conditions, the model was able to decompose the 15:00-15:30 JEPX spot electricity strip price into a couple of the most contributing factors, namely the area electricity demand and the gross buying bid volume, both of which showing significant time-dependency. The result also showed that in the first one and a half years of the JEPX operation since its launch in April 2005, the 15:00-15:30 spot prices were mainly driven by the buying bid volume, increasing its volatility around winter in 2005, one of the coldest and the severest winters in the last 30 years. The advantage of this model over conventional Least Square (LS) models is that this time-variability can not be captured with LS models with the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimation, that bases its assumption that all variables are homoskedastic (constant over time). As for the forecasting, our model yielded as good a forecasting accuracy as conventional AR econometric model estimated with the ordinary least square method(OLS), with a squared error of about 1.25 [yen/kWh2] per forecasting period across 11 future data points in September 2006.;"Day-ahead spot market; Japan Electric Power Exchange(JEPX); Kalman Filter algorithm; Price forecasting; Time-series decomposition";"Akaike information criterion; Asset Management strategy; Electric power; Kalman filter algorithms; Maximum likelihood methods; Ordinary least square methods; Price forecasting; Spot market; Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Digital storage; Electricity; Estimation; Forecasting; Kalman filters; Optimization; State space methods; Time series; Mathematical models";4;2;1;1
Zhou Y., Kato M.;Spot prices modeling for JEPX and its applications;2007;CIGRE Symposium Osaka 2007: System Development and Asset Management under Restructuring;0;All analyses of energy management start with spot prices modeling. Modeling spot prices is becoming a challenging issue under the recent power market deregulation. Generally, there are two approaches for analyzing spot prices. One is cost-based analysis, which focuses on the behavior of time-of-day marginal cost of individual generation companies and power demand. Another is market-based analysis, which mainly studies the causes of price fluctuations and the correlation of prices. This analysis usually uses stochastic approach. However, both of these approaches have weaknesses. For instance, cost-based models are typically not concerned with market data, while market-based approaches are usually not concerned with detailed generation stack production cost. In the present state of affairs, 9 electric utilities in Japan have upper hand power as a seller side in JEPX transaction substantially. Therefore, the compound generation marginal costs, especially the compound time-of-day marginal costs of 9 electric utilities, become major factors in the spot pricing mechanism in JEPX. Based on these facts, the fluctuation mechanism of electricity spot prices in JEPX depends on the supply side to a large extent. So modeling spot prices of JEPX, which consider power demand and supply structures, especially with a focus on the compound marginal generation costs in the 9 electric utilities, will work better than solely using the market model such as stochastic models, or only using the cost-based model such as traditional electric load dispatching (ELD) stack cost calculation. This paper addresses the challenge of building spot prices modeling for JEPX in the following ways: First, we propose a modified hybrid model, which can take not only cost-based issue but also market-based issue into consideration, and, at the same time, decompose the marginal cost function into an expected value division and an indeterminate division. Next, in order to represent the relationship with marginal cost and load, we apply a HILL function, which can well fit the feature of 9 utilities' compound marginal cost, and also propose a method to estimate corresponding parameters. Finally, in order to verify the model, we forecast the spot prices by using this model and compare the result with the actual JEPX data. Forecast errors are relatively small (RMS = 4.6%), which shows that the model fits well the spot pricing mechanism. The results show that the model proposed in this paper can redeem some weaknesses of the cost-based model and the market-based model, and fit the spot pricing mechanism more comprehensively. Our model will be useful in ask/bid-strategies and risk management in power trading.;"Electricity market; HILL function; Hybrid model; Marginal cost; Spot price";"Electricity market; Hill function; Hybrid model; Marginal costs; Spot price; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric utilities; Energy management; Risk management; Cost benefit analysis";4;0;1;0
Haghi H.V., Tafreshi S.M.M.;An overview and verification of electricity price forecasting models;2007;8th International Power Engineering Conference, IPEC 2007;12;Many methods and models have been developed to forecast the energy prices in the market environment since the restructuring of the electricity power industry. This paper presents a brief overview of different techniques and models in the literature of energy price forecasting. Then it compares and classifies different models and methods to verify whether these are suitable for different purposes of forecasting or not. Classification is based on the type of the models, suitability with respect to power market, time horizon, level of accuracy and forecasting aim. Based on this approach, a complementary classification of price forecasting models is proposed, which can be used for choosing the suitable method for certain cases. Also, the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM), as an interesting method, is proposed in detail with a modeling and simulation by using the Spanish electricity market data. © 2007 RPS.;"Energy price forecasting; Hidden Markov Models; Price models verification; Time series";"Classification (of information); Costs; Electricity; Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Energy price forecasting; Energy pricing; Power engineering; Price models verification; Time series; Electric load forecasting";3;0;1;0

The work presented in this paper is an extended version of our previous works where we proposed the price prediction technique by using ANN, which is based on similar days method. According to similar days method, we select similar price days corresponding to forecast day based on Euclidean norm. The focus of the present paper is mainly on sensitivity analysis of similar days parameter while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the PJM electricity market. We simulated three cases by: (i) selecting two similar days parameters (load at t and price at t); (ii) selecting three similar days parameters (load at t, price at t and price at t - 1), and (iii) selecting five similar days parameters (load at t, load at t - 1, load at t + 1, price at t and price at t - 1). The next-24h price forecasts obtained from ANN based on similar days method confirm that the performance of the ANN model is better when five similar days parameters are selected, i.e., the accuracy of the method is enhanced by the addition of load at t - 1 and t + 1. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, and historical price factors are well discussed. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of reasonably small values were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination of (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. © 2007 IEEE.";"Artificial neural network; Electricity price forecasting; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Power market; Similar days";"Backpropagation; Correlation methods; Error analysis; Forecasting; Neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; ANN modeling; Artificial neural network; Correlation co-efficient; Electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity pricing; Euclidean norms; Load factors; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Mean absolute percentage error; Mean-square errors; Power market; Price factors; Price forecasting; Price prediction; Similar days; Time factors; Electric load forecasting";4;1;1;1

It plays an important role in power system planning and operation, risk assessment and other decision making. This paper provides a method for predicting hourly prices in the day-ahead electricity market using Recursive Neural Network (RNN) technique, which is based on similar days approach. RNN is a multi-step approach based on one output node, which uses the previous prediction as input for the subsequent forecasts. In this way, it is carried out recursively for twenty four steps to predict next 24 hour prices. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed RNN model with similar days along with other literature is presented. The proposed method is examined on the PJM electricity market.

The most of the predicting techniques are designed for normal price predictions other than price spikes predictions. The aim of this paper is to analyse electricity market data including demand, price, and capacity reserve, to find out their causes to the occurrence of price spikes. The challenge of spike prediction is the accuracy of the prediction that is on how a classifier can capture all spikes that would happen. Particularly precision/recall is used in the evaluation of the spike prediction. It has shown that ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) algorithm has a superior performance in prediction of price spikes compared with other existing classification algorithms such as SVM (Support Vector Machine).

Li C., Zhang M.;Application of GARCH model in the forecasting of day-ahead electricity prices;2007;Proceedings - Third International Conference on Natural Computation, ICNC 2007;8;In the new deregulated electric power industry, price forecasting is becoming increasingly important for the producers and consumers to estimate and maximize their profits. A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) methodology is presented to predict day-ahead electricity prices. For the high volatility of the electricity prices, the GARCH model is more suitable for illustrating the time series data than other forecast model adopted generally. The prediction error is assumed to be serially correlated other than independent variable with zero mean and constant variance, which can be modeled by an Auto Regressive process. Based on the initial values of the parameters of the model gained by Eviews software, Genetic arithmetic is used to optimize them to improve its performance. A detailed explanation of GARCH models is presented and empirical results from the California deregulated electricity-markets are discussed. © 2007 IEEE.;;"Computer simulation; Electricity; Mathematical models; Optimization; Eviews software; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH); Independent variable; Price forecasting; Electric power systems";4;1;1;1

Bierbrauer M., Menn C., Rachev S.T., Trück S.;Spot and derivative pricing in the EEX power market;2007;Journal of Banking and Finance;93;Using spot and futures price data from the German EEX Power market, we test the adequacy of various one-factor and two-factor models for electricity spot prices. The models are compared along two different dimensions: (1) We assess their ability to explain the major data characteristics and (2) the forecasting accuracy for expected future spot prices is analyzed. We find that the regime-switching models clearly outperform its competitors in almost all respects. The best results are obtained using a two-regime model with a Gaussian distribution in the spike regime. Furthermore, for short and medium-term periods our results underpin the frequently stated hypothesis that electricity futures quotes are consistently greater than the expected future spot, a situation which is denoted as contango. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Georgilakis P.S.;Artificial intelligence solution to electricity price forecasting problem;2007;Applied Artificial Intelligence;13;The market-clearing prices in deregulated electricity markets are volatile. Good market-clearing price forecasting will help producers and consumers to prepare their corresponding bidding strategies so as to maximize their profits. Market-clearing price prediction is a difficult task since bidding strategies used by market participants are complicated and various uncertainties interact in an intricate way. This article proposes the use of two artificial neural networks: the first to predict the day-ahead load and the second to forecast the day-ahead market-clearing prices. The methodology is applied to the California power market. After determining the optimal artificial neural network architecture with the minimum mean absolute percentage error on the test set, this architecture is used for price forecasting in periods with price spikes, for price forecasting for weekends, and for week-ahead MCP forecasting during the four seasons of the year. The forecasting accuracy of the artificial neural network model is compared with the accuracy of the persistence method and the results prove the efficiency and practicality of the proposed technique.;;"Costs; Electric utilities; Error analysis; Industrial economics; Mathematical models; Uncertainty analysis; Bidding strategies; Electricity prices; Neural networks";5;1;1;1

Koopman S.J., Ooms M., Carnero M.A.;Periodic seasonal reg-ARFIMA-GARCH models for daily electricity spot prices;2007;Journal of the American Statistical Association;149;Novel periodic extensions of dynamic long-memory regression models with autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic errors are considered for the analysis of daily electricity spot prices. The parameters of the model with mean and variance specifications are estimated simultaneously by the method of approximate maximum likelihood. The methods are implemented for time series of 1,200-4,400 daily price observations in four European power markets. Apart from persistence, heteroscedasticity, and extreme observations in prices, a novel empirical finding is the importance of day-of-the-week periodicity in the autocovariance function of electricity spot prices. In particular, the very persistent daily log prices from the Nord Pool power exchange of Norway are effectively modeled by our framework, which is also extended with explanatory variables to capture supply-and-demand effects. The daily log prices of the other three electricity markets - EEX in Germany, Powernext in France, and APX in The Netherlands - are less persistent, but periodicity is also highly significant. The dynamic behavior differs from market to market and depends primarily on the method of power generation: hydro power, power generated from fossil fuels, or nuclear power. The article improves on existing models in capturing the memory characteristics, which are important in derivative pricing and real option analysis. © 2007 American Statistical Association.;"Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model; Generalized autoregressive conditional heleroscedasticity model; Holiday effects; Long-memory process; Periodic autoregressive model; Volatility";;4;0;1;0

Various forecasting techniques are applied to different time horizons for electricity price forecasting in locational marginal pricing (LMP) spot markets. Available correlated data also have to be selected to improve the short-term forecasting performance.

Karsaz A., Khaloozadeh H.;Medium term horizon market clearing price and load forecasting with an improved dual unscented Kalman filter;2007;2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation, ICCA;3;The deregulation of electric power supply industries has raised many challenging problems. One of the most important ones is forecasting the Market Clearing Price (MCP) of electricity. Decisions on various issues, such as to buy or sell electricity and to offer a transaction to the market, require accurate knowledge of the MCP. Another problem, which has also been an important issue of the traditional power systems, is load forecasting for both short and long terms. The extended kalman filter has been widely adopted for state estimation of nonlinear systems, machine learning applications and neural network training. In the EKF, the state distribution is approximated by the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. Therefore this can introduce large errors in the load and price forecasting as two Chaotic, nonstationary and nonlinear time-series. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF), in contrast, achieves third-order accuracy, by using a minimal set of MCP and load sigma points. In this paper an improved dual unscented Kalman filter (DUKF), which estimate state and parameter simultaneously has been applied to the real New England power market. The numerical stability and more accurate predictions of our method is comparable to the EKF, and traditional neural network training methods. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the DUKF is the same order as that of the EKE. The obtained results show significant improvement in both price and load forecasting. © 2007 IEEE.;"Artificial neural network; Deregulation; Electric power market; Load forecasting; Price prediction; Unscented filtering";"Cost accounting; Deregulation; Electric power distribution; Marketing; Electric power market; Load forecasting; Price prediction; Neural networks";5;2;1;1

Virtually all of these methods are based on using statistical patterns, which are perceived between the yearly load and system marginal price (SMP) histories of the system to predict the forecasted year's power demand and SMP. The SMP forecasting is a very important element in an electricity market for the optimal biddings of market participants as well as for market stabilization of regulatory bodies. The proposed method introduces a system type neural network architecture to perform electricity price forecasting. Specifically, the proposed approach begins with the premise that the electricity price for a given year can be given a structure which can then be related to the structure of the reference year, in such a way that a transformation can be found from the reference year's structure to the forecasting year's structure. The transformation depends upon how parameters, which influenced the SMP but can not be measured, move from the reference year to the forecasting year. © 2006 IEEE.;;"Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Market participants; Optimal bidding; Power demands; Regulatory bodies; Statistical pattern; System marginal price; Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Forecasting; Network architecture; Neural networks; Power transmission; Electric load forecasting";5;1;1;1

Teoh C.C., Sheblè G.B.;Applying spot rate forecast technique in estimating energy price uncertainties;2006;2006 9th International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems, PMAPS;3;"This paper presents a new version of methodology based on Spot Rate Forecasts technique under Market Expectations Theory (Term Structure), for estimating the uncertainty unit price of energy during the unavailability of energy and compares it to the original discrete price probability methodology presented by the paper entitled: Determining Rational Redundancy of 500-kV Reactors in Transmission System Using a Probability-Based Economic Analysis Approach - BCTC's Practice. The basis of Spot Rate Forecasts method is to assume that the market expectations implied by the current spot rate curve will be fulfilled, and heuristic representativeness characteristics are followed; this method has the capability to predict the following cycle of energy price under uncertainties (similar method in logically predicting future spot rate curve). The methodology of determining a rational redundancy level of power system equipment based on coordination among the total transfer capability (TTC) in the transmission system and the estimation of random equipment failures remain the same. The Spot Rate Forecasts methodology is only applied to the electric energy market information, where the price of energy is involved. The result indicates that Spot Rate Forecast Methodology is another technique of estimating the uncertainty of energy price besides the discrete probability technique. © Copyright KTH 2006.";"Market expectations theory; Power system reliability; Probability; Reactors; Redundancy; Spot rate forecasting technique; Term structure; Unavailability; Uncertainty";"Curves (road); Economic analysis; Electric load forecasting; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Estimation; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Heuristic methods; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power transmission; Probability; Quality assurance; Random processes; Redundancy; Reliability; Risk assessment; Statistics; Transmissions; (e ,2e) theory; Analysis approach; Applied (CO); Electric energy markets; Energy pricing; Equipment failures; international conferences; Market expectations; Power system equipments; power systems; Probabilistic methods; Term structure; Total transfer capability (TTC); Transmission systems; Unit prices; Uncertainty analysis";−1;−1;−1;−1
Mori H., Awata A.;A hybrid method of clipping and artificial neural network for electricity price zone forecasting;2006;2006 9th International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems, PMAPS;7;This paper proposes a new method for electricity price zone forecasting. The proposed method makes use of the clipping technique that is one of data mining techniques for simplifying the relationship between input and output variables. It expresses an output variable in binary number. Electricity price forecasting is difficult to handle due to the nonlinearity of time series. This paper predicts the one-step-ahead price zone. In this paper, the normalized radial basis function network is used as an artificial neural network (ANN) to evaluate the predicted price. The proposed method is tested for the electricity price in the New England power market. ©Copyright KTH 2006.;"Data mining; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; MLP; Neural network applications; Prediction method; Time series";"Administrative data processing; Backpropagation; Data mining; Decision support systems; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Image classification; Information management; Knowledge management; Neural networks; Power transmission; Probability; Radial basis function networks; Search engines; Statistics; Time series analysis; Applied (CO); Artificial neural network (ANNs); binary numbers; Data mining techniques; electricity price forecasting; electricity price zone forecasting; electricity pricing; hybrid methods; Input and output (I/O); international conferences; New England; New methods; Nonlinearity (including bifurcation theory); Normalized radial basis function (NRBF); Power markets; power systems; Price zone; Probabilistic methods; Time Series; Electric load forecasting";5;1;1;1
Benaouda D., Murtagh F.;Hybrid wavelet model for electricity pool-price forecasting in a deregulated electricity market;2006;IEEE International Conference on Engineering of Intelligent Systems, ICEIS 2006;6;Electricity supply industry is in the process of deregulation in many countries including Australia. The purpose of deregulation is to give consumers free choices of their electricity supply. Thus, accurate electricity pool price forecasting can provide a set of vital predicted information that helps generation, transmission and retailer participating companies to bid strategically into a deregulated electricity market in order to maximize their profits. In this article, we propose a wavelet multiscale decomposition based autoregressive approach for the prediction of one-hour ahead and one-day ahead pool price based on historical electricity pool price and predicted electricity load data. This approach is based on a multiple resolution decomposition of the signal using the non-decimated or redundant Haar à trous wavelet transform whose advantage is taking into account the asymmetric nature of the time-varying data. There is an additional computational advantage in that there is no need to re-compute the wavelet transform (wavelet coefficients) of the full signal if the electricity pool price data (time series) is regularly updated. We assess results produced by this multiscale autoregressive (MAR) method, in both linear and non-linear variants, with single resolution autoregressive (AR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. Experimental results are based on the New South Wales (Australia) electricity load and pool price data that is provided by the National Electricity Market Management Company (NEMMCO). © 2006 IEEE.;"Autoregression; Multi-layer perceptron; Resolution scale; Time-series; Wavelet transform";"Energy policy; Marketing; Multilayer neural networks; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Wavelet transforms; Autoregression; Electricity markets; Hybrid wavelet models; Resolution scales; Electric load forecasting";4, 5;1;1;1
Ranjbar M., Soleymani S., Sadati N., Ranjbar A.M.;Electricity price forecasting using artificial neural network;2006;2006 International Conference on Power Electronics, Drives and Energy Systems, PEDES '06;19;In the restructured power markets, price of electricity has been the key of all activities in the power market. Accurately and efficiently forecasting electricity price becomes more and more important. Therefore in this paper, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is designed for short term price forecasting of electricity in the environment of restructured power market. The proposed ANN model is a four-layered perceptron neural network, which consists of, input layer, two hidden layers and output layer. Instead of conventional back propagation (BP) method, Levenberg- Marquardt BP (LMBP) method has been used for the ANN training to increase the speed of convergence.

Lin Z., Gao L., Zhang D.;Predictions of system marginal price of electricity using recurrent neural network;2006;Proceedings of the World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation (WCICA);2;The accuracy of system marginal price (SMP) is important for bidding of generation companies. Based on analyzing characteristic of SMP, electrical load, historical value of SMP corresponding time and tendency of current SMP are regarded as three main influencing factors in estimating the next numeric value of SMP. A recurrent neural network is also introduced to forecast the SMP, because it has an ability of mapping dynamic system and SMP is regarded as a result of dynamic power market run. Aiming at the difficulty of determining neural network's structure and weights, the GA optimization algorithm is used to get them by previously combining binary encoding and real encoding. The history data of American California showed this method is effective and the forecast model is accurate. © 2006 IEEE.;"Forecasting; Genetic algorithm; Recurrent neural network; System marginal price";"Binary codes; Dynamical systems; Electric loads; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Recurrent neural networks; Dynamic power markets; Network structure; System marginal price (SMP); Electricity";5;0;1;1

Sun W., Lu J.-C., Meng M.;Application of time series based SVM model on next-day electricity price forecasting under deregulated power market;2006;Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics;24;With the development of power markets, electricity price especially the market clearing price (MCP) forecasting is becoming more and more important in such new competitive markets since the MCP forecasting is the basis of decision making for participants in electricity market. In this paper the problem of modeling market clearing price forecasting in deregulated markets is studied. And electricity price forecasting with support vector machines based on time series is provided. Except considering MCP price influential factors such as previous competitive load, making-up price, competitive generating capacity etc, the past price data which are time series style or not have been included as attributes in input parameters. That is to introduce the concept of time series into our presented model. Based on these influential factors, the corresponding SVM forecasting model is presented. The proposed algorithm is more robust and reliable as compared to traditional approach and neural networks. The performance of our proposed modeling approach has been tested using practical electricity market and compared with traditional neural network. The satisfactory results with better generalization capability and lower prediction error can be obtained. © 2006 IEEE.;"Electricity market; MCP forecasting; SVM; Time series";"Algorithms; Electric power generation; Electricity; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Time series analysis; Competitive generating capacity; Electricity market; Market clearing price (MCP) forecasting; Cost accounting";5;1, 2;1;1
Zareipour H., Cañzares C.A., Bhattacharya K., Thomson J.;Application of public-domain market information to forecast Ontario's wholesale electricity prices;2006;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;111;"This paper evaluates the usefulness of publicly available electricity market information in forecasting the hourly Ontario energy price (HOEP). In order to do so, relevant data from Ontario and its neighboring electricity markets, namely, New York, New England, and PJM electricity markets, are investigated, and a final set of explanatory variable candidates that are available before real-time are selected. Multivariate transfer function and dynamic regression models are employed to relate HOEP behavior to the selected explanatory variable candidates. Univariate ARIMA models are also developed for the HOEP. The HOEP models are developed on the basis of two forecasting horizons, i.e., 3 h and 24 h, and forecasting performance of the multivariate models is compared with that of the univariate models. The outcomes show that the market information publicly available before real-time can be used to improve HOEP forecast accuracy to some extent; however, unusually high or low prices remain unpredictable, and hence, the available data cannot lead to significantly more accurate forecasts. Nevertheless, the generated forecasts in this paper are significantly more accurate than currently available HOEP forecasts. To analyze the relatively low accuracy of the HOEP forecasts, comparisons are made with respect to ARIMA models developed for locational marginal prices (LMPs) of Ontario's three neighboring markets, and price volatility analyses are presented. © 2006 IEEE.";"Electricity markets; Price forecasting; Time series models; Volatility analysis";"Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Marketing; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Transfer functions; Electricity markets; Price forecasting; Volatility analysis; Electric power systems";4;1;1;1
Mandal P., Senjyu T., Funabashi T.;Neural networks approach to forecast several hour ahead electricity prices and loads in deregulated market;2006;Energy Conversion and Management;133;In daily power markets, forecasting electricity prices and loads are the most essential task and the basis for any decision making. An approach to predict the market behaviors is to use the historical prices, loads and other required information to forecast the future prices and loads. This paper introduces an approach for several hour ahead (1-6 h) electricity price and load forecasting using an artificial intelligence method, such as a neural network model, which uses publicly available data from the NEMMCO web site to forecast electricity prices and loads for the Victorian electricity market. An approach of selection of similar days is proposed according to which the load and price curves are forecasted by using the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. A Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of the similar days. Two different ANN models, one for one to six hour ahead load forecasting and another for one to six hour ahead price forecasting have been proposed. The MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) results show a clear increasing trend with the increase in hour ahead load and price forecasting. The sample average of MAPEs for one hour ahead price forecasts is 9.75%. This figure increases to only 20.03% for six hour ahead predictions. Similarly, the one to six hour ahead load forecast errors (MAPE) range from 0.56% to 1.30% only. MAPE results show that several hour ahead electricity prices and loads in the deregulated Victorian market can be forecasted with reasonable accuracy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Gareta R., Romeo L.M., Gil A.;Forecasting of electricity prices with neural networks;2006;Energy Conversion and Management;118;During recent years, the electricity energy market deregulation has led to a new free competition situation in Europe and other countries worldwide. Generators, distributors and qualified clients have some uncertainties about the future evolution of electricity markets. In consequence, feasibility studies of new generation plants, design of new systems and energy management optimization are frequently postponed. The ability of forecasting energy prices, for instance the electricity prices, would be highly appreciated in order to improve the profitability of utility investments. The development of new simulation techniques, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), has provided a good tool to forecast time series. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the Neural Network (NN) approach can be used to forecast short term hourly electricity pool prices (for the next day and two or three days after). The NN architecture and design for prices forecasting are described in this paper. The results are tested with extensive data sets, and good agreement is found between actual data and NN results. This methodology could help to improve power plant generation capacity management and, certainly, more profitable operation in daily energy pools. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Zhou M., Yan Z., Ni Y.X., Li G., Nie Y.;Electricity price forecasting with confidence-interval estimation through an extended ARIMA approach;2006;IEE Proceedings: Generation, Transmission and Distribution;74;Accurate electricity price forecasting is a crucial issue concerned by market participants either for developing bidding strategies or for making investment decisions. Due to the complicated factors affecting electricity prices, accurate price forecasting turns out to be very difficult. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach has been extended to make hourly market clearing price (MCP) forecasting in electricity spot markets with error correction and confidence interval estimation. The ARIMA model used for forecasting price and the method to implement price forecasting are presented first. Then the ARIMA approach is extended to include error correction for improving accuracy of price forecasting. Moreover, the confidence interval of the forecasted prices is estimated assuming the residual errors are in gaussian or uniform distribution. Hourly MCP forecasting of the Californian Power Market is used as a computer example, and the comparison with conventional ARIMA approach is given. Computer test results show clearly that the suggested extended ARIMA approach for spot price forecasting is very effective with satisfactory accuracy. It can work under very worse market conditions with high price volatility.;;"Decision making; Electricity; Error correction; Estimation; Investments; '; Bidding strategies; Electricity prices; Market clearing price (MCP); Electric load forecasting";4;1;1;1, 2

Many electric power markets are operated in many deregulated areas. We have already investigated the electric power prices of the day-ahead markets by the regression equations, such as California, PJM, NEMMCO, and so on. The simple regression equations are composed in our analysis, of which the dependent variable is the power price and the explanatory variables are the power demand and the power price of 24 hours ago. To improve the decision factor of the regression equations, we use the meteorological parameter as the new explanatory variables. The new regression equations are applied to the price data of New England market. Furthermore, because the decision factors are not good especially in the winter seasons, we introduce a ""cold temperature"" as the new explanatory variables.

First the chaotic feature of electricity price is verified with the chaos theory. The Lyapunov exponents and the fractal dimensions of the attractors are extracted. Here it can be seen that the electricity price possesses chaotic characteristics, providing the basis for performing the short-term forecast of electricity price with the help of the chaos theory. Then an accurate phase space is reconstructed by multivariable time series constituted by electricity price and its correlated factors, i.e., the system load and the available generating capacity time series. By tracing the evolving trend of the adjacent phase points in the phase space, the global and local electricity price forecasting models based on the recurrent neural network are established, with which the electricity prices in the New England electricity market are successfully predicted.;"Chaos; Electricity price; Forecast; Power market";"Chaos theory; Lyapunov functions; Recurrent neural networks; Electricity price; Power market; Electric rates";0;1;1;1
Qiaolin D., Jing T., Jianxin L.;Application of new FCMAC neural network in power system marginal price forecasting;2005;7th International Power Engineering Conference, IPEC2005;6;In the electric power market, power system marginal price forecasting is the basis for power companies to build their optimal bidding strategies. Price forecasting is a new research area, because power market is still in the rudimentary stage in China. Due to its attractive properties of learning convergence and speed, many practical areas have widely put it into use including power system marginal price forecasting area. The method of neural network is good at its learning capability but lack of clear internal knowledge expression. The beginning of study is limited to random initial conditions, which may lead to low convergence speed and even local extremum. Necessary initial experience and knowledge cannot be fully made use of. While fuzzy logic method is good at approximate and qualitative knowledge expression but lack of learning capability. Membership function and fuzzy rules can only be selected by experience and tries. Besides, the study and adjustment of parameters and weigh is rather difficult. Thus, the proper combination of the above methods is a breakthrough in effective system control. This paper establishes a short-term forecasting model of power system marginal price using the method of Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller Neural Network, and applies it to power market in real province for training and examining. FCMAC method is proved to be superior to former methods, for its low need of training samples, its stable outputs, its high forecasted speed and accuracy.

Karsaz A., Mashhadi H.R., Eshraghnia R.;Cooperative co-evolutionary approach to electricity load and price forecasting in deregulated electricity markets;2005;2006 IEEE Power India Conference;9;Many electric power systems around the world have introduced deregulated markets where suppliers of electricity can freely compete. Deregulation of the electric power industry worldwide raises many challenging issues. Under this environment there will be new tasks to be solved. In the traditional and also new structure of the power industry, accurate short and long term load forecasting have been crucial to the efficient and economic operation of the system. However in the environment of a deregulated power market, various decisions require accurate knowledge of future spot prices for electricity. To buy or sell physical electricity, to offer a transaction to the market, or to analyze security of the network are examples of transactions that can rationally be made only with an idea of future electricity prices. Therefore, forecasting of the Market Clearing Price (MCP) is becoming increasingly relevant to different market players and system operator. This paper introduces a new forecasting method that forecasts the next-day electricity price and the electricity load based on Cooperative Co-evolutionary (Co-Co) approach. The proposed method is applied to predict the MCP and the load in a real power market. The results of the new method show significant improvement in the load and price forecasting process. © 2006 IEEE.;"Artificial neural networks; Cooperative co-evolutionary; Deregulation; Electric power markets; Load forecasting; Price forecasting";"Decision making; Electric industry; Electric loads; Forecasting; Marketing; Neural networks; Electric power markets; Load forecasting; Market Clearing Price (MCP); Price forecasting; Industrial economics";5;1;1;1

The historical and usually ill-behaved price series is decomposed using the wavelet transform in a set of better-behaved constitutive series. Then, the future values of these constitutive series are forecast using properly fitted ARIMA models. In turn, the ARIMA forecasts allow, through the inverse wavelet transform, reconstructing the future behavior of the price series and therefore to forecast prices.

Zhang L., Luh P.B.;Neural network-based market clearing price prediction and confidence interval estimation with an improved extended Kalman filter method;2005;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;152;Market clearing prices (MCPs) play an important role in a deregulated power market, and good MCP prediction and confidence interval (CD estimation will help utilities and independent power producers submit effective bids with low risks. MCP prediction, however, is difficult, since MCP is a nonstationary process. Effective prediction, in principle, can be achieved by neural networks using extended Kalman filter (EKF) as an integrated adaptive learning and CI estimation method. EKF learning, however, is computationally expensive because it involves high dimensional matrix manipulations. This paper presents a modified U-D factorization method within the decoupled EKF (DEKF) framework. The computational speed and numerical stability of this resulting DEKF-UD method are significantly improved as compared to standard EKF. Testing results for a classroom problem and New England MCP predictions show that this new method provides smaller CIs than what provided by the BP-Bayesian method developed by the authors. Testing also shows that our new method has faster convergence, provides more accurate predictions as compared to BP-Bayesian, and our DEKF-UD MCP predictions are comparable in quality to ISO New England's predictions. © 2005 IEEE.;"Confidence interval; Deregulated power market; Extended Kalman filter; Market clearing price; Neural networks; Prediction";"Costs; Deregulation; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Kalman filtering; Learning algorithms; Marketing; Matrix algebra; Neural networks; Statistical methods; Confidence interval; Deregulated power market; Extended Kalman filter; Market clearing price; Electric power systems";4, 5;1;1;2
Lee J.-K., Park J.-B., Shin J.-R., Lee K.Y.;A system marginal price forecasing method based on an artificial neural network using time and day information;2005;IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC-PapersOnline);1;This paper presents a forecasting technique of the short-term system marginal price (SMP) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The SMP forecasting is a very important element in an electricity market for the optimal biddings of market participants as well as for market stabilization of regulatory bodies. Input data are organized in two different approaches, time-axis and day-axis approaches, and the resulting patterns are used to train the ANN. Performances of the two approaches are compared and the better estimate is selected by a composition rule to forecast the SMP. By combining the two approaches, the proposed composition technique reflects the characteristics of hourly, daily and seasonal variations, as well as the condition of sudden changes in the spot market, and thus improves the accuracy of forecasting. The proposed method is applied to the historical real-world data from the Korea Power Exchange (KPX) to verify the effectiveness of the technique.

Zhang B., Zeng C., Wang S., Xie P.;Forecasting market-clearing price in day-ahead market using SOM-ANN;2004;39th International Universities Power Engineering Conference, UPEC 2004 - Conference Proceedings;8;Forecasting the market-clearing price (MCP) is the most essential task for any decision-making. In this paper, a three-layer back propagation (BP) network model is proposed firstly. Three kinds of factors: the historical loads and MCPs, the behavior of the participants and the reliability level of the power system, are considered as the inputs of the model. Secondly, based on the characteristic of self-organizing and clustering of Self-Organizing Map (SOM), a method is proposed to deal with the sample dataset of the BP model, which can perform a consistency analysis, and then form a new training dataset. Historical loads and prices of 2002 in Queensland of Australian day-ahead energy market are used for training and forecasting test. The results show that our methods are promising, and that by using the BP network on the new dataset analyzed by SOM for the prediction, the precision and the efficiency are advanced remarkably.;;"Historical loads; Market-clearing price; Training datasets; Backpropagation; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Marketing; Reliability; Electric load forecasting";5;1;1;1
Ruiz Monroy J.J., Kita H., Tanaka E., Hasegawa J.;Price forecasting in the day-ahead electricity market;2004;39th International Universities Power Engineering Conference, UPEC 2004 - Conference Proceedings;2;"Electricity markets are becoming more sophisticated and price forecasting is gaining importance for market participants to adjust their bids in the day ahead electricity market. Compared with load, the price of electricity is volatile, but it is not regarded as random; therefore it is possible to identify patterns based on historical data and load forecast. Market participants only have access to the public information provided by the Independent System Operator (ISO); this limits the ability of the market participants to produce accurate price forecast. An accurate estimation of the electricity price helps the market participants to determine their bidding strategy; making necessary the development of accurate price forecasting methods. In this paper the authors propose a statistical method for price forecasting considering the historical price and loads of the California power market; matching the load and price profiles of the forecasting day with historical data of previous similar days. Simulation results show that the forecasted price is closely related with the price historical data and the load of the forecasting day. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by comparing the actual price with the forecasted price and calculating the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The simulation results show the accuracy of the method and its practical application. The proposed method can help market participants to evaluate the risks associated with price volatility and helps them to determine their bidding strategy.";"Electricity markets; Load and price historical data; Mean absolute percentage error (mape); Price forecasting; Statistical method";"Electricity markets; Load and price historical data; Mean absolute percentage error (mape); Price forecasting; Cost benefit analysis; Customer satisfaction; Depreciation; Electric power generation; Electric power utilization; Electric rates; Electricity; Forecasting; Risks; Statistical methods; Electrical engineering";4;0;1;0

First, this paper designs the feature extraction model of SMP influencing factors based on independent component analysis, which is developed by kernel density estimate. Then the feature extraction of SMP influencing factors is realized, which produces the independent features. After the training of regress SVM with the obtained sample set, SMP forecast model is built According to this model, SMP forecast accuracy is enhanced, with the generalization ability of support vector machine and the feature extraction ability of independent component analysis, which not only improves the representation of SMP input samples, but also decreases the maximum of absolute value of relative error. Finally, SMP real-word data of spot market in California is employed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. © 2004 IEEE.;"Feature extraction; Independent component analysis; Support vector machine; System marginal price";"Marginal cost curves; SMP; Support vector machines (SMV); System marginal price; Algorithms; Costs; Electric power systems; Electricity; Feature extraction; Independent component analysis; Linear equations; Marketing; Matrix algebra; Optimization; Personnel training; Regression analysis; Electric industry";5;0;1;1

To be able to modelize such a behavior, we consider the k-factor GIGARCH process. The related parameter estimation problem is addressed using an extension of Whittle's estimation. We develop the corresponding asymptotic theory for estimation. We apply this approach to the electricity prices (spot prices) from the German energy market (European Energy eXchange). For these data, we propose two models of k-factor GIGARCH processes.

The model can be used when creating scenario trees that are used in stochastic programming problems to generate optimal bids to the regulating power market The model considers spot market price correlation and the design of the regulating power market, including the delay time of release of prices and submission time. The usual estimation methods associated with stochastic processes are not sufficient for this application. Therefore, new parameter estimation methods have been developed for the ARIMA process. The model and the estimation methods are used in a case study, where real data from the Nordic power market is used. A conclusion is that ARIMA processes are possible to use for this kind of models.;"Optimization; Power market; Regulating market; Stochastic process; Time series analysis";"Correlation methods; Costs; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Electric power plants; Error correction; Marketing; Mathematical models; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Planning; Polynomials; Random processes; Regulatory compliance; Time series analysis; Dealy time; Power market; Regulating market; Submission time; Electric rates";4;0;1;0
Ma Y., Luh P.B., Kasiviswanathan K., Ni E.;A neural network-based method for forecasting zonal locational marginal prices;2004;2004 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting;23;To direct market participants to make efficient use of both transmission and generation resources, energy for both day-ahead and real-time markets is priced by Locational Marginal Price (LMP). Good LMP forecasting will help market participants make effective decisions when preparing offers and bids and making bilateral contracts. LMP forecasting, however, is difficult since LMPs are closely affected by complicated market behaviors and depend heavily on transmission congestions. This paper presents a neural network-based method for forecasting zonal LMPs by using the Decoupled Extend Kalman Filter (DEKF) with UD factorization and sequential updating. Congestion components are emphasized by forecasting differences between zonal LMPs and hub LMPs, and the hub LMPs themselves are forecasted by their logarithm to better reflect market behaviors. A method is also developed to capture system transmission outages. To overcome the unavailability of zonal loads, a method is developed to predict zonal loads based on the total load. Two neural networks are developed to forecast real-time LMPs before and after the day-ahead market is cleared. Testing results with data from the PJM and New England markets show that the method is computationally efficient and provides accurate LMP predictions and confidence intervals. Testing at New England market shows the method requires a small set of training data.;"Decoupled extended Kalman filter; Locational Marginal Price forecasting; Power system; Sequential processing algorithm";"Algorithms; Computational methods; Decision making; Electric power generation; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission; Electric rates; Forecasting; Kalman filtering; Neural networks; Decoupled extended Kalman filter (DEKF); Locational marginal price (LMP) forecasting; Sequential processing algorithm; Standard market design (SMD); Electric utilities";5;1;1;2
Zhou M., Yan Z., Ni Y., Li G.;An ARIMA approach to forecasting electricity price with accuracy improvement by predicted errors;2004;2004 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting;31;Accurate forecasting electricity price is becoming a crucial issue concerned by market participants either for developing bidding strategies or for making investment decisions. Due to the complicated factors affecting electricity prices, accurate forecasting price turns out to be very difficult and usually cannot be achieved by a single forecasting model. This paper proposes an ARIMA approach to price forecasting with accuracy improvement by predicted errors. Besides a conventional model for price forecasting, models for forecasting residual errors are also established iteratively. ARIMA models for forecasting daily average prices, based on historical data of Californian Power Market, are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Results show that the method only requires easy-implemented low-order models instead of one complex model, while the accuracy of forecasting is improved significantly.

But there is always a dilemma of how to predict spot prices to generation companies (GenCos). This paper is concerned with the prediction of the spot prices in the electricity market using the method of nonlinear auto-correlated chaotic model associating with neural network and wavelet theory. Data information including the weather and day-ahead electric prices are preprocessed through the Fourier wave filter. A new wavelet based on neural network study programming, in which the Sigmoid function in the ANN is substituted by wavelet function, is presented to solve this problem. Through the approach, GenCos can make accurate decisions on scheduling generators and provide high quality power services to customers.

Guo J.-J., Luh P.B.;Improving market clearing price prediction by using a committee machine of neural networks;2004;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;87;"Predicting market clearing prices is an important but difficult task, and neural networks have been widely used. A single neural network, however, may misrepresent part of the input-output data mapping that could have been correctly represented by different networks. The use of a ""committee machine"" composed of multiple networks can in principle alleviate such a difficulty. A major challenge for using a committee machine is to properly combine predictions from multiple networks, since the performance of individual networks is input dependent due to mapping misrepresentation. This paper presents a new method in which weighting coefficients for combining network predictions are the probabilities that individual networks capture the true input-output relationship at that prediction instant. Testing of the New England market cleaning prices demonstrates that the new method performs better than individual networks, and better than committee machines using current ensemble-averaging methods. © 2004 IEEE.";"Committee machines; Energy price forecasting; Multiple model approach; Neural networks";"Forecasting; Marketing; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Probability; Statistical methods; Committee machines; Energy price forecasting; Market clearing prices; Multiple model approach; Electric power systems";5;1;1;1

The model consists: price simulation, price forecasting, and performance analysis. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, reserve factors, and historical price factor are discussed. We adopted ANN and proposed a new definition for the MAPE using the median to study the relationship between these factors and market price as well as the performance of the electricity price forecasting. The reserve factors are included to enhance the performance of the forecasting process.

Zhang L., Luh P.B., Kasiviswanathan K.;Energy clearing price prediction and confidence interval estimation with cascaded neural networks;2003;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;142;The energy market clearing prices (MCPs) in deregulated power markets are volatile. Good MCP prediction and its confidence interval estimation will help utilities and independent power producers submit effective bids with low risks. MCP prediction, however, is difficult since bidding strategies used by participants are complicated and various uncertainties interact in an intricate way. Furthermore, MCP predictors usually have a cascaded structure, as several key input factors need to be predicted first. Cascaded structures are widely used, however, they have not been adequately investigated. This paper analyzes the uncertainties involved in a cascaded neural-network (NN) structure for MCP prediction, and develops the prediction distribution under the Bayesian framework. A computationally efficient algorithm to evaluate the confidence intervals by using the memoryless Quasi-Newton method is also developed. Testing results on a classroom problem and on New England MCP prediction show that the method is computationally efficient and provides accurate prediction and confidence coverage.

In order to validate the chaotic characteristic of electricity price, a phase space is firstly reconstructed from the scalar price time series in this paper. Secondly, the main features of attractors, i.e., the correlation dimensions and Lyapunov exponents are extracted and the surrogate data method is used. The analyzed results indicate that electricity price has chaotic characteristic and its short-term forecast can be realized by employing the chaos theory. Then, in order to achieve accurate short-term forecast, in the phase space reconstructed from multivariate time series, the global and local price forecasting model based on the recurrent neural network is proposed and successfully applied to the forecasting of the energy price on the New England market.;"Chaotic characteristic; Electricity price; Forecasting model; Power market";"Chaos theory; Costs; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Neural networks; Surrogate data; Electricity";5;1;1;1
Guo J.-J., Luh P.B.;Selecting input factors for clusters of Gaussian radial basis function networks to improve market clearing price prediction;2003;IEEE Transactions on Power Systems;68;In a deregulated power market, bidding decisions rely on good market clearing price prediction. One of the common forecasting methods is Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF) networks that approximate input-output relationships by building localized Gaussian functions (clusters). Currently, a cluster uses all the input factors. Certain input factors, however, may not be significant and should be deleted because they mislead local learning and result in poor predictions. Existing pruning methods for neural networks examine the significance of connections between neurons, and are not applicable to deleting center and standard deviation parameters in a GRBF network since those parameters bear no sense of significance of connection. In this paper, the inverses of standard deviations are found to capture a sense of connection, and based on this finding, a new training method to identify and eliminate unimportant input factors is developed. Numerical testing results from two classroom problems and from New England Market Clearing Price prediction show that the new training method leads to significantly improved prediction performance with a smaller number of network parameters.;"Market clearing price forecasting; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks";"Algorithms; Computational complexity; Computer simulation; Error analysis; Forecasting; Independent component analysis; Learning systems; Marketing; Matrix algebra; Monte Carlo methods; Principal component analysis; Radial basis function networks; Clusters; Gaussian radial basis function networks; Market clearing price prediction; Pruning methods; Two step training; Electric rates";5;1;1;1

MCP is a non-stationary process, and an adaptive algorithm with fast convergence is important. A common method for MCP prediction is neural networks, and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) can be used as an integrated adaptive learning and interval estimation method, with fast convergence and small confidence interval. However, the EKF learning is computationally expensive because it involves high dimensional matrices. This paper presents a modified U-D factorization method within the framework of decoupled EKF. The computation speed is significantly improved and also is the numerical stability. EKF learning can then be used for high dimensional practical problems. Testing results show that the integrated learning and confidence interval algorithm provides better prediction than the back propagation algorithm and the confidence interval is smaller than that of a Bayesian inference-based interval estimation method.;"Confidence interval; Extended Kalman filter; Market energy clearing price; Neural networks; Power systems; Prediction";"Adaptive algorithms; Asymptotic stability; Backpropagation; Computational methods; Convergence of numerical methods; Cost accounting; Deregulation; Electric industry; Estimation; Kalman filtering; Confidence Interval Estimation; Extended Kalman filter; Independent power producer; Integrated adaptive learning; Market Clearing Price Prediction; Neural networks";5;1;1;2

The wavelet coefficients associated with certain frequency and time localization are adjusted using the conventional multiple regression method and then reconstructed in order to predict the SMP for the next scheduling day through a five scale synthesis technique. The outcome of the study clearly indicates that the proposed wavelet transform approach can be used as an attractive and effective means for SMP forecasting. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The recurrent neural network (RNN) was addressed and the traditional NN-based on a back-propogation algorithm was also investigated for comparison. The FCM helped classify the load levels into three clusters. Individual RNNs according to three load clusters were developed for forecasting LMPs. These RNNs were trained/validated and tested with historical data from the PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland) power system. It was found that the proposed neural networks were capable of forecasting LMP values efficiently.;;"Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Computer simulation; Electric load forecasting; Fuzzy sets; Neural networks; Locational marginal prices (LMP); Electric industry";5;1;1;1

Li C., Guo Z.;Short-term system marginal price forecasting with hybrid module;2002;PowerCon 2002 - 2002 International Conference on Power System Technology, Proceedings;8;In this paper, dynamic clustering and a BP neural network were combined to forecast short-term system marginal price (SMP). With the criterion of minimal distance between the sample data and the clustering center, sample data were divided into several classes with the dynamic clustering method. Then BP neural network modules with the same topology structure and different weights and thresholds were built for every class. Weights and thresholds of different layers' neurons in the BP neural network were revised in the backpropagation process. This set of forecasting modules were trained and tested on historical marginal price data from the American PJM power system. This kind of module can correctly predict short-term system marginal price. © 2002 IEEE.;"BP Neural Network; Dynamic Clustering; Power Market; System Marginal Price";"Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; BP neural networks; Clustering centers; Different layers; Dynamic clustering; Dynamic clustering methods; Minimal distance; System marginal price; Topology structure; Costs";5;1;1;1

Liu H., Wang X., Zhang W., Xu G.;Market clearing price forecasting based on dynamic fuzzy system;2002;PowerCon 2002 - 2002 International Conference on Power System Technology, Proceedings;9;The problem of forecasting power market clearing price is addressed based on dynamic fuzzy system (DFS). Dynamic fuzzy system is a modified model of fuzzy system. It separates the rule reasoning layer into two layers: antecedent layer and consequence layer. DFS can learn rules by itself from sample data rapidly. As all sample data were input into DFS completely, the rule set of DFS are established automatically. Therefore, DFS performs well in dynamic condition. In addition, hybrid-and-length-varied-encoding genetic algorithms (GAs) is used to train the DFS. New crossover operator and mutation operator for this scheme are presented. The whole model, not only the membership function parameters, but also the fuzzy quantities numbers of input and output variables are adjusted automatically based on sample data. The problem of forecasting market clearing price (MCP) in power market is very important and very complicated. In this paper, DFS is used to solve this problem. With the consideration of California Power Market MCP data, the test results shows that DFS performs very well in this varied condition. © 2002 IEEE.;"Dynamic Fuzzy System; Finding Fuzzy Rule; Genetic Algorithms; Market Clearing Price; Power Market";"Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Membership functions; Power markets; Problem solving; Crossover operator; Dynamic condition; Dynamic fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithm (GAs); Input and outputs; Market Clearing Price; Market clearing prices; Mutation operators; Fuzzy inference";3, 4;1;1;1
Deng S.-J., Jiang W.;An inverse-quantile function approach for modeling electricity price;2002;Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences;2;We propose a class of alternative stochastic volatility models for electricity prices using the quantile function modeling approach. Specifically, we fit marginal distributions of power prices to two special classes of distributions by matching the quantile of an empirical distribution to that of a theoretical distribution. The distributions from the first class have closed form formulas for probability densities, probability distribution functions, and quantile functions, while the distributions from the second class may have extremely unbalanced tails. Having rich tail behaviors, both classes allow realistic modeling of the power price dynamics. The appealing features of this approach are that it can effectively model the heavy tail behavior of electricity prices caused by jumps and stochastic volatility and that the resulting distributions are easy to simulate. This latter feature enables us to perform both parameter estimation and derivative pricing tasks based on price data directly observed from real markets. © 2002 IEEE.;"Electricity supply industry; Energy management; ISO; Mathematical model; Power markets; Power system management; Pricing; Probability distribution; Risk management; Stochastic processes";"Commerce; Costs; Distribution functions; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric utilities; Energy management; Inverse problems; Mathematical models; Power markets; Probability; Random processes; Risk management; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Empirical distributions; ISO; Marginal distribution; Power system management; Probability densities; Quantile functions; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic Volatility Model; Probability distributions";4;2, 3;1;2

Guo J.-J., Luh P.B.;Market clearing price prediction using a committee machine with adaptive weighting coefficients;2002;Proceedings of the IEEE Power Engineering Society Transmission and Distribution Conference;12;The use of a committee machine composed of multiple neural networks can capture more features in data and overcome the inadequacy of a single network. Different neural networks, however, may capture different features in data, and result in different inferences and predictions. Furthermore, network performance may not be constant as input features change. Without information on prediction quality of individual networks, it is difficult to appropriately combine them in a committee machine. To overcome the difficulty, insightful information called the prediction confidence is introduced and an associated method of determining adaptive weighting coefficients is developed in this paper. The key idea is that the confidence of a prediction is measured by the inverse of a prediction variance. Adaptive weighting coefficients are then derived to depend on past network performance and the confidence of current predictions. Therefore, a committee machine can properly determine coefficients according to past performance and prediction confidence of networks. The effectiveness of a new combination method is illustrated by power market cleaning price prediction.;"Committee machines; Market clearing price forecasting; Neural networks";"Approximation theory; Data acquisition; Forecasting; Probability; Problem solving; Committee machines; Price forecasting; Neural networks";5;1;1;2
Zhang L., Luh P.B.;Power market clearing price prediction and confidence interval estimation with fast neural network learning;2002;Proceedings of the IEEE Power Engineering Society Transmission and Distribution Conference;13;Market clearing prices (MCPs) play an important role in a deregulated power market, and good MCP prediction and interval estimation will help utilities and independent power producers submit effective bids with low risks in this uncertain market. Since MCP is a non-stationary process, an adaptive algorithm with fast convergence is important. A common method for MCP prediction is neural networks, and multilayer perceptron networks (MLP) is one of the widely used networks. Back propagation (BP) is a popular learning method for MLP, while BP suffers from slow convergence. This paper presents an integrated learning and interval estimation algorithm for MCP prediction. In the extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework, confidence interval is a natural by-product of EKF, and is integrated with learning process to improve learning results in addition to fast convergence. Since Kalman filter (KF) is a minimum variance estimator for linear system, EKF framework helps to provide a smaller confidence interval, which is preferred in risk management. Testing results on New England MCP prediction show the integrated learning and confidence interval algorithm provides better prediction than BP algorithm and the confidence interval is smaller with reasonable coverage than a Bayesian inference-based interval estimation method.;"Confidence interval; Extended Kalman filter; Market clearing price; Neural networks; Power systems; Prediction methods; Risk management";"Algorithms; Deregulation; Finance; Kalman filtering; Learning systems; Neural networks; Risk management; Price prediction; Electric power systems";5;1;1;2
Niimura T., Ko H.-S., Ozawa K.;A day-ahead electricity price prediction based on a fuzzy-neuro autoregressive model in a deregulated electricity market;2002;Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks;38;This paper presents a fuzzy regression model to estimate uncertain electricity market prices in deregulated industry environment. The price of electricity in a deregulated market is very volatile in time. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate an accurate market price using historically observed data. In the proposed method, uncertain market prices are estimated by an autoregressive model using a neural network, and the time series model is extended to fuzzy model to consider the possible ranges of market prices. The neural network finds the crisp value for AR model and then the low and high ranges of fuzzy model are found by linear programming. Therefore, the proposed model can represent the possible ranges of a day-ahead market price. For a numerical example, the model is applied to California Power Exchange market data.;"Autoregression; Electricity market; Fuzzy numbers; Neural network; Price; Time series";"Algorithms; Deregulation; Electric industry; Fees and charges; Forecasting; Fuzzy sets; Linear programming; Marketing; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Autoregression; Electricity market; Electricity price prediction; Fuzzy regression model; Multilayer neural networks";4, 5;1;1;1

Johnsen T.A.;Demand, generation and price in the Norwegian market for electric power;2001;Energy Economics;41;We analyse the simultaneous determination of supply, demand and price in the competitive Norwegian electricity market. Deregulated in 1991, this market is pretty mature and it offers numerous data required carrying out an interesting study. Stochastic and seasonal water inflow, water storage possibilities and demand variations make this market interesting both from a theoretical and empirical view. We establish a small supply-demand model of the Norwegian electricity market. The model is estimated using weekly data from 1994 to 1995. Data for 1996 are used for post-sample examination of the model. Unexpected inflow, snow and temperature conditions explain a large part of the variation in the electricity generation, demand and price. Within and post-sample simulation of the estimated model reproduce demand and price patterns considerably well. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Kian A., Keyhani A.;Stochastic price modeling of electricity in deregulated energy markets;2001;Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences;34;In this paper the problem of modeling electricity price dynamics in deregulated energy markets is studied. Since the nature of customers' energy consumption, market participants' strategic behavior and the power system reliability indices are stochastic processes, the electricity price model will be stochastic as well. In our analysis the price of electricity is modeled based on the customers' hourly consumption, day-ahead/real-time energy prices, generation and transmission outage schedules (evaluation of the power system reliability indices), spinning reserve requirements, demand elasticity and predicted strategic behavior of market participants.;"Bidding strategies; Deregulated energy markets; Energy price; Optimal pricing tariffs; Price estimation; Spinning reserve price; Stochastic modeling; VOLL; Zonal model";"Electric load management; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Energy utilization; Random processes; Reliability theory; Strategic planning; Deregulated energy markets; Electric rates";4;1;1;1
Ni E., Luh P.B.;Forecasting power market clearing price and its discrete PDF using a Bayesian-based classification method;2001;Proceedings of the IEEE Power Engineering Society Transmission and Distribution Conference;49;Neural network methods have been successfully used for various applications. In time series prediction problems, the regression models such as multiple layer perceptron (MLP) and the radial basis function network (RBF) are usually applied. However, they cannot predict the probability density function (PDF) that is critical for some applications. When there is noise or corrupt data in the process, these regression models could be misled, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. In this paper, a classification method combined with a simple regression model is presented to predict the discrete PDF of power market clearing prices, which is critical for many decision-makings such as optimizing bidding strategies, and is very difficult to predict because of high market uncertainties. Our basic idea is to form a number of classes by discretizing the variable to be predicted, and thus converts the time series prediction problem into a pattern classification problem. The classes are clustered based on historical data, and the input statistics (e.g., input mean and covariance matrix, etc.) corresponding to each class are obtained via clustering. Given a new input, these classes are sorted according to the posterior probabilities calculated by using the Bayes’ formula. The prediction is then generated by using an auto-regression method (AR) for the classes with high posterior probabilities. The classes are then updated after the actual output is available. The method developed can be seen as an RBF with variable structure. The posterior probabilities can be viewed as an approximation of the discrete PDF, providing valuable information for decision-makes and for what if analysis. The developed method has been used to predict the on-peak and off-peak average MCPs in the New England market. The testing results show that it outperforms the RBF network in terms of prediction accuracy and computational time.;"Auto-regression; Bayes’ rule; Classification; Deregulated electric power markets; MCP prediction";"Decision support systems; Electric power systems; Marketing; Multilayer neural networks; Probability density function; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Uncertain systems; Bayesian classification method; Power market clearing price; Regression model; Electric load forecasting";4;1;1;1

Forecasting the hourly market clearing prices and quantities in daily power markets is the most essential task and basis for any decision making. One approach to predict the market behaviors is to use the historical prices, quantities and other information to forecast the future prices and quantities. The basic idea is to use history and other estimated factors in the future to ""fit"" and ""extrapolate"" the prices and quantities. Aiming at this challenging task, we developed a neural network method to forecast the MCPs and MCQs for the California day-ahead energy markets. The structure of the neural network is a three-layer back propagation (BP) network.

There are numerous practical difficulties in allowing financial mechanisms to direct investments and operations for the generation and distribution of electricity. The electric commodity must be generated, distributed and consumed in real-time under strict physical laws and extremely high reliability requirements. This process is far more exacting and complex then the distribution of traditional commodities, such as oil or agricultural products. Clearly, assessing the effectiveness of deregulated markets is of extreme importance. © 1999 IEEE.;;"Agricultural products; Commerce; Deregulation; Economics; Electric power systems; Laws and legislation; Power markets; Deregulated markets; Direct investments; Electricity prices; Engineering aspects; Forecasting electricity; High reliability; Market regulation; Time series method; Investments";−1;−1;−1;−1

Several tariffs in use include marginal based terms that, however, may be very dependent on load levels or load uncertainties. In this paper we present a fuzzy set based approach to deal with load uncertainties in order to compute local marginal prices. This approach is based on a DC Fuzzy Optimal Power Flow algorithm integrating an estimate of active losses.
