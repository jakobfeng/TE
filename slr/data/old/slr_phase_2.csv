"Westgaard S., Fleten S.-E., Negash A., Botterud A., Bogaard K., Verling T.H.",Performing price scenario analysis and stress testing using quantile regression: A case study of the Californian electricity market,2021,Energy,,"This paper uses quantile regression to demonstrate how electricity price distributions are linked to fundamental supply and demand variables. It investigates the California electricity market (zone SP15) for selected trading hours using data from January 8, 2013 to September 24, 2016. The approach quantifies a non-linear relationship between the fundamentals and electricity prices, just as predicted by the merit order curve. Natural gas, greenhouse gas allowance prices and load all have a positive effect on electricity prices, with the effect increasing with the quantiles. In contrast, solar production and wind production both have a negative effect on electricity prices. The effect of solar production increases with quantiles, whereas the effect of wind production decreases with quantiles. This paper also includes a stress testing case study in which a producer faces the risk of high solar and wind production, and investigates the effect on the lower tail of the price distribution. Overall, the results demonstrate how the proposed approach can be a helpful risk management tool for participants in the electricity market. © 2020 The Author(s)",California electricity market; Quantile regression; Risk management,Costs; Electric industry; Greenhouse gases; Power markets; Risk management; Electricity prices; Non-linear relationships; Price scenarios; Quantile regression; Solar and winds; Solar production; Stress Testing; Supply and demand; Greenhouse effect; electricity; energy market; performance assessment; regression analysis; scenario analysis; testing method; California; United States,4,2,1,2
Jasiński T.,Use of new variables based on air temperature for forecasting day-ahead spot electricity prices using deep neural networks: A new approach,2020,Energy,,"The paper presents a way of creating three new, innovative variables based on air temperature to be used in forecasts of electricity demand and prices. The forecasting methods developed so far, especially in the area of energy prices, either did not use temperature data or were based on data that had not undergone pre-processing, which made it difficult for the model to use their potential. Newly developed variables have a linear relationship with the demand for electricity. This paper describes in detail the procedure for determining the parameters of new variables using the electricity market in Poland (a country in Central Europe) as a case study. The proposed approach allows both to avoid data clustering into different seasons and to precisely determine the temperatures at which the nature of the dependence with the demand for electricity changes. The validity of the proposed new variables in prognostic models has been confirmed by their use in deep neural networks. The proposed approach allows reducing the sMAPE by up to 15.3%. The designed new explanatory variables can be used not only in models based on artificial intelligence tools, but also in other forecasting methods that allow the use of exogenous inputs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Air temperature-based variable; Artificial neural network; Electricity price; Forecasting,Atmospheric temperature; Clustering algorithms; Costs; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Neural networks; Artificial intelligence tools; Electricity demands; Explanatory variables; Forecasting methods; Linear relationships; Prognostic model; Spot electricity prices; Temperature data; Power markets; air temperature; artificial neural network; computer simulation; demand-side management; electricity supply; energy planning; forecasting method; price determination; Poland [Central Europe],5,2,1,1
"Narajewski M., Ziel F.",Ensemble forecasting for intraday electricity prices: Simulating trajectories,2020,Applied Energy,,"Recent studies concerning the point electricity price forecasting have shown evidence that the hourly German Intraday Continuous Market is weak-form efficient. Therefore, we take a novel, advanced approach to the problem. A probabilistic forecasting of the hourly intraday electricity prices is performed by simulating trajectories in every trading window to receive a realistic ensemble to allow for more efficient intraday trading and redispatch. A generalized additive model is fitted to the price differences with the assumption that they follow a zero-inflated distribution, precisely a mixture of the Dirac and the Student's t-distributions. Moreover, the mixing term is estimated using a high-dimensional logistic regression with lasso penalty. We model the expected value and volatility of the series using i.a. autoregressive and no-trade effects or load, wind and solar generation forecasts and accounting for the non-linearities in e.g. time to maturity. Both the in-sample characteristics and forecasting performance are analysed using a rolling window forecasting study. Multiple versions of the model are compared to several benchmark models and evaluated using probabilistic forecasting measures and significance tests. The study aims to forecast the price distribution in the German Intraday Continuous Market in the last 3 h of trading, but the approach allows for application to other continuous markets, especially in Europe. The results prove superiority of the mixture model over the benchmarks gaining the most from the modelling of the volatility. They also indicate that the introduction of XBID reduced the market volatility. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Continuous-trade markets; Electricity price forecasting; Ensemble forecasting; Generalized additive models; Intraday market; Lasso; Logistic regression; Power markets; Probabilistic forecasting; Scenario simulation; Short-term forecasting; Trajectories; XBID; Zero-inflated distribution,Commerce; Costs; Logistic regression; Mixtures; Solar power generation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Ensemble forecasting; Forecasting performance; Generalized additive model; Market volatility; Probabilistic forecasting; Student's t distribution; Forecasting; electricity; ensemble forecasting; market conditions; performance assessment; price determination; simulation; Europe,4,1,2,2
"Heydari A., Majidi Nezhad M., Pirshayan E., Astiaso Garcia D., Keynia F., De Santoli L.",Short-term electricity price and load forecasting in isolated power grids based on composite neural network and gravitational search optimization algorithm,2020,Applied Energy,2,"Electricity price forecasting is a key aspect for market participants to maximize their economic efficiency in deregulated markets. Nevertheless, due to its non-linearity and non-stationarity, the trend of the price is usually complicated to predict. On the other hand, the accuracy of short-term electricity price and load forecasting is fundamental for an efficient management of electric systems. An accurate prediction can benefit future plans and economic operations of the power systems’ operators. In this paper, a new and accurate combined model has been proposed for short-term load forecasting and short-term price forecasting in deregulated power markets. It includes variational mode decomposition, mix data modeling, feature selection, generalized regression neural network and gravitational search algorithm. A mixed data model for the price and load forecast has been considered and integrated with the original signal series of price and load and their decomposition. Throughout this model, the candidate input variables are chosen by a distinct hybrid feature selection. Two reliable electricity markets (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland and Spanish electricity markets) have been used to test the proposed forecasting model and the obtained results have been compared with different valid benchmark prediction models. Lastly, the real load data of Favignana Island's power grid have been considered to test the proposed model. The obtained results pinpointed that the proposed model's precision and stability is higher than in other benchmark forecasting models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price forecasting; Feature selection; Generalized Regression Neural Network; Load forecasting; Optimization algorithm; Power grid management,Deregulation; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Predictive analytics; Deregulated power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Generalized regression neural networks; Gravitational search algorithms; Hybrid feature selections; Short term load forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Spanish electricity markets; Electric load forecasting; algorithm; artificial neural network; benchmarking; electricity generation; electricity supply; forecasting method; market conditions; nonlinearity; optimization; power plant; precision; prediction; Aegadian Islands; Favignana; Italy; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; Sicily; Trapani; United States,5,2,2,1
"Halužan M., Verbič M., Zorić J.",Performance of alternative electricity price forecasting methods: Findings from the Greek and Hungarian power exchanges,2020,Applied Energy,1,"This paper evaluates the performance of alternative algorithms for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. Forecasting performance is assessed based on evidence from the Greek and Hungarian Power Market simulation. The electricity price formation process is simulated on a long time series spanning from January 2015 to September 2018. The EPF models are structured upon the explanatory variables that are available to the market participants before the exchange gate closure, through the publicly available ENTSO-E transparency platform. Relationships between the electricity spot price and explanatory variables are estimated by the selected econometric, data mining, and machine learning algorithms. The econometric autoregressive model with exogeneous explanatory variables is a benchmark model, as the other alternative approaches are used to overcome the linearity bias in the ordinary least squares estimator. We analyse the impact of a different training sample size as well as the impact of training on an hourly clustered sample on the forecasting performance. The support vector machine algorithm turned out to be the best alternative approach, with the lowest mean absolute error and statistically confirmed better forecasts compared to the benchmark econometric autoregressive model. The majority of the tested algorithms perform better with smaller training samples, whereas neural network based approaches prefer large training samples. Models with hourly clustered training samples have higher accuracy based on the Hungarian evidence, while hourly non-clustered training is a superior training method based on the Greek findings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial neural networks; Data mining; Electricity price forecasting; ENTSOE-E transparency platform; Greek power exchange; Hungarian power exchange; Learning sample size; Machine learning; Rolling-window,Data mining; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Power quality; Sampling; Support vector machines; Alternative algorithms; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Forecasting performance; Network-based approach; Ordinary least squares estimators; Power market simulation; Support vector machine algorithm; Power markets; accuracy assessment; algorithm; alternative energy; artificial neural network; econometrics; error analysis; machine learning; numerical model; performance assessment; support vector machine; time series; vector autoregression; Alfold; Hungary,5,1,2,1
"Lisi F., Shah I.",Forecasting next-day electricity demand and prices based on functional models,2020,Energy Systems,,"Efficient modeling and forecasting of electricity demand and prices is an important issue in competitive electricity markets. This work investigates the forecasting performance of several models for the 1-day-ahead prediction of demand and prices on four electricity markets (APX Power-UK, Nord Pool, PJM and IPEX). All the models are based on two steps: a nonparametric estimation of some deterministic components, followed by the choice of a suitable model for the residual stochastic component. This latter step includes univariate and multivariate as well as parametric and nonparametric models, with particular emphasis on the functional approach, that models the whole daily profile as a single functional observation. More specifically, the models involved are: a linear model and a nonlinear (nonparametric) autoregressive model, a vector autoregressive model and four autoregressive functional specifications. Prediction covers a whole year. Comparisons are based both on descriptive statistics and on statistical tests of equal forecasting accuracy. Though results partly depend on specific markets, a double functional model always proved to be the best- or no different from the best-model, highlighting the effectiveness of the functional approach. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","APX, NP, IPEX, PJM; Electricity demand forecasting; Electricity prices forecasting; Functional models; Nonparametric models","Commerce; Costs; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; APX, NP, IPEX, PJM; Electricity demand forecasting; Electricity prices forecasting; Functional model; Non-parametric model; Power markets",4,2,2,2

This paper proposes a self-adaptive, decomposed, heterogeneous, and ensemble learning model for short-term electricity price forecasting one, two, and three-months-ahead in the Brazilian market. Exogenous variables, such as supply, lagged prices and demand are considered as inputs signals of the forecasting model. Firstly, the coyote optimization algorithm is adopted to tune the hyperparameters of complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition in the pre-processing phase. Next, three machine learning models, including extreme learning machine, gradient boosting machine, and support vector regression models, as well as Gaussian process, are designed with the intent of handling the components obtained through the signal decomposition approach with focus on time series forecasting. The individual forecasting models are directly integrated in order to obtain the final forecasting prices one to three-months-ahead. In this case, a grid of forecasting models is obtained. The best forecasting model is the one that has better generalization out-of-sample. The empirical results show the efficiency of the proposed model. Additionally, it can achieve forecasting errors lower than 4.2% in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error. The ranking of importance of the variables, from the smallest to the largest is, lagged prices, demand, and supply. This paper provided useful insights for multi-step-ahead forecasting in the electrical market, once the proposed model can enhance forecasting accuracy and stability. © 2020 by the authors.

Ghasemi-Marzbali A.,"A developed short-term electricity price and load forecasting method based on data processing, support vector machine, and virus colony search",2020,Energy Efficiency,,"Surely, electricity market participants need an accurate estimate for the price and load signals to properly manage their programs to increase their profits. Regarding the two-way interaction between suppliers and consumers, they are able to manage their required profile. Therefore, the individual price or load forecasting is not acceptable and cannot capture their related pattern. Therefore, this paper presents a new forecasting method for price and load signals in simultaneous configuration. This method consists of three main parts: the first part proposes two data preprocessing methods based on wavelet transform to remove noisy term and mutual information to select best features with maximum relevancy and minimum redundancy. The second part suggests a learning engine based on a least square support vector machine (LSSVM) with self-adaptive kernel functions and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) time series to extract the linear and nonlinear patterns. Finally, the last part employs a new modified virus colony search algorithm (VCS) to efficiently set the LSSVM control parameters to use its all capacity. Simulations are carried out for three well-known Australia’s, New York’s, and Ontario’s electricity markets. The obtained results show the acceptable results. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Feature selection; Optimization; Price/load forecast; Smart grid; Support vector machine; Wavelet transform,Data handling; Electric power plant loads; Forecasting; Learning systems; Power markets; Support vector machines; Viruses; Wavelet transforms; Adaptive kernel functions; Data preprocessing; Forecasting methods; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity; Least square support vector machines; Market participants; Mutual informations; Two-way interaction; Electric load forecasting; algorithm; data processing; electricity supply; forecasting method; optimization; pattern recognition; price determination; smart grid; support vector machine; transform,5,1,1,1
"Zhang Y., Deng C., Zhao R., leto S.",A novel integrated price and load forecasting method in smart grid environment based on multi-level structure,2020,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,,"Prediction of load and price are two critical key in power system planning and operation. Most of the recent works in this area forecast the load and price signals separately but, a dynamic model in smart grid is evaluated while, the customers may have opportunity to react the proposed prices changing through shifting the electricity usages from expensive to cheaper hours. So, the load and price signals are coupled strongly which made the previous prediction models ineffective. In this research, a synthetic prediction approach has been proposed by considering the load and price signals, simultaneously. This method works as multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model based on least square support vector machine (LSSVM) forecast engine. Furthermore, a dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) is suggested in this approach to decompose the original signal into different small sub-signals. Beside of that, the modified mutual information (MMI) filter has been used to choose the best candidate input of forecast engine. The learning section is also coupled with novel modified optimization algorithm based on gravitational search algorithm (GSA) which called as modified GSA (MGSA). Finally, various forecasting errors have been considered as average mean absolute percentage error and error variance to get the comparison outcomes and performance of forecasting approaches. For this purpose, different markets have been considered as test case to show the efficiency of suggested approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",DWT; Feature selection; Load and price prediction; LSSVM; MIMO model; Smart grids,Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission networks; Engines; Errors; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; MIMO systems; Predictive analytics; Signal processing; Smart power grids; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Dyadic wavelet transform; Gravitational search algorithm (GSA); Least square support vector machines; Mean absolute percentage error; Multi-input-multi-output models; Optimization algorithms; Power system planning and operation; Price and load forecasting; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1

In this paper, a new bidding strategy model has been presented based on the Genetic Algorithm and a refined Monte Carlo simulation model. This process is done through the similarity function and consideration of the seasonality trend as the main characteristic of the electricity spot price. The main contributions of this paper include: (a): Consideration of the similarity value for all days in historical dates in the database, (b): Consideration of the seasonality trend of market clearing price by applying K-Means algorithm for clustering historical data based on demand, (c): Application of the proposed model for each cluster's data, (d): Performance evaluation of the fitness function of each generated strategy by a simulation model based on historical data.

"Fu T., Zhang S., Wang C.",Application and research for electricity price forecasting system based on multi-objective optimization and sub-models selection strategy,2020,Soft Computing,,"In general, electricity prices reflect the cost to build, finance, maintain, and operate power plants and the electricity grid. Therefore, the cost-optimized scheduling of industrial loads with accurate price forecasts is very important. As such, recent studies have attempted to combine models to forecast electricity prices more accurately. Earlier combined models have tended to ignore the selection of sub-models and data analyses, leading to poor forecasting performance. In order to select the best forecasting models in a combined model, we propose a hybrid electricity price forecasting system that includes a data analysis module, a sub-model selection strategy module, optimized forecasting processing, and a model evaluation module. As such, the hybrid system fully exploits the advantages of a single model, thus improving the forecasting performance of the combined model. The experimental results show that the proposed system selects optimal sub-models effectively and successfully identifies future trend changes in the electricity price. Thus, the system can be an effective tool in the planning and implementation of smart grids. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Combined model; Electricity prices; Hybrid forecasting system; Sub-models selection strategy,Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Multiobjective optimization; Power plants; Electricity grids; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting models; Forecasting performance; Industrial loads; Model evaluation; Price forecasts; Power markets,5,1,1,1
"Muniain P., Ziel F.",Probabilistic forecasting in day-ahead electricity markets: Simulating peak and off-peak prices,2020,International Journal of Forecasting,6,"In this article we include dependency structures for electricity price forecasting and forecasting evaluation. We work with off-peak and peak time series from the German-Austrian day-ahead price; hence, we analyze bivariate data. We first estimate the mean of the two time series, and then in a second step we estimate the residuals. The mean equation is estimated by ordinary least squares and the elastic net, and the residuals are estimated by maximum likelihood. Our contribution is to include a bivariate jump component in a mean reverting jump diffusion model in the residuals. The models’ forecasts are evaluated with use of four different criteria, including the energy score to measure whether the correlation structure between the time series is properly included. It is observed that the models with bivariate jumps provide better results with the energy score, which means that it is important to consider this structure to properly forecast correlated time series. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters",Bivariate Bernoulli; Dependency structure; Elastic net estimation; Electricity price forecasting; Energy score; Ensemble forecasting; Forecasting evaluation; GARCH; Jump diffusion process; Pinball score,,"3, 4",2,1,2
"Fang X., Cui M.",Analytical model of day-ahead and real-time price correlation in strategic wind power offering,2020,Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy,,"In this paper, the model of strategic wind power offering in the day-ahead (DA) market is proposed considering the uncertainties of wind power production, and price forecasting of DA and real-time (RT) market. The wind power deviation in the RT market is settled with the two-price mechanism based on the deviation direction and the relation between the locational marginal prices (LMPs) of DA and RT. Instead of using the point forecasting for the DA and RT LMPs, the uncertainties of LMP forecasting are modeled. In addition, the correlation between the forecasting errors of DA and RT LMP are directly modeled instead of generating the correlated scenarios. Finally, the opitmal offered quantity of wind power in the DA market is derived using the probability theory based on the probabilistic wind power forecasting. The case study using the price data of actual DA and RT from Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) validates the effectiveness of the proposed model. It shows that the correlation of the forecasting errors of DA and RT LMP has a significant impact on the wind power quantity offered by DA and revenue results. © 2020, Springer.

Marcjasz G.,Forecasting electricity prices using deep neural networks: A robust hyper-parameter selection scheme,2020,Energies,1,"Deep neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity. However, their application requires setting multiple hyper-parameters, and the performance relies strongly on this choice. We address this issue and propose a robust ex-ante hyper-parameter selection procedure for the day-ahead electricity price forecasting that, when used jointly with a tested forecast averaging scheme, yields high performance throughout three-year long out-of-sample test periods in two distinct markets. Being based on a grid search with models evaluated on long samples, the methodology mitigates the noise induced by local optimization. Forecast averaging across calibration window lengths and hyper-parameter sets allows the proposed methodology to outperform a parameter-rich least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-estimated model and a deep neural network (DNN) with non-optimized hyper-parameters in terms of the mean absolute forecast error. © 2020 by the author.

Most electricity market organizers in the world release the data of LMP along with its three components, i.e., the energy, congestion, and loss components. The series of the three components have their own patterns and driving factors, and can be utilized to improve the accuracy of LMP forecasting. However, most existing studies have focused on direct LMP forecasting and have barely noticed this characteristic. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between the released data of the three components and LMP forecasting through a componential and ensemble approach. Three individual forecasting models are selected and trained for these components, and an ensemble framework that stacks the summation LMP results and the direct results is proposed to enhance the overall accuracy and robustness.

The main aim of this study is to comparatively examine the wind generation forecasts in Poland and Portugal, as well as to verify their influence on the day-ahead market prices. The statistical analysis revealed significant deviations of the forecasted and actual wind production in both countries, which referred to the corresponding spot and balancing prices caused considerable financial losses by the wind energy suppliers.

The results have shown that the usability of the information of forecasted wind generation is not unequivocal in models developed for spot prices in Poland, mainly because of the randomness and volatility of recorded wind generation forecasts. However, in the case of Portugal, the forecasted wind generation occurred to be a valuable input in spot prices models, which results in an improvement in the models’ accuracy. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the proposed methods are strongly dependent on expert knowledge and may not be directly transferred from one to another model or market. Hence, we consider a novel extension and propose to use principal component analysis (PCA) to automate the procedure of averaging over a rich pool of predictions. We apply PCA to a panel of over 650 point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows length. The robustness of the approach is evaluated with three different forecasting tasks, i.e., forecasting day-ahead prices, forecasting intraday ID3 prices one day in advance, and finally very short term forecasting of ID3 prices (i.e., six hours before delivery). The empirical results are compared using the Mean Absolute Error measure and Giacomini and White test for conditional predictive ability (CPA).

"Gulay E., Duru O.",Hybrid modeling in the predictive analytics of energy systems and prices,2020,Applied Energy,,"The aim of this paper is to illustrate the nature of the residuals of a forecasting process and to propose a hybrid approach with linear and nonlinear components predicted by corresponding methodologies. It is a common practice that residuals are assumed to be unpredictable or are reiterated into a model as lagged variables to capture any information remaining in the residual data. The central argument of this paper is that residuals from energy price forecasting can still carry predictive information in its complex and nonlinear form. Although the linear modeling is initially very accurate, reiterating residuals in linear structures is a mismatch of data type and methodology. In this regard, the proposed algorithm hybridizes or combines linear components captured by the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) and nonlinear components processed by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve post-sample accuracy.

The electricity prices have an impact on the behavior of market participants, and thus, predicting prices for generation companies, and consumers is essential for both the short-term profits in the Day-Ahead, Intra-Day and Ancillary markets, and the long-term benefits in the future planning, investment, and risk management. Therefore, participants in the electricity market need to accurately and effectively predict the price signal to manage market risk. In this paper, different forecasting models have been compared, and the most promising ones have been employed to forecast the short term Italian electricity market clearing price for achieving forecasting accuracy. In particular, simulations are performed for four principal regression methods, including Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Processes Regression, Regression Trees, and Multi-Layer Perceptron.

However, despite this significance, electricity price forecasting remains a challenging task. Hybrid models are widely employed for forecasting electricity price, which has the characteristics of being non-stationarity, random, and non-linear. Despite their success, current hybrid models require improvement. In particular, data preprocessing, artificial intelligence optimization, feature selection, and basic forecasting engine selection should be considered. In this study, in addition to these issues, we consider the negative influence of outliers on the modeling of electricity price. In particular, a novel outlier-robust hybrid model is developed for forecasting electricity price, which combines a basic forecasting engine called outlier-robust extreme learning machine model and three new algorithms. Specifically, a new optimizer called chaotic sine cosine algorithm is developed to obtain the ideal parameters for phase space reconstruction, and then a novel feature selection method is developed to construct the optimal features in the modeling of electricity price. Moreover, an effective data preprocessing method is proposed for effective forecasting by capturing electricity price features. Subsequently, experiments based on electricity price data from the electricity markets of Australia and Singapore demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to other benchmark models.

In this context, some current forecasting systems use data preprocessing and optimization for theoretical and practical achievements. However, some limitations to these systems exist which need to be urgently solved. First, future information is overdrawn in the data preprocessing stage of these forecasting systems, which is actually unknown in practical applications. The crucial question, therefore, is how to develop a forecasting system without using any future information. Second, the complex features of original nonlinear and nonstationary electricity price have a negative influence on the generalization ability of these previously developed models. To decrease the negative effects on management, a method to develop a forecasting system to improve the model's generalization ability is required.

More specifically, parametric (FAR) and nonparametric (NPFAR) functional autoregressive models are considered and compared to some benchmarks. An appealing feature of the functional approach is that, unlike other methods, it provides insights into the sale and purchase mechanism connected with the price and demand formation process and can therefore be used for the optimization of bidding strategies.

Also demand-side management and short-term scheduling operations in smart grids do not require strictly very accurate forecast and can be executed with certain practical price thresholds. This paper, therefore, presents a multikernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) for both short-term electricity price forecasting and classification according to some prespecified price thresholds. The kernel ELM does not require the hidden layer mapping function to be known and produces robust prediction and classification in comparison with the conventional ELM using random weights between the input and hidden layers. Further in the MKELM formulation, the linear combination of the weighted kernels is optimized using vaporization precipitation-based water cycle algorithm (WCA) to produce significantly accurate electricity price prediction and classification. The combination of MKELM and WCA is named as WCA-MKELM in this work.

In practice, these prices are highly volatile as they largely depend upon a range of variables such as electricity demand and the feed-in from renewable energy sources. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to provide accurate forecasts. Design/methodology/approach: This paper aims at comparing different predictors stemming from supply-side (solar and wind power generation), demand-side, fuel-related and economic influences. For this reason, this paper implements a broad range of non-linear models from machine learning and draw upon the information-fusion-based sensitivity analysis. Findings: This study disentangles the respective relevance of each predictor. This study shows that external predictors altogether decrease root mean squared errors by up to 21.96%. A Diebold-Mariano test statistically proves that the forecasting accuracy of the proposed machine learning models is superior. Research limitations/implications: The performance gain from including more predictors might be larger than from a better model.

Being able to predict these prices accurately may help with the identification of customer needs and the effective regulation of the power grid by power producers. It may also help electric power traders to manage risks, make correct decisions, and obtain more benefits. In this paper, a novel hybrid model is proposed for short-term electricity price prediction. The model consists of three algorithms: Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD); a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). This is called SEPNet for convenience. The annual electricity price data is divided into seasons because of seasonal differences in the time series of electricity prices. The VMD algorithm is used to decompose the complex time series of electricity prices into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different center frequencies. The CNN is used to further extract the time-domain features for all the intrinsic model functions in the VMD domain. The GRU is then employed to process and learn the time-domain features extracted by the CNN, leading to the final prediction. A comparison is made with five models, such as LSTM, CNN, VMD-CNN, BP, VMD-ELMAN. The results showed that the proposed model had the best performance, and it was found that using VMD can improve the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the four seasons by 84% and 81%, respectively. The addition of GRU in the SEPNet model further improved the MAPE and RMSE by 19% and 25%, respectively. Including CNN and VMD-CNN, that shows that the proposed model has the best performance. The MAPE and RMSE for the four seasonal averages are 0.730% and 0.453, respectively. This confirms that the SEPNet model has the feasibility and high accuracy to predict short-term electricity prices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",convolutional neural network; electricity price forecasting; gated recurrent unit; intrinsic mode function; variational mode decomposition,Backpropagation; Convolutional neural networks; Costs; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Internet of things; Mean square error; Power markets; Predictive analytics; Time series; Complex time series; Electricity price forecasting; Intrinsic Mode functions; Mean absolute percentage error; Neural network model; Root mean square errors; Seasonal differences; Time domain features; Long short-term memory,5,1,1,1

However, it is very difficult to estimate the electricity energy production in advance and store the rest of the electric energy due to the climate, environment, population and other factors. Based on data preprocessing and artificial intelligence optimization algorithm, this paper introduces a combined forecasting method. The proposed method contains six individual methods, and each individual method has its own usage. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is adopted to reduce noise from the original data; three individual forecasting methods, Jordan neural network, the echo state network, least squares support vector machine, are applied to obtain the intermediate forecasting results; two optimization algorithms, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing, are used to optimize the parameters of the combined model. This paper not only validates the superiority of the combined model compared to the single predictive model through the simulation experiments of power load data and electricity price data. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of the combined power load and electricity price forecast results are 1.14% and 7.58%, respectively, which are higher than the MAPE error of the corresponding single models prediction results. It has also been verified that the process of eliminating noise by the SSA plays a positive role in the accuracy of the combined forecasting model. In addition, two series of experiments on the power load data lead to two very interesting conclusions. One of the conclusions is that as the size of the test data increases, the prediction accuracy of the model decreases; the other is that the predicted result calculated through the optimized combined weight is better than the combined result calculated using the average weight, and the average weight is used.

To achieve aforementioned objective, a model is proposed which consists of two stages; feature engineering and forecasting. Feature engineering includes feature extraction and feature selection to reduce dimensionality. Mutual Information (MI) is used for feature extraction. Random forest and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is used for feature selection. For prediction of load and price, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Improved Convolutional Neural Network (ICNN) are used. However, ICNN beats MLP and CNN with 81% accuracy.

"Marcjasz G., Uniejewski B., Weron R.",Beating the naïve-combining lasso with naïve intraday electricity price forecasts,2020,Energies,6,"In the last three decades the vast majority of electricity price forecasting (EPF) research has concerned day-ahead markets. However, the rapid expansion of renewable generation-mostly wind and solar-have shifted the focus to intraday markets, which can be used to balance the deviations between positions taken in the day-ahead market and the actual demand and renewable generation. A recent EPF study claims that the German intraday, continuous-time market for hourly products is weak-form efficient, that is, that the best predictor for the so-called ID3-Price index is the most recent transaction price. Here, we undermine this claim and show that we can beat the naïve forecast by combining it with a prediction of a parameter-rich model estimated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We further argue, that that if augmented with timely predictions of fundamental variables for the coming hours, the LASSO-estimated model itself can significantly outperform the naïve forecast. © 2020 by the authors.",Averaging forecasts; Fundamental variables; ID3-Price index; Intraday electricity market; LASSO; Price forecasting; Variable selection,Continuous time systems; Forecasting; Fundamental variables; LASSO; Price forecasting; Price index; Variable selection; Power markets,4,1,2,2

The hybrid forecasting framework is intended to capture the dynamic interaction between the electricity consumers and the forecasted prices resulting in the shift of demand curve in electricity market. The proposed model comprises a linear ARMA-FLNN obtained by using a nonlinear expansion of the weighted inputs. The nonlinear functional block helps introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher dimensional space through basis functions. To train the ARMA-FLNN, an ACKF is used to obtain faster convergence and higher forecasting accuracy. The proposed method is tested on several electricity markets, and the performance metrics such as the mean average percentage error (MAPE), and error variance are compared with other forecasting methods, indicating the improved accuracy of the approach and its suitability for a real-time forecasting. © 2019, The Author(s).",Cubature Kalman filter; Mixed demand and price forecasting; Price spikes; Smart grids,Commerce; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Gaussian noise (electronic); Kalman filters; Smart power grids; Adaptive autoregressive; Cubature kalman filters; Electricity consumers; Functional link neural network; Price forecasting; Price spike; Real-time forecasting; Smart grid; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1

Electricity prices are characterized as non-stationary time series data that entail vigorous learning model for predicting the future electricity price from past data. To accomplish this, an enhanced hybrid framework that integrates the refined variational mode decomposition method and the group search optimization algorithm is proposed for training the Elman recurrent neural network. The variational mode decomposition method is optimized using a complement particle swarm optimization method so as to decompose the non-stationary pricing data into optimum number of intrinsic mode functions. Subsequently, based on the power values of intrinsic mode, functions are further filtered and used as the input data to train the Elman neural network.

Electricity is a special commodity that is not storable, so its production and load should always be balanced to maintain a tightly regulated system frequency. Electricity production and load both depend on many factors, such as the weather, temperature, and wind. These characteristics make the dynamics of electricity price very different from that of any other commodities or financial assets. The electricity price can exhibit hourly, daily, and seasonal fluctuations, as well as abrupt unanticipated spikes. Now almost all electricity market participants use wind/load/price forecasting tools in their daily operations to optimize their operation plans, and bidding and hedging strategies, in order to maximize the profits and avoid price risks. However, the unreliable and inaccurate predictions with current forecasting tools have caused many serious problems, which can cause system instabilities and result in extreme prices even in the absence of scarcity.

Nevertheless, because of the high volatility and uncertainty, it is an essential challenge to accurately forecast the electricity price. Considering that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are suitable for processing time series data, in this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based forecasting model, BRIM, which splits the state neurons of a regular RNN into two parts: the forward states (using the historical electricity price information) are designed for processing the data in positive time direction and backward states (using the future price information available at inter-connected markets) for the data in negative time direction. Moreover, due to the fact that inter-connected power exchange markets show a common trend for other neighboring markets and can provide signaling information for each other, it is sensible to incorporate and exploit the impact of the neighboring markets on forecasting accuracy of electricity price. Specifically, future electricity prices of the interconnected market are utilized both as input features for forward LSTM and backward LSTM. By testing on day-ahead electricity prices in the European Power Exchange (EPEX), the experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method BRIM in enhancing predictive accuracy in comparison with the various benchmarks, and moreover Diebold-Mariano (DM) shows that the forecast accuracy of BRIM is not equal to other forecasting models, and thus indirectly demonstrates that BRIM statistically significantly outperforms other schemes. © 2019 by the authors.",Bidirectional recurrent neural network; Deep learning; Electricity price forecasting; Market integration,Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Deep learning; Forecasting; Information use; Long short-term memory; System stability; Bidirectional recurrent neural networks; Competitive environment; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Market integration; Power system stability; Power-exchange market; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Power markets,5,0,1,1

"Luo S., Weng Y.",A two-stage supervised learning approach for electricity price forecasting by leveraging different data sources,2019,Applied Energy,10,"Over the years, the growing penetration of renewable energy into the electricity market has resulted in a significant change in the electricity market price. This change makes the existing forecasting method prone to error, decreasing the economic benefits. Hence, more precise forecasting methods need to be developed. This paper starts with a survey and benchmark of existing machine learning approaches for forecasting the real-time market (RTM) price. While these methods provide sufficient modeling capability via supervised learning, their accuracy is still limited due to the single data source, e.g., historical price information only. In this paper, a novel two-stage supervised learning approach is proposed by diversifying the data sources such as highly correlated power data. This idea is inspired by the recent load forecasting methods that have shown extremely well performances. Specifically, the proposed two-stage method, namely the rerouted method, learns two types of mapping rules. The first one is the mapping between the historical wind power and the historical price. The second is the forecasting rule for wind generation. Based on the two rules, we forecast the price via the forecasted generation and the first learned mapping between power and price. Additionally, we observed that it is not the more training data the better, leading to our validation steps to quantify the best training intervals for different datasets. We conduct comparisons of numerical results between existing methods and the proposed methods based on datasets from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). For each machine learning step, we examine different learning methods, such as polynomial regression, support vector regression, neural network, and deep neural network. The results show that the proposed method is significantly better than existing approaches when renewables are involved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price forecast; Machine learning methods; Renewables; Wind power generation,Commerce; Deep neural networks; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Forecasting; Machine learning; Mapping; Power markets; Supervised learning; Tunneling (excavation); Wind power; Electric reliability council of texas; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Renewables; Supervised learning approaches; Support vector regression (SVR); Numerical methods; alternative energy; artificial neural network; electricity industry; energy planning; forecasting method; historical perspective; numerical method; price determination; supervised learning; wind power; Texas; United States,5,1,1,1

"Díaz G., Coto J., Gómez-Aleixandre J.",Prediction and explanation of the formation of the Spanish day-ahead electricity price through machine learning regression,2019,Applied Energy,6,"Until recently, detailed information on the power system state to estimate future spot prices by regression analysis was generally restricted to qualified parties. However, to ensure transparency in operation, the Spanish Transmission System Operator has launched an informative web in which a sizable amount of real-time energy-related data can be consulted through a graphical interface. Undoubtedly, this provides the opportunity for non-qualified parties to develop applications and algorithms in which price forecast and maybe knowledge about how price is determined are required. This paper approaches the use of data extracted from that interface with two aims: the prediction of the day-ahead price in a simple way, and the exploration of the influence that the underlying energy drivers have on it. For the prediction we specified a quantile regression model based on Gradient Boosted Regression Trees. It improves the accuracy over multiple linear regression models at the cost of more complexity, and still it has simpler specification and tuning compared to other machine learning approaches. The calculated metrics show that our model produces remarkably low prediction errors when using the median as point prediction method (RMSE = 2.78 €/MWh, MAE = 1.94 €/MWh, and MAPE = 0.059). Interestingly, the quantile regression model also allows to inherently define prediction intervals, with a different interpretation of accuracy. Our results show that on average 90% of times the prediction error will not exceed 6.8 €/MWh. We also implemented a partial dependence analysis on that model. This implementation—as far as we know the first time employed to analyze the formation of electricity prices—has shown to be of significant usefulness in detecting highly non-linear relationships. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Day-ahead electricity price; Gradient boosting regression; Linear regression; Principal components; Quantile regression,Costs; Electric power transmission; Forecasting; Linear regression; Machine learning; Electricity prices; Gradient boosting; Machine learning approaches; Multiple linear regression models; Non-linear relationships; Principal Components; Quantile regression; Transmission system operators; Power markets; electricity; energy market; exploration; machine learning; operations technology; prediction; principal component analysis; regression analysis; Spain,5,1,1,2
"Grossi L., Nan F.","Robust forecasting of electricity prices: Simulations, models and the impact of renewable sources",2019,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,7,"In this paper a robust approach to modeling electricity spot prices is introduced. Differently from what has been recently done in the literature on electricity price forecasting, where the attention has been mainly drawn by the prediction of spikes, the focus of this contribution is on the robust estimation of nonlinear SETARX models (Self-Exciting Threshold Auto Regressive models with eXogenous regressors). In this way, parameter estimates are not, or very lightly, influenced by the presence of extreme observations and the large majority of prices, which are not spikes, could be better forecasted. A Monte Carlo study is carried out in order to select the best weighting function for Generalized M-estimators of SETAR processes. A robust procedure to select and estimate nonlinear processes for electricity prices is introduced, including robust tests for stationarity and nonlinearity and robust information criteria. The application of the procedure to the Italian electricity market reveals the forecasting superiority of the robust GM-estimator based on the polynomial weighting function with respect to the non-robust Least Squares estimator. Finally, the introduction of generation from renewable sources in the robust estimation of SETARX processes contributes to the improvement of the forecasting ability of the model. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Electricity price; Nonlinear time series; Price forecasting; Robust GM-estimator; Spikes; Threshold models,Forecasting; Power markets; Time series analysis; Electricity prices; Nonlinear time series; Price forecasting; Robust GM-estimator; Spikes; Threshold model; Cost estimating; computer simulation; electricity generation; energy market; estimation method; forecasting method; nonlinearity; numerical model; renewable resource; time series analysis; Italy,4,1,1,1

In stage I, discrete wavelet transform (db4, level 3) is applied for decomposing the prices of electricity data to a set of constitutive for reducing the variation in the prices data. In stage II, ANFIS is used to forecast the electricity prices. KHA has been adopted in updating the various weights in the ANFIS to get better accuracy. The code of the hybrid algorithm has been developed in MATLAB. The proposed Wavelet-KHA-ANFIS has been tested on the real time system. The simulation results in terms of MAPE, MRSE and APE have been presented. It has been found that the proposed algorithm provides best accuracy in comparison with the existing algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.",Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System; Electricity price forecasting; Krill herd algorithm; Wavelet,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Discrete wavelet transforms; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Inference engines; Interactive computer systems; MATLAB; Real time systems; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Deregulated power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid method; Nonstationary; Wavelet; Power markets,5,1,1,1
"De Marcos R.A., Bello A., Reneses J.",Short-term electricity price forecasting with a composite fundamental-econometric hybrid methodology,2019,Energies,,"Various power exchanges are nowadays being affected by a plethora of factors that, as a whole, cause considerable instabilities in the system. As a result, traders and practitioners must constantly adapt their strategies and look for support for their decision-making when operating in the market. In many cases, this calls for suitable electricity price forecasting models that can account for relevant aspects for electricity price forecasting. Consequently, fundamental-econometric hybrid approaches have been developed by many authors in the literature, although these have rarely been applied in short-term contexts, where other considerations and issues must be addressed. Therefore, this work aims to develop a robust hybrid methodology that is capable of making the most of the advantages fundamental and the hybrid model in a synergistic manner, while also providing insight as to how well these models perform across the year. Several methods have been utilised in this work in order to modify the hybridisation approach and the input datasets for enhanced predictive accuracy.

To make better use of electric energy, great efforts have been paid by electricity market researchers and practitioners on electricity price forecasting. Long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, performs well in many areas, such as language modeling and speech recognition. However, the performance of applying the LSTM model to process time series and nonlinear regression problems is not so satisfactory. Stochastic gradient-based optimization has core practical importance in many scientific and engineering fields. Adam, a method for efficient stochastic optimization, has combined the advantages of two popular optimization methods: AdaGrad and RMSProp, it makes LSTM model perform even better. In this study, two examples were listed to verify the performance of the Adam-optimized LSTM neural network, and the dataset from New South Wales of Australia were adopted to illustrate the excellence of model.

"Naz A., Javed M.U., Javaid N., Saba T., Alhussein M., Aurangzeb K.",Short-term electric load and price forecasting using enhanced extreme learning machine optimization in smart grids,2019,Energies,15,"A Smart Grid (SG) is a modernized grid to provide efficient, reliable and economic energy to the consumers. Energy is the most important resource in the world. An efficient energy distribution is required as smart devices are increasing dramatically. The forecasting of electricity consumption is supposed to be a major constituent to enhance the performance of SG. Various learning algorithms have been proposed to solve the forecasting problem. The sole purpose of this work is to predict the price and load efficiently. The first technique is Enhanced Logistic Regression (ELR) and the second technique is Enhanced Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (ERELM). ELR is an enhanced form of Logistic Regression (LR), whereas, ERELM optimizes weights and biases using a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Relief-F and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) are used for feature selection and extraction. On the basis of selected features, classification is performed using ELR. Cross validation is done for ERELM using Monte Carlo and K-Fold methods. The simulations are performed on two different datasets. The first dataset, i.e., UMass Electric Dataset is multi-variate while the second dataset, i.e., UCI Dataset is uni-variate. The first proposed model performed better with UMass Electric Dataset than UCI Dataset and the accuracy of second model is better with UCI than UMass. The prediction accuracy is analyzed on the basis of four different performance metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed techniques are then compared with four benchmark schemes. The comparison is done to verify the adaptivity of the proposed techniques. The simulation results show that the proposed techniques outperformed benchmark schemes. The proposed techniques efficiently increased the prediction accuracy of load and price. However, the computational time is increased in both scenarios. ELR achieved almost 5% better results than Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and almost 3% than LR. While, ERELM achieved almost 6% better results than ELM and almost 5% than RELM. However, the computational time is almost 20% increased with ELR and 50% with ERELM. Scalability is also addressed for the proposed techniques using half-yearly and yearly datasets. Simulation results show that ELR gives 5% better results while, ERELM gives 6% better results when used for yearly dataset. © 2019 by the authors.",CNN; ELR; ERELM; Forecasting; Load; LR; Price; RELM; Smart grid,Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Errors; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Lawrencium; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Loading; Mean square error; Monte Carlo methods; Neural networks; Power markets; Regression analysis; Classification and regression tree; ERELM; Feature selection and extractions; Mean absolute percentage error; Price; Recursive feature elimination; RELM; Smart grid; Smart power grids,5,1,1,1
"Jufri F.H., Oh S., Jung J.",Day-Ahead System Marginal Price Forecasting Using Artificial Neural Network and Similar-Days Information,2019,Journal of Electrical Engineering and Technology,2,"Day-ahead system marginal price (SMP) forecasting constitutes essential information in the competitive energy market. Hence, this paper presents the development of a day-ahead SMP forecasting model via implementing an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The accuracy of the ANN-based model is improved by including long-term historical data in addition to short-term historical data and by applying the k-fold cross-validation optimization algorithm. The selection of the short-term type input variable applies the Pearson correlation coefficient. Whereas the long-term type input variable is selected by applying the discrete Fréchet distance in conjunction with the information related to the season and type of the day to find the Similar-Days Index. In order to verify the model, the forecasted load and actual SMP for 15 years of historical data are used. The results indicate that the proposed model can forecast SMP with higher accuracy than the conventional forecasting model. © 2019, The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.",Artificial neural network (ANN); Day-ahead SMP forecasting; Similar days; SMP forecasting; System marginal price (SMP),Correlation methods; Forecasting; Neural networks; Day-ahead; Forecasting modeling; Historical data; Input variables; K fold cross validations; Pearson correlation coefficients; Similar day; System marginal price; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1
"Ghayekhloo M., Azimi R., Ghofrani M., Menhaj M.B., Shekari E.",A combination approach based on a novel data clustering method and Bayesian recurrent neural network for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets,2019,Electric Power Systems Research,6,"Electricity price forecasting is an ancillary service that plays a key role for market participants in a deregulated structure. Compared to other commodities, electricity price exhibits higher levels of volatility and uncertainty. This imposes more restrictions on the accuracy of the forecast and leads to significant errors. This paper proposes a hybrid electricity price-forecasting framework with a novel time series data mining method to enhance the feature selection. The proposed method includes clustering, preprocessing and training stages. The proposed data clustering method uses both an enhanced game theoretic approach and neural gas in combination with competitive Hebbian learning to provide a better vector quantization. Six strategies are proposed to enable the non-winning neurons to participate in the learning phase and resolve the shortcomings of the original self-organizing map, where the dead neurons are far from the input patterns without having any chance to compete with the winning neurons. The price-load input data are clustered into a proper number of subsets using the proposed data mining method. A novel cluster selection method based on the persistence approach is applied to select the most appropriate cluster as the input to the BRNN. The selected data set is filtered by the harmonic analysis time series, and is time-series processed to provide the proper inputs for training neural networks. Bayesian approach is used to train a recurrent neural network, and forecast the electricity price. The performance of the proposed clustering algorithm is evaluated using different electricity market data. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed clustering algorithm as compared to K-means, neural gas and self-organizing map clustering methods Our proposed clustering provides 16.7%, 28.6%, and 13% more accurate results than K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map for the NYISO. CAPITL data. For the NYISO. CENTRL data, the developed clustering outperforms the K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map by 21.4%, 21.4%, and 8.3%, respectively. The clustering accuracy of the proposed method for NYISO. DUNWOD data is 5.5%, 19%, and 5.5% better than that of the K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map methods Lastly, for the NYISO.

"Maciejowska K., Nitka W., Weron T.",Day-ahead vs. Intraday—Forecasting the price spread to maximize economic benefits,2019,Energies,17,"Recently, a dynamic development of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) has been observed. In order to allow for the adoption of trading contracts for unplanned events and changing weather conditions, the day-ahead markets have been complemented by intraday markets; in some countries, such as Poland, balancing markets are used for this purpose. This research focuses on a small RES generator, which has no market power and sells electricity through a larger trading company. The generator needs to decide, in advance, how much electricity is sold in the day-ahead market. The optimal decision of the generator on where to sell the production depends on the relation between prices in different markets. Unfortunately, when making the decision, the generator is not sure which market will offer a higher price. This article investigates the possible gains from utilizing forecasts of the price spread between the intraday/balancing and day-ahead markets in the decision process. It shows that the sign of the price spread can be successfully predicted with econometric models, such as ARX and probit. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the statistical measures of forecast accuracy, such as the percentage of correct sign classifications, do not necessarily coincide with economic benefits. © 2019 by the authors.",ARX model; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Forecasting; Price spread; Probit model,Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Renewable energy resources; ARX model; Dynamic development; Electricity prices; Forecast accuracy; Price spread; Probit models; Renewable energy source; Statistical measures; Power markets,4,1,"1, 2",1
"Afanasyev D.O., Fedorova E.A.",On the impact of outlier filtering on the electricity price forecasting accuracy,2019,Applied Energy,5,"Increasing the accuracy of short-term electricity price forecasting allows day-ahead power market participants to obtain a positive economic effect by bidding close to the equilibrium price. However the electricity price time-series is generally infested with extreme values due to high price volatility. This paper discusses the impact of outlier filtering on forecasting accuracy based on a recently introduced seasonal component autoregressive model. We consider such methods of outlier detection (with a priori defined cut-off parameter) as threshold, standard deviation, percentage, recursive, and moving filter on prices. It is shown that such data pre-processing often leads to the forecasting accuracy gain while the error decrease (relative to the approach without filtering) in a number of cases may reach 1.8–1.9% of the average weekly price (in absolute values). For an a priori defined cut-off parameter, the simple threshold and standard deviation filter on prices outperform other considered methods, and yield to the accuracy gain in 63% and 67% of cases, correspondingly. At the same time, in case of the out-of-sample filter parameter grid-optimization all of the methods demonstrate comparable prediction power (equal to the marginal performance). But, practically speaking, such optimization is time-consuming and cannot be carried out on unavailable future data. As an competitive alternative, we propose a combined filter on prices based on a committee machine which uses the results of individual non-optimized algorithms and is not time-consuming, but gives accuracy comparable to the best one obtained for each of the studied electricity markets and leads to forecast gain in 63% of the considered cases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Committee machine; Electricity price forecasting; Long-term trend-seasonal component; Model confidence set; Outlier filtering,Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Forecasting; Statistics; Auto regressive models; Committee machines; Day-ahead power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Long-term trend; Optimized algorithms; Standard deviation; Power markets; accuracy assessment; algorithm; economic conditions; electricity; energy market; optimization; price determination,"4, 5",1,1,1

These data are known as energy big data. The analysis of big data divulges the deeper insights that help experts in the improvement of smart grid's (SG) operations. Processing and extracting of meaningful information from data is a challenging task. Electricity load and price are the most influential factors in the electricity market. For improving reliability, control and management of electricity market operations, an exact estimate of the day ahead load is a substantial requirement. Energy market trade is based on price. Accurate price forecast enables energy market participants to make effective and most profitable bidding strategies. This paper proposes a deep learning-based model for the forecast of price and demand for big data using Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM). Due to the adaptive and automatic feature learning mechanism of Deep Neural Network (DNN), the processing of big data is easier with LSTM as compared to the purely data-driven methods. The proposed model was evaluated using well-known real electricity markets' data. In this study, day and week ahead forecasting experiments were conducted for all months. Forecast performance was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). The proposed Deep LSTM (DLSTM) method was compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) time series forecasting methods, i.e., Nonlinear Autoregressive network with Exogenous variables (NARX) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).

"Cerjan M., Petričić A., Delimar M.",HIRA model for short-term electricity price forecasting,2019,Energies,3,"In competitive power markets, electric utilities, power producers, and traders are exposed to increased risks caused by electricity price volatility. The growing reliance on renewable sources and their dependence on weather, nuclear uncertainty, market coupling, and global financial instability are contributing to the importance of accurate electricity price forecasting. Since power markets are not all equally developed, different price forecasting methods have been introduced for individual markets. The aim of this research is to introduce a short-term electricity price forecasting method that addresses the problems of price volatility, a varying number of input parameters, varying data availability, and a large number of parameters and input data. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used on any market as it targets the characteristics and specifics of each market. The proposed Hybrid Iterative Reactive Adaptive (HIRA) method consists of two phases. In analysis phase, fundamental parameters which affect the electricity price are identified depending on market development. Obtained parameters are used as data inputs for price forecasting using a hybrid method. The HIRA model combines a statistical approach for large data set analysis and a similar day method with neural network tools. Similar days are examined using a statistical method which combines correlation significance, price volatility, and forecasting accuracy of the historical data. Data are collected based on their availability and electricity prices are forecasted in several iterations. All relevant data for price forecasting are collected, categorized, and arranged using simple indicators which makes the HIRA model adaptive and reactive to new market circumstances. The proposed model is validated using the Hungarian Power Exchange (HUPX) electricity price data records. The results show that with HIRA model forecasting, the error is stable and does not depend on price volatility. The HIRA method has proven to be applicable for forecasting electricity prices in real-time market conditions and enables effective hedging of price risk in the production or market portfolio. © 2019 by the authors.",Data mining; Dynamic hybrid model; Electricity market; Electricity price; Neural network; Short-term electricity price forecast; Spot market,Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Electric utilities; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Competitive power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price volatilities; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Hybrid model; Spot market; Power markets,"4,5",1,1,1

Consequentially, challenges for profitability as well as correct management of the electricity sector have increased its complexity. The use of forecasting tools that allow a real and robust approach makes it possible to improve system operation and thus minimizing costs associated with the activities of the electric sector. Hence, the forecasting approaches have an essential role in all stages of the electricity markets. In this paper, a hybrid probabilistic forecasting model (HPFM) was developed for short-term electricity market prices (EMP), combining Wavelet Transform (WT), hybrid particle swarm optimization (DEEPSO), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), together with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS).

"Yang W., Wang J., Niu T., Du P.",A hybrid forecasting system based on a dual decomposition strategy and multi-objective optimization for electricity price forecasting,2019,Applied Energy,48,"Electricity price forecasting plays a crucial role in balancing electricity generation and consumption, which is of great political and economic significance for all of society but is still a challenging task. However, in previous studies, most researchers have focused on improving either forecasting accuracy or stability while ignoring the significance of performing these tasks simultaneously. More importantly, few researchers have deeply studied the data preprocessing strategy, only focusing on the application of individual decomposition approaches. Therefore, a novel hybrid forecasting system based on a dual decomposition strategy and multi-objective optimization is developed for electricity price forecasting that includes four modules: a data preprocessing module, optimization module, forecasting module and evaluation module. In this system, an effective multi-objective optimization algorithm is employed to guarantee simultaneous improvements in accuracy and stability. In addition, an improved data preprocessing approach named the dual decomposition strategy is developed, which successfully overcomes the potential drawback of the individual decomposition approach and further improves the effectiveness of the developed forecasting system. Moreover, the evaluation module is incorporated to verify the superiority of the developed forecasting system. Case studies utilizing half-hourly electricity price data collected from New South Wales, Australia are employed as examples. The results prove the superiority of the multi-objective optimization algorithm and the developed dual decomposition strategy and reveal that the developed forecasting system outperforms all of the considered comparison models, which shows its better ability to forecast future electricity prices with better accuracy and stability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Dual decomposition strategy; Electricity price forecasting system; Forecasting accuracy and stability; Multi-objective optimization algorithm,"Forecasting; Power markets; System stability; Decomposition approach; Dual decomposition; Electricity generation; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Multi-objective optimization algorithms; New South Wales , Australia; Optimization module; Multiobjective optimization; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data processing; decomposition analysis; electricity; electricity generation; forecasting method; optimization; price dynamics; Australia; New South Wales","4, 5",1,1,2
"de Marcos R.A., Bello A., Reneses J.",Electricity price forecasting in the short term hybridising fundamental and econometric modelling,2019,Electric Power Systems Research,8,"Traders and practitioners in diverse power exchanges are nowadays being most exposed to uncertainty than ever. The combination of several factors such as renewable generation and regulatory changes calls for suitable electricity price forecasting models that can deal with complex and unusual market conditions. Several authors have proposed combining fundamental approaches with econometric models in order to cover all relevant aspects for electricity price forecasting. This combination has shown positive results for medium-term horizons. However, this approach has rarely been carried out for short-term applications. Moreover, several day-to-day applications in electricity markets require fast responsiveness and accurate forecasts. All of these facts encourage this work's short-term hybrid electricity price forecasting model, which combines a cost-production optimisation (fundamental) model with an artificial neural network (econometric) model. In order to validate the advantages and contributions of the proposed model, it has been applied to a real-size power exchange with complex price dynamics, such as the Iberian electricity market.

"Wang F., Li K., Zhou L., Ren H., Contreras J., Shafie-khah M., Catalão J.P.S.",Daily pattern prediction based classification modeling approach for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2019,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,48,"Day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) plays a very important role in the decision-making optimization of electricity market participants, the dispatch control of independent system operators (ISOs) and the strategy formulation of energy trading. Unified modeling that only fits a single mapping relation between the historical data and future data usually produces larger errors because the different fluctuation patterns in electricity price data show different mapping relations. A daily pattern prediction (DPP) based classification modeling approach for DAEPF is proposed to solve this problem. The basic idea is that first recognize the price pattern of the next day from the “rough” day-ahead forecasting results provided by conventional forecasting methods and then perform classification modeling to further improve the forecasting accuracy through building a specific forecasting model for each pattern. The proposed approach consists of four steps. First, K-means is utilized to group all the historical daily electricity price curves into several clusters in order to assign each daily curve a pattern label for the training of the following daily pattern recognition (DPR) model and classification modeling. Second, a DPP model is proposed to recognize the price pattern of the next day from the forecasting results provided by multiple conventional forecasting methods. A weighted voting mechanism (WVM) method is proposed in this step to combine multiple day-ahead pattern predictions to obtain a more accurate DPP result. Third, the classification forecasting model of each different daily pattern can be established according to the clustering results in step 1. Fourth, the credibility of DPP result is checked to eventually determine whether the proposed classification DAEPF modeling approach can be adopted or not. A case study using the real electricity price data from the PJM market indicates that the proposed approach presents a better performance than unified modeling for a certain daily pattern whose DPP results show high reliability and accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Classification modeling; Daily pattern prediction; Day-ahead forecasting; Electricity price; Weighted voting mechanism,Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Decision making; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Mapping; Pattern recognition; Classification models; Day-ahead; Decision-making optimization; Different mapping relation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Independent system operators; Weighted voting; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1

Although various black-box modelling techniques have been applied to variations of this problem, we focus on the use of transparent models to enable understanding and interpretation of the developed model. We utilize a Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous input(NARMAX) for electricity price forecasting using multiple input factors. Energy data from a 14-week period in 2017 were analyzed to determine whether a NARMAX model could accurately predict day-ahead electricity prices and to check which input factors in the model were most significant. The model considered the closely correlated lags and included 13 input factors. There were two models developed in order to determine which variables played an important role in predicting future prices. Experimental results indicate that previous price, demand, gas, coal, and nuclear are the most significant factors that influence electricity prices. Gas was the highest weighted factor for both developed models. Previous price yielded the biggest Error Reduction Ratio(ERR), but when not included in the model, demand generated the biggest ERR value. To summarize a NARMAX model with an input regression lag of one and previous price included generates the best day-ahead forecast of electricity prices. © 2018 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Energy market; Multiple factors; NARMAX,Artificial intelligence; Composite structures; Costs; Forecasting; Black box modelling; Electricity price forecasting; Energy markets; Error reduction ratios; Forecasting algorithm; Multiple factors; NARMAX; Nonlinear autoregressive moving average models; Power markets,4,1,1,1

Here, we consider two novel extensions of this concept to probabilistic forecasting: one based on Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) applied to a set of point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows, the other on a technique dubbed Quantile Regression Machine (QRM), which first averages these point predictions, then applies quantile regression to the combined forecast. Once computed, we combine the probabilistic forecasts across calibration windows by averaging probabilities of the corresponding predictive distributions. Our results show that QRM is not only computationally more efficient, but also yields significantly more accurate distributional predictions, as measured by the aggregate pinball score and the test of conditional predictive ability. Moreover, combining probabilistic forecasts brings further significant accuracy gains. c 2019 by the authors.",Autoregression; Average probability forecast; Calibration window; Combining forecasts; Conditional predictive ability; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive distribution,Calibration; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Regression analysis; Autoregression; Combining forecasts; Electricity price forecasting; Pinball score; Predictive abilities; Predictive distributions; Probability forecasts; Power markets,4,2,1,2

Most existing papers predict price and load separately, while, the aggregate reaction of consumers can potentially shift the demand curve in the market, resulting in prices that may differ from the initial forecasts. In this regards, demand-side management (DSM) constructs the customers responsible for improving the efficiency, reliability and sustainability of the power system. In this paper, we proposed a new multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system which can consider the interaction between load and price. Therefore, proposed Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) to model the nonlinear pattern in price and load. Also, used discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to make valuable subsets. Moreover, proposed feature selection to select best input candidates. Finally, the MIMO-based LSSVM parameters are optimized by artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm.

"Karabiber O.A., Xydis G.","Electricity price forecasting in the Danish day-ahead market using the TBATS, ANN and ARIMA methods",2019,Energies,11,"In this paper day-ahead electricity price forecasting for the Denmark-West region is realized with a 24 h forecasting range. The forecasting is done for 212 days from the beginning of 2017 and past data from 2016 is used. For forecasting, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Trigonometric Seasonal Box-Cox Transformation with ARMA residuals Trend and Seasonal Components (TBATS) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods are used and seasonal naïve forecast is utilized as a benchmark. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are used as accuracy criterions. ARIMA and ANN are utilized with external variables and variable analysis is realized in order to improve forecasting results. As a result of variable analysis, it was observed that excluding temperature from external variables helped improve forecasting results. In terms of mean error ARIMA yielded the best results while ANN had the lowest minimum error and standard deviation. TBATS performed better than ANN in terms of mean error. To further improve forecasting accuracy, the three forecasts were combined using simple averaging and ANN methods and they were both found to be beneficial, with simple averaging having better accuracy. Overall, this paper demonstrates a solid forecasting methodology, while showing actual forecasting results and improvements for different forecasting methods. © 2019 by the authors.",ARIMA; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combination; Neural network,Commerce; Errors; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; ARIMA; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Box Cox transformation; Day ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Forecast combinations; Forecasting accuracy; Root mean squared errors; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1
"Xiong H., Mamon R.",A higher-order Markov chain-modulated model for electricity spot-price dynamics,2019,Applied Energy,6,"Over the last three decades, the electricity sector worldwide underwent massive deregulation. Power market participants have encountered a growing number of challenges due to competition and other pertinent factors. For most markets at present, electricity is a non-storable commodity and its price is extremely sensitive to changes in supply and demand. The evolution of electricity prices exhibits pronounced mean reversion and cyclical patterns, possesses extreme volatility and relatively frequently occurring spikes, and manifests presence of memory property. These observed features necessitate the development of models aimed to simultaneously capture such price characteristics for forecasting, risk management, and valuation of electricity-driven derivatives. Majority of current research studies examining electricity spot prices are based on one-state models. Such models though may not accurately capture the stylised behaviours of price evolution, especially during periods of sudden spikes driven by the abrupt changes of market sentiments. This paper tackles the modelling and estimation problems under a new paradigm that integrates the deterministic calendar seasons and stochastic factors governing electricity prices with a regime-switching feature. The de-seasonalised component of our proposed model has both the jump and mean-reverting properties to account for spikes and periodic cycles alternating between lower price returns and compensating periods of higher price returns. The parameters of the de-seasonalised model components are also modulated by a higher-order hidden Markov chain (HOHMC) in discrete time. This provides a mechanism to extract latent information from historical data. The HOHMC's state is interpreted as the “state of the world” resulting from the interaction of various forces impacting the electricity market. Filters are developed to generate optimal estimates of HOHMC-relevant quantities using the observation process, and these provide online estimates of model parameters. Empirical demonstrations using the daily electricity spot prices, compiled by the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO), show that our HOHMM approach has considerable merits in terms of price data fitting and forecasting metrics. Our proposed framework driven by a hidden Markov chain with a state memory-capturing mechanism provides a powerful alternative to support the pricing of contracts in the electricity markets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Change of reference probability measure; Commodity-derivatives valuation; Energy-price modelling; Finance; Poisson process; Statistical estimation,Chains; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Finance; Markov processes; Risk management; Signal theory; Stochastic systems; Electricity spot price; Energy prices; Hidden Markov chains; Higher-order Markov chains; Market participants; Poisson process; Reference probability; Statistical estimation; Power markets; demand analysis; electricity; energy market; estimation method; financial system; Markov chain; numerical model; Poisson ratio; price dynamics; probability; statistical analysis; stochasticity; Alberta; Canada,"3, 4",1,1,1

A Gaussian Kernel Density Estimator function is used for each input variable, which allows to calculate the parameters of the probability density function (PDF) of a Beta distribution for the hourly price variable. Thus, valuable information is obtained from PDFs such as point forecasts, variance values, quantiles, probabilities of prices, and time series representations of forecast uncertainty. A Reliability Indicator is also introduced to give a measure of “reliability” of forecasts.

Price classification is an alternative approach to forecasting where the exact values of future prices are not mandatory. Presently, two efficient algorithms are proposed for both short term price forecasting (STPF) and classification (STPC) purposes. The algorithms include various methodologies like wavelet transform (WT), fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization (FA-PSO) and feed forward neural networks (FFNN). WT is utilized to convert the pathetic price series to an inviolable price series without losing the originality in the signal. Standard PSO (S-PSO) is implemented to tune the fixed architecture FFNN weights and biases. In the present nonlinear problem, linear variation of inertia weight does not resemble exact search process. Hence, dynamic inertia weight is accomplished by implementing the fuzzy systems in the S-PSO approach. The hybrid methodology is implemented on Spanish electricity markets for the year 2002. To validate, three types of price classes and historical price series that are utilized by many researches as input features, are considered.

The bivariate distribution results in more profitable offers based on the conditional probability of wind power forecasting errors with respect to the RT price forecasting errors. The standard deviation of the bivariate distribution is reduced through a novel probabilistic wind power forecasting algorithm based on a parametric approach to further increase the profitability of the offer curve. In conclusion, the test of the advanced offer curve on the data sampled from the Iberian peninsula shows that the offer curve of the bivariate distribution has a higher profitability than offer curves of the marginal distribution. © 2018 IEEE.",correlation structure; offer curve; Probabilistic wind power forecasting; skewed student-T distribution,Correlation methods; Costs; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Errors; Forecasting; Probabilistic logics; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Profitability; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Correlation structure; Offer Curve; Probabilistic wind power forecasting; Skewed Student-t; Wind forecasting; Power markets,4,1,1,2

The advent of smart grids is escalating the importance of forecasting because of the expected ubiquitous monitoring and growing complexity of a data-rich ever-changing milieu. So, the increasing data volatility will require forecasting tools able to rapidly readjust to a dynamic environment. The Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) approach is a solution that has recently re-emerged, emphasizing good performance, fast run-times and ease of parameterization. The merging of this model with more conventional methods allows us to obtain more sturdy solutions with shortened training times, when compared to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Overall, the performance of the GRNN, although slightly inferior to that of the ANN, is suitable, but linked to much lower training times. Ultimately, the GRNN would be a proper solution to blend with the latest smart grids features, which may require much reduced forecasting training times. © 2018 IEEE.",Data sampling; electricity prices forecasting; load forecasting; neural networks; performance evaluation,Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Smart power grids; Conventional methods; Data sampling; Dynamic environments; Electricity prices forecasting; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Generalized regression neural networks; Load forecasting; Performance evaluations; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1

These challenges are accompanied by an increasing uncertainty about future electricity price movements. The increasing amount of papers, which aim to model and predict electricity prices for a short period of time provided new opportunities for market participants. However, the electricity price literature seem to be very scarce on the issue of medium- to long-term price forecasting, which is mandatory for investment and political decisions. Our paper closes this gap by introducing a new approach to simulate electricity prices with hourly resolution for several months up to three years. Considering the uncertainty of future events we are able to provide probabilistic forecasts which are able to detect probabilities for price spikes even in the long-run. As market we decided to use the EPEX day-ahead electricity market for Germany and Austria. Our model extends the X-Model which mainly utilizes the sale and purchase curve for electricity day-ahead auctions. By applying our procedure we are able to give probabilities for the due to the EEG practical relevant event of six consecutive hours of negative prices. We find that using the supply and demand curve based model in the long-run yields realistic patterns for the time series of electricity prices and leads to promising results considering common error measures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity prices; Long-term; Negative prices; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energy; Supply and demand,Commerce; Costs; Curve fitting; Decision making; Forecasting; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Electricity prices; Long-term; Negative prices; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energies; Supply and demand; Power markets,"2, 4","2, 3",1,2

Electricity price time series exhibit variable means, significant volatility and spikes, which places high demands on forecasting models. Moreover, in recent years researchers and practitioners have come to understand the limitations of point forecasts and require models to generate probabilistic forecasts. In contrast to point forecasts, the probabilistic forecasts takes the form of a predictive probability distribution over future quantities or events of interest. In the paper the probabilistic forecasting model based on Nadaraya- Watson estimator is proposed. The model generates the point forecasts as 24-component vectors representing day-ahead electricity prices.

"Chen Y., Li M., Yang Y., Li C., Li Y., Li L.",A hybrid model for electricity price forecasting based on least square support vector machines with combined kernel,2018,Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy,3,"With the continuous development of the global electricity market, the electricity market needs the electricity price forecasting result to be accurate, and electricity price forecasting also has more profound practical significance. Accurate price forecasting can not only better reflect the operation of the electricity market but also help to make better decisions about the electricity market. However, the electricity price is affected by a variety of uncertain subjective and objective factors, as well as the constraints of the power system, making it more difficult to obtain accurate electricity price forecasting than electricity load forecasting. The kernel function occupies a very important position in a support vector machine (SVM), which is the key to the mature development of SVM theory. When using SVM for classification and regression, the appropriate kernel function is the basis and precondition for obtaining better classification and approximation effects. In this paper, a new combinatorial kernel function that combines RBF and UKF kernel functions is proposed and is applied to a least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and based on this, a new hybrid model empirical mode (EMD)-Mixed-LSSVM is proposed to forecast electricity price. The hybrid model puts the electricity price data after the noise reduction by the EMD into the LSSVM with the combined kernel function for calculation. In this paper, we forecast the electricity price in Australia and compare the results of EMD-Mixed-LSSVM with other methods. The results show that EMD-Mixed-LSSVM can effectively improve the accuracy of electricity price forecasting. © 2018 Author(s).",,Commerce; Electric industry; Electric machine theory; Forecasting; Noise abatement; Support vector machines; Approximation effects; Combined kernel function; Continuous development; Electricity load forecasting; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Least square support vector machines; Least squares support vector machines; Power markets,5,0,1,0

The electricity framework takes into account the power system balancing constraints required to ensure its reliability and security. This complex structure with its aim of competitiveness motivated the participating entities to run the generating capacities at the optimum level, forced the operators to minimize the transmission losses and created an environment for the consumers to take the benefit of variable pricing conditions. Specially, these effects are reflected via short term electricity price forecasting (STPF) in a significant amount. The STPF created the required decision base for the entities to bid in market with an effective strategy of risk management to hedge against the highly volatile pricing events to ensure the required amount of liquidity and making better economic conditions while in case of large consumers, it helps to either curtail or schedule the loads to minimize the cost of energy. It also helps them to prepare an alternative strategy to make available the required energy via small private generating units during peak price hours. To account for different requirements of various entities, accurate price forecasting is a crucial task. The complexity of the price dynamics also involves the variations attributed to spatial effects in different operating regions such as calamities and extreme conditions.

"Vilar J., Aneiros G., Raña P.",Prediction intervals for electricity demand and price using functional data,2018,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,7,"This paper provides two procedures to obtain prediction intervals for electricity demand and price based on functional data. The proposed procedures are related to one day ahead pointwise forecast. In particular, the first method uses a nonparametric autoregressive model and the second one uses a partial linear semi-parametric model, in which exogenous scalar covariates are incorporated in a linear way. In both cases, the proposed procedures for the construction of the prediction intervals use residual-based bootstrap algorithms, which allows also to obtain estimates of the prediction density. Applications to the Spanish Electricity Market, in year 2012, are reported. This work extends and complements the results of Aneiros et al.

These extreme observations may significantly impact the obtained model estimates and hence reduce efficiency of the employed predictive algorithms. For markets with only positive prices, the logarithmic transform is the single most commonly used technique to reduce spike severity and consequently stabilize the variance. However, for datasets with very close to zero (like the Spanish) or negative (like the German) prices the log-transform is not feasible. What reasonable choices do we have then? To address this issue, we evaluate 16 variance stabilizing transformations within a comprehensive forecasting study involving two model classes (regression models, neural networks) and 12 datasets from diverse power markets.

Automated negotiation plays a crucial role in the decision support for energy transactions due to the constant need for players to engage in bilateral negotiations. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate bilateral contract prices, which is essential to support market players in their decisions, enabling adequate risk management of the negotiation process. The proposed approach uses an adaptation of the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm to choose the best from a set of possible contract prices forecasts that are determined using several methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), among others. The learning process assesses the probability of success of each forecasting method, by comparing the expected negotiation price with the historic data contracts of competitor players. The negotiation scenario identified as the most probable scenario that the player will face during the negotiation process is the one that presents the higher expected utility value.

First, we propose a deep neural network that considers features from connected markets to improve the predictive accuracy in a local market. To measure the importance of these features, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm that, by using Bayesian optimization and functional analysis of variance, evaluates the effect of the features on the algorithm performance. In addition, using market integration, we propose a second model that, by simultaneously predicting prices from two markets, improves the forecasting accuracy even further. As a case study, we consider the electricity market in Belgium and the improvements in forecasting accuracy when using various French electricity features. We show that the two proposed models lead to improvements that are statistically significant. Particularly, due to market integration, the predictive accuracy is improved from 15.7% to 12.5% sMAPE (symmetric mean absolute percentage error).

Especially as the electricity market is becomes more competitive, a more accurate price prediction than the day-ahead locational marginal price (DALMP) published by the independent system operator (ISO) will benefit participants in the market by increasing profit or improving load demand scheduling. Hence, the main idea of this paper is to use autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to obtain a better LMP prediction than the DALMP by utilizing the published DALMP, historical real-time LMP (RTLMP) and other useful information. First, a set of seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models utilizing the DALMP and historical RTLMP are developed and compared with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models that use the differences between DALMP and RTLMP on their forecasting capability. A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is implemented to further improve the forecasting by accounting for the price volatility. The models are trained and evaluated using real market data in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region. The evaluation results indicate that the ARMAX-GARCH model, where an exogenous time series indicates weekend days, improves the short-term electricity price prediction accuracy and outperforms the other proposed ARIMA models. © 2017 IEEE.",ARIMA models; Electricity market; Locational marginal price; Price prediction,Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Scheduling; ARIMA models; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Autoregressive moving average model; Electricity price forecasting; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Independent system operators; Locational marginal prices; Price prediction; Power markets,4,1,1,1

It is the basis for decision-making in the electricity market. With the continuous development of global power marketization, the role of electricity price in the electricity market has received increasing attention. Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting can provide guidance for bidding strategies of market participants, thereby reducing bidding risks of participants and providing them with a stable return. However, due to the complex nature of electricity prices such as high volatility, high frequency, nonlinearity and non-stationarity, it is difficult to accurately predict electricity prices in advance. To improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a market clearing prices (MCPs) prediction method based on wavelet transforms (WT) and stacked autoencoders (SAEs). The deep learning framework comprises two stages is introduced in this work. First, WT is employed to decompose raw MCPs data into different frequency series for better behaviors. Second, the nonlinear features and invariant structures of each frequency are completely extracted by layer-wise pre-training based SAEs. The effectiveness of the proposed prediction method is verified by using actual price data from the Australian electricity market.

Power Grid Corporation (ISO), Indian Energy Exchange (ISO) & Kerala State Electricity Board (RTO) are the key players who perform this function for Kerala region. IEX manage the energy markets by operating three submarkets day-ahead, real-time& capacity markets. Through day-ahead market, electricity generators &load-serving entities submit their bids to receive & offer electricity to the power grid based on varying cost on each hour for the next operating day. In the real-time market, ISO & RTOs manage these changes in production & consumption throughout the day. They optimize the generation dispatch schedule where they consider generation cost & transmission constraints. Capacity markets are employed to have study flow of capital investments in the market thereby increasing the generation capacity. Currently, KSEB forecast & schedule power generation to ensure sufficient power is available at its disposal for transmission. But with generation capacity standing at a mere 30% of demand, it has to depend upon bulk purchases.

The best twenty predictors of the EEM2016 EPF competition are used to create ensembles of hourly spot price forecasts. For each hour, the parameter values of the probability density function (PDF) of a Beta distribution for the output variable (hourly price) can be directly obtained from the expected and variance values associated to the ensemble for such hour, using three aggregation strategies of predictor forecasts corresponding to three PPFMCP models. A Reliability Indicator (RI) and a Loss function Indicator (LI) are also introduced to give a measure of uncertainty of probabilistic price forecasts. The three PPFMCP models were satisfactorily applied to the real-world case study of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). Results from PPFMCP models showed that PPFMCP model 2, which uses aggregation by weight values according to daily ranks of predictors, was the best probabilistic meta-model from a point of view of mean absolute errors, as well as of RI and LI. PPFMCP model 1, which uses the averaging of predictor forecasts, was the second best meta-model. PPFMCP models allow evaluations of risk decisions based on the price to be made. © 2018 by the authors.

This energy market is liberalized and complex due the new and modified rules along time. Due these circumstances the hourly energy prices may vary tremendously. The goal of this work is to analyze in detail the generation technologies, their strategies and energy mix to gain awareness and knowledge to evaluate energy price fluctuations. Two methods are used to forecast in different time horizons: ARIMAX and NARX. Both methods are homologous, using historical energy prices and optionally an explanatory variable. Three options are studied: No explanatory, energy demand and competitive market. Once the models are developed and trained, the results achieved are helpful to understand further changes in the market.

These processes are commonly found in electricity markets and are gaining more importance as more market data become available and markets head toward continuous-time marginal pricing approaches. Forecasting these time series requires models that operate with continuous functions. This paper proposes a new functional forecasting method that attempts to generalize the standard seasonal ARMAX time series model to the L2 Hilbert space. The structure of the proposed model is a linear regression where functional parameters operate on functional variables. The variables can be lagged values of the series (autoregressive terms), past observed innovations (moving average terms), or exogenous variables. In this approach, the functional parameters used are integral operators whose kernels are modeled as linear combinations of sigmoid functions. The parameters of each sigmoid are optimized using a Quasi-Newton algorithm that minimizes the sum of squared errors. This novel approach allows us to estimate the moving average terms in functional time series models. The new model is tested by forecasting the daily price profile of the Spanish and German electricity markets and it is compared to other functional reference models. © 2017 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; Functional ARMAX model; Functional data analysis; Functional time series,Commerce; Continuous time systems; Costs; Forecasting; Functions; Power markets; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Time series; ARMAX model; Electricity price forecasting; Functional data analysis; Functional forecasting; Functional parameters; Functional time series; Quasi-newton algorithm; Sum of squared errors; Time series analysis,4,1,1,1

Once sellers and buyers access an accurate price forecasting, managing the economic risk can be conducted appropriately through offering or bidding suitable prices. In networks with high wind power penetration, the electricity price is influenced by wind energy; therefore, price forecasting can be more complicated. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for price forecasting of day-ahead markets, with high penetration of wind generators based on Wavelet transform, bivariate Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN). To this end, a weighted time series for wind dominated power systems is calculated and added to a bivariate ARIMA model along with the price time series. Moreover, RBFN is applied as a tool to correct the estimation error, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the structure and adapt the RBFN to the particular training set. This method is evaluated on the Spanish electricity market, which shows the efficiency of this approach.

In particular, periods with low and high price levels are difficult to predict due to a limited number of representative cases in the historical dataset, which leads to forecast bias problems and wide forecast intervals. Moreover, these markets also require the inclusion of multiple explanatory variables, which increases the complexity of the model without guaranteeing a forecasting skill improvement. This paper explores information from daily futures contract trading and forecast of the daily average spot price to correct point and probabilistic forecasting bias. It also shows that an adequate choice of explanatory variables and use of simple models like linear quantile regression can lead to highly accurate spot price point and probabilistic forecasts. In terms of point forecast, the mean absolute error was 3.03 €/MWh for day-ahead market and a maximum value of 2.53 €/MWh was obtained for intraday session 6.

In this paper we propose a regime-switching AR–GARCH copula to model pairs of day-ahead electricity prices in coupled European markets. While capturing key stylized facts empirically substantiated in the literature, this model easily allows us to 1) deviate from the assumption of normal margins and 2) include a more detailed description of the dependence between prices. We base our empirical study on four pairs of prices, namely Germany–France, Germany–Netherlands, Netherlands–Belgium and Germany–Western Denmark. We find that the marginal dynamics are better described by the flexible skew t distribution than the benchmark normal distribution. Also, we find significant evidence of tail dependence in all pairs of interconnected areas we consider. As a first application of the proposed model, we consider the pricing of financial transmission rights, and highlight how the choice of marginal distributions and copula impacts prices. As a second application we consider the forecasting of tail quantiles, and evaluate the out-of-sample performance of competing models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Copula models; Day-ahead electricity prices; Financial transmission rights; Market coupling; Tail dependence; Tail quantile forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Normal distribution; Copula models; Electricity prices; Financial transmission right; Market coupling; Tail dependence; Power markets; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; modeling; performance assessment; price dynamics; Belgium; Denmark; France; Germany; Netherlands,"3, 4",1,1,1
"Guo W., Zhao Z.",A novel hybrid BND-FOA-LSSVM model for electricity price forecasting,2017,Information (Switzerland),6,"Accurate electricity price forecasting plays an important role in the profits of electricity market participants and the healthy development of electricity market. However, the electricity price time series hold the characteristics of volatility and randomness, which make it quite hard to forecast electricity price accurately. In this paper, a novel hybrid model for electricity price forecasting was proposed combining Beveridge-Nelson decomposition (BND) method, fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) model, namely BND-FOA-LSSVM model. Firstly, the original electricity price time series were decomposed into deterministic term, periodic term, and stochastic term by using BND model. Then, these three decomposed terms were forecasted by employing LSSVM model, respectively. Meanwhile, to improve the forecasting performance, a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm FOA was used to automatically determine the optimal parameters of LSSVM model for deterministic term forecasting, periodic term forecasting, and stochastic term forecasting. Finally, the forecasting result of electricity price can be obtained by multiplying the forecasting values of these three terms. The results show the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the proposed BND-FOA-LSSVM model are respectively 3.48%, 11.18 Yuan/MWh and 9.95 Yuan/MWh, which are much smaller than that of LSSVM, BND-LSSVM, FOA-LSSVM, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-FOA-LSSVM models.

"Saâdaoui F., Mrad M.",Stochastic modelling of the price-volume relationship in electricity markets: Evidence from the Nordic energy exchange,2017,International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems,1,"The analysis of the interactions between price and transaction volume, conducted as part of a financial market, is one of the central themes of the financial theory. However, with the emergence of power exchanges and despite the expansion of the research sphere in this context, this issue had not been sufficiently addressed. This is due to not only the lack of concepts in theory but also to the peculiarity of price dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the nature of the relationship between price changes and trading volume in the Nordic power market (Nord Pool), which is one of the largest energy markets worldwide. Through statistical timing analysis of the price-volume covariation, we reconsider this joint modelling, but only settling for daily observations, which makes the specificity of this work. Contrary to most comparable works, which were based on high frequency data, we chose to omit intraday observations to circumvent the repercussion of the daily seasonality on one side and ensure more lucidity and clairvoyance to a wider horizon on the other. The empirical results go in line with our expectations and provide support for the claim that there exists a significant reciprocal causality between prices and trading volume.

The model consists of an objective function describing the minimum difference between real price for current hour and forecasted price for the same hour. It is constrained by four equations describing current demand, supply, price and also its forecasted values. The whole system comprised of dynamic discrete model of which fundamentals are described by the author in the previous paper. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated with real data from the Californian ISO day-ahead energy market. The proposed method provides significant innovation in area of price - forecasting tools and is characterized as new approach compared to most popular techniques applied to energy markets. © 2017 IEEE.",Day-ahead electricity market; Dynamic discrete model; Optimization; Price forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Optimization; Day-ahead electricity market; Day-ahead energy markets; Discrete dynamic models; Discrete modeling; Electricity price forecasting; Price forecasting; Transmission congestion; Wholesale energy market; Power markets,"2, 4",1,1,1

There are numerous methods that efficiently support the forecasting of time series, such as electricity prices, which have high volatility. However, the performance of these approaches varies depending on data sets and operational conditions. In this work, the concept of composite forecasting is presented and implemented in a retrospective study, in real industrial forecasting conditions to show the potential of forecast performance improvement and comparable high consistency of a forecast performance across different ‘Day Peak’ and ‘Day Base’ electricity price data sets for different seasons. As individual methods support vector regression, artificial neural networks and ridge regression are implemented. The forecast performances of these methods are evaluated and compared with their forecast combination using different error measures. The results show that composite forecasting processes with ‘inverse root mean squared error’ combination approach can generate, on average, a more accurate and robust forecast than using an individual methods or other combination schemas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Combined forecast; Computational intelligence; Energy; Forecasting; Modelling,Artificial intelligence; Costs; Forecasting; Inverse problems; Models; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Combination approaches; Combined forecasts; Electricity price forecasting; Energy; Industrial forecasting; Operational conditions; Root mean squared errors; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets; data set; electricity supply; energy use; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; price dynamics; regression analysis,5,0,1,0
"Peter S.E., Raglend I.J.",Sequential wavelet-ANN with embedded ANN-PSO hybrid electricity price forecasting model for Indian energy exchange,2017,Neural Computing and Applications,8,"This research paper presents a novel sequential wavelet-artificial neural network (ANN) with embedded ANN-particle swarm optimization (PSO) for short-term day-ahead forecasting of market clearing price (MCP) in the Indian energy exchange. A precise price forecasting helps suppliers to set up bidding strategies, make investment decisions and be cautious against risks. Conversely, consumers can use price forecasting to exploit appropriate power purchasing strategies for maximum utility utilization. Here the most influential historical data, namely purchase bid and MCP, are considered for training the feed-forward back-propagation neural network. The proposed model involves three sequential phases. Initially, the raw historical data are smoothened by removing the high-frequency components using a wavelet transform method which may enable better training of neural network. Then, ANN is used to train historical patterns. More number of trials is carried out, and the final weights that give the least training error are stored. In the final phase, the stored weights that are obtained from various trials are used as the initial population for the embedded ANN-PSO model. Here the performance of the proposed forecasting model is carried out using three error indices, namely mean absolute percentage error, normalized mean square error and error variance. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Artificial neural networks; Mean absolute percentage error; Particle swarm optimization; Wavelet transform,Backpropagation; Costs; Errors; Forecasting; Investments; Mean square error; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Wavelet transforms; Electricity price forecasting; Feed-forward back-propagation neural networks; Forecasting modeling; High frequency components; Investment decisions; Market clearing prices; Mean absolute percentage error; Normalized mean square error; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1

These in turn can benefit from the inclusion of a reliable forecast of short term system marginal prices (SMPs). In a market with an increasing percentage of renewable generators, reliable forecasts must necessarily consider additional factors such as meteorological forecasts, forecasted demand and constraints imposed by network topology. Traditional time series forecasting algorithms (e.g. based on AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models) can perform reasonably well in this context but rely on assumptions being made on behavior over different temporal windows to yield consistent results. Research studies have demonstrated that an adaptive or self-adaptive approach to forecasting would appear more suited to the task of predicting energy demands in territory such as Ireland. Implementing an in-house self-adaptive model should yield good results in the dynamic uncertain Irish energy market.

Additionally it describes well the autoregressive and seasonal effects of intraday electricity prices such as the relationship to day-ahead electricity prices. The methodology is applied to the German intraday market and includes the dependence of the German/Austrian EPEX and EXAA day-ahead markets. Moreover, we discuss the evidence of time-varying and asymmetric effects of wind and solar power forecasting errors.

A stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA) model, a class of deep neural networks, and its extended version are utilized to forecast the electricity price hourly. Data collected in Nebraska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Indiana hubs in U.S. are utilized. Two types of forecasting, the online hourly forecasting and day-ahead hourly forecasting, are examined. In online forecasting, SDA models are compared with data-driven approaches including the classical neural networks, support vector machine, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. In the day-ahead forecasting, the effectiveness of SDA models is further validated through comparing with industrial results and a recently reported method. Computational results demonstrate that SDA models are capable to accurately forecast electricity prices and the extended SDA model further improves the forecasting performance. © 2016 IEEE.",Comparative analysis; data mining; electricity price; hourly forecasting; neural networks,Costs; Data mining; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Neural networks; Power markets; Classical neural networks; Comparative analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting performance; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Short-term forecasting; Forecasting,5,1,1,1

This provides forward planning of their bidding strategies in order to maximise revenue, profit, and utility perspectives. Nevertheless, due to the non-stationarities involved in market clearing price, an accurate forecasting of these prices is very complex. In this case, transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval ones is of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts. In this study, interval forecasting of market clearing prices is conducted based on a novel approach within two consecutive steps. In the first step, a new hybrid method is proposed to estimate point forecasts: combination of wavelet transformation (Wt), feature selection based on Mutual Information (MI), extreme learning machine (ELM), and bootstrap approaches in an ensemble structure is employed. The second step consists of the following stepwise parts: calculating the variance of the model uncertainties based on the extracted data from the ensemble structure, estimating the noise variance by using the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), and improving the accuracy of interval forecasting by using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach termed as Wt-mutual information-ELM-MLE-PSO is validated through electricity market real data of Australian electricity network from real-time and day-ahead market viewpoints. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Electric industry; Learning algorithms; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Uncertainty analysis; Australian electricities; Extreme learning machine; Interval forecasting; Market Clearing Price; Model uncertainties; Mutual informations; Particle swarm optimisation; Wavelet transformations; Forecasting,5,1,1,2

Day-ahead prediction provides forecast prices for a day ahead that is useful for daily operation and decision-making. The main challenge for day ahead price forecasting is the accuracy and efficiency. Lower accuracy is produced due to the nature of electricity price that is highly volatile compared to load series. Hence, some researchers have developed complex procedures to produce accurate forecast while considering significant features and optimum parameters. Therefore, a multistage optimization for hybrid Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model is developed in this study to provide an accurate price forecast with optimized parameters and input features. So far, no literature has been found on multistage feature and parameter selections using the methods of LSSVM-GA for day-ahead price prediction. All the models are examined on the Ontario power market; which is reported as among the most volatile market worldwide.

"Kiesel R., Paraschiv F.",Econometric analysis of 15-minute intraday electricity prices,2017,Energy Economics,56,"The trading activity in the German intraday electricity market has increased significantly over the last years. This is partially due to an increasing share of renewable energy, wind and photovoltaic, which requires power generators to balance out the forecasting errors in their production. We investigate the bidding behaviour in the intraday market by looking at both last prices and continuous bidding, in the context of a reduced-form econometric analysis. A unique data set of 15-minute intraday prices and intraday-updated forecasts of wind and photovoltaic has been employed. Price bids are explained by prior information on renewables forecasts and demand/supply market-specific exogenous variables. We show that intraday prices adjust asymmetrically to both forecasting errors in renewables and to the volume of trades dependent on the threshold variable demand quote, which reflects the expected demand covered by the planned traditional capacity in the day-ahead market. The location of the threshold can be used by market participants to adjust their bids accordingly, given the latest updates in the wind and photovoltaic forecasting errors and the forecasts of the control area balances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bidding behavior; Intraday electricity prices; Renewable energies,Commerce; Costs; Errors; Bidding behavior; Demand/supply market; Econometric analysis; Electricity prices; Exogenous variables; Market participants; Prior information; Renewable energies; Forecasting; alternative energy; econometrics; electricity supply; photovoltaic system; price determination; wind power; Germany,3,1,2,1

From the perspective of demand-side management (DSM), electricity prices prediction can be regarded as a pattern recognition problem of classifying future electricity prices with respect to a predefined threshold. From a fresh perspective this paper develops an efficient framework, called TSS-RFE-MRMR based SVM (Time series segmentation, recursive feature elimination, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance based support vector machine), for providing estimates of price fluctuation over certain valuation domains and modeling high-dimensional electricity market price without adopting additional impact factors. It starts from adopting a novel feature space determination scheme, called principal component analysis-dynamic programming (PCA-DP) based time series segmentation. Then, the RFE-MRMR filter for significant features selection is implemented, where both redundant and less relevant features are progressively eliminated among the potential feature sets.

Saâdaoui F.,A seasonal feedforward neural network to forecast electricity prices,2017,Neural Computing and Applications,15,"In power industry and management, given the peculiarity and high complexity of the time series, it is highly requested to make models more flexible and well adapted to the data, in order to give them the ability to capture and recognize the most complex patterns, and consequently gain more accuracy in forecasting. To fulfill this aim, we define the seasonal autoregressive neural network (SAR-NN) as a dynamic feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), essentially conceived to forecast electricity prices. The SAR-NN is an ANN-based autoregressive model that considers that autoregressors are only those that are lagged by a multiple of the period p of the dominating seasonality. Moving forward this neural network, step-by-step, allows to generate multiple-steps-ahead reliable forecasts. This model is specifically designed to robustly overcome the strong seasonal effects and the other nonlinear patterns that often harm ANNs forecasting performance.

Bennedsen M.,A rough multi-factor model of electricity spot prices,2017,Energy Economics,7,"We introduce a new continuous-time mathematical model of electricity spot prices which accounts for the most important stylized facts of these time series: seasonality, spikes, stochastic volatility, and mean reversion. Empirical studies have found a possible fifth stylized fact, roughness, and our approach explicitly incorporates this into the model of the prices. Our setup generalizes the popular Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-based multi-factor framework of Benth et al. (2007) and allows us to perform statistical tests to distinguish between an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-based model and a rough model. Further, through the multi-factor approach we account for seasonality and spikes before estimating – and making inference on – the degree of roughness. This is novel in the literature and we present simulation evidence showing that these precautions are crucial for accurate estimation. Lastly, we estimate our model on recent data from six European energy exchanges and find statistical evidence of roughness in five out of six markets. As an application of our model, we show how, in these five markets, a rough component improves short term forecasting of the prices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity prices; Energy markets; Forecasting; Fractals; Mean reversion; Multi-factor modeling; Roughness,Commerce; Continuous time systems; Costs; Estimation; Forecasting; Fractals; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Surface roughness; Electricity prices; Electricity spot price; Energy markets; European energy exchanges; Mean reversion; Multi factors; Short-term forecasting; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic models; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; fractal analysis; numerical model; price determination; Europe,4,1,1,1

Occurrence of spikes in real time LBMP is due to uncertainty in load demand as well as a significant variation in surrounding temperature throughout the day. These fluctuations cause extreme spikes in market clearing price due to transmission outages, shortage of supply and consumption of costly generation reserves. Therefore, the market participants are forced to purchase the electricity at very high price but the regulation set on the price cap by market authorities results into an economic loss to retailers and market participants.

"Nair I., Robert A.",A chaotic model approach for electricity price forecasting in Indian scenario,2017,,,"In a deregulated power market, the electricity prices exhibit extreme volatility due to its non-storable nature, supply constraints at peak hours, transmission line congestion at peak hours and seasonal and diurnal variations. The objective of this paper is to model the day-ahead market price of Indian energy exchange (IEX) based on time series modelling approach. The detailed analysis of market clearing price (MCP) collected from IEX clearly indicates the chaotic nature of data. It is because of this chaotic behaviour, the phase space of the time series data is reconstructed using Taken's theorem. With the concept of the add-weighted one-rank multi-step model, the MCP of IEX is modelled as a chaotic model from this reconstructed phase space. Furthermore, the developed chaotic model is verified for forecasting MCP and the simulation results demonstrate that the chaotic model developed outperforms the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model in terms of in sample forecasting performances.

"Itaba S., Mori H.",A Fuzzy-Preconditioned GRBFN Model for Electricity Price Forecasting,2017,Procedia Computer Science,5,"This paper proposes a fuzzy-preconditioned ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model for electricity price forecasting. The deregulated electric power systems have been widely spread to trade electric power through electric power markets. The market players are interested in gaining the inside track to maximize the profits and minimize risks in advance. One of the most important tasks is how to forecast a complicated time series of electricity price that affects transmission network congestion. In practice, it is hard to forecast electricity price with the spikes due to the high nonlinearity. In this paper, GRBFN (General Radial Basis Function Network) of ANN is proposed for electricity price forecasting. It is an extension of RBFN of ANN in a way that the optimal parameters of the Gaussian functions are determined by the learning process in RBFN. To improve the model accuracy of GRBFN, FCE (fuzzy c-Elliptotypes) is introduced into GRBFN as a fuzzy precondition technique. FCE is an extension of FCM (fuzzy c-means) and plays a key role to classify input data into fuzzy clusters. The use of FCE contributes to the improvement of model accuracy for spikes of electricity price that bring about much higher price. This paper makes use of DA clustering to evaluate a better initial solution of the parameters of the Gaussian functions. Also, EPSO of evolutionary computation is used to evaluate better weights between neurons.

"Wolff G., Feuerriegel S.",Short-term dynamics of day-ahead and intraday electricity prices,2017,International Journal of Energy Sector Management,6,"Purpose: Since the liberalization of electricity markets in the European Union, prices are subject to market dynamics. Hence, understanding the short-term drivers of electricity prices is of major interest to electricity companies and policymakers. Accordingly, this paper aims to study movements of prices in the combined German and Austrian electricity market. Design/methodology/approach: This paper estimates an autoregressive model with exogenous variables (ARX) in a two-step procedure. In the first step, both time series, which inherently feature seasonality, are de-seasonalized, and in the second step, the influence of all model variables on the two dependent variables, i.e. the day-ahead and intraday European Power Energy Exchange prices, is measured. Findings: The results reveal that the short-term market is largely driven by seasonality, consumer demand and short-term feed-ins from renewable energy sources. As a contribution to the existing body of literature, this paper specifically compares the price movements in day-ahead and intraday markets. In intraday markets, the influences of renewable energies are much stronger than in day-ahead markets, i.e. by 24.12 per cent for wind and 116.82 per cent for solar infeeds. Originality/value: Knowledge on the price setting mechanism in the intraday market is particularly scarce. This paper contributes to existing research on this topic by deriving drivers in the intraday market and then contrasting them to the day-ahead market. A more thorough understanding is especially crucial for all stakeholders, who can use this knowledge to optimize their bidding strategies. Furthermore, the findings suggest policy implications for a more stable and efficient electricity market. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Autoregressive; Electricity; External drivers; Modelling; Pricing; Renewable energies; Time series analysis; Weather influence,Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric industry; Electricity; Models; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive model with exogenous variable (ARX); Dependent variables; Design/methodology/approach; Electricity companies; Policy implications; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Power markets,4,1,"1, 2",1
"Abate G.D., Haldrup N.",Space-time modeling of electricity spot prices,2017,Energy Journal,1,"Using data for the Nord Pool power grid, we derive a space-time Durbin model for electricity spot prices with both temporal and spatial lags. Joint modeling of temporal and spatial adjustment effects is necessarily important when prices and loads are determined in a network grid. By using different spatial weight matrices, statistical tests show significant spatial dependence in the spot price dynamics across areas. In fact, estimation of the model shows that the spatial dependence is as important as the temporal dependence in describing the spot price dynamics. We decompose price impacts into direct and indirect effects and demonstrate how price effects transmit to neighboring markets and decline with distance. A forecasting comparison with a non-spatial model shows that the space-time model improves forecasting performance for 7 and 30 days ahead forecasts. A model with time-varying parameters is estimated for an expanded sample period and it is found that the spatial correlation within the power grid has increased over time. We interpret this to indicate an increasing degree of market integration within the sample period. © 2017 by the IAEE.

An ensemble method composed of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) is presented in this paper. For this purpose, the electricity price signal was first decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by EMD, followed by a KRR which was used to model each extracted IMF and predict the tendencies. Finally, the prediction results of all IMFs were combined by an SVR to obtain an aggregated output for electricity price. The electricity price datasets from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed EMD-KRR-SVR approach.

"Amountzias C., Dagdeviren H., Patokos T.",Pricing decisions and market power in the uk electricity market: A VECM approach,2017,Energy Policy,11,"This paper examines the influence of market power in the formation of retail and wholesale electricity prices in the UK over 1998–2012 on the basis of Vector Error Correction model (VECM). Market power is measured as the influence of the market share of the Big Six in a dynamic demand and supply VECM. The findings indicate that market power of the Big Six in the wholesale industry has a significant and large positive influence on the wholesale mark-up in the short-run. The long-run estimates support the arguments about ‘revenue rebalancing’ resulting from vertical integration. That is, low market power (and hence low revenues) in the wholesale industry leads to higher prices (hence higher revenues) in the retail industry. These findings are in contrast to the CMA's finding that no market power is exercised in the wholesale industry. Retail electricity prices are affected directly by both the wholesale and retail market concentration ratios in the long-run rather than indirectly through the wholesale mark-up. Overall, the findings in this paper provide support for the view that the UK electricity market exhibits significant anti-competitive conduct in both the retail and wholesale segments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity; Market power; Retail; The Big Six; UK; Wholesale,Competition; Costs; Economics; Electric industry; Electricity; Error correction; Power markets; Sales; Electricity prices; Market Power; Retail; The Big Six; Vector error correction model; Vertical integration; Wholesale; Wholesale electricity; Commerce; competition (economics); electricity; energy market; error correction; numerical model; price dynamics; retailing; vector; vertical integration; United Kingdom,4,0,1,1

"Domanski P.D., Gintrowski M.",Alternative approaches to the prediction of electricity prices,2017,International Journal of Energy Sector Management,8,"Purpose: This paper aims to present the results of the comparison between different approaches to the prediction of electricity prices. It is well-known that the properties of the data generation process may prefer some modeling methods over the others. The data having an origin in social or market processes are characterized by unexpectedly wide realization space resulting in the existence of the long tails in the probabilistic density function. These data may not be easy in time series prediction using standard approaches based on the normal distribution assumptions. The electricity prices on the deregulated market fall into this category. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents alternative approaches, i.e. memory-based prediction and fractal approach compared with established nonlinear method of neural networks. The appropriate interpretation of results is supported with the statistical data analysis and data conditioning. These algorithms have been applied to the problem of the energy price prediction on the deregulated electricity market with data from Polish and Austrian energy stock exchanges. Findings: The first outcome of the analysis is that there are several situations in the task of time series prediction, when standard modeling approach based on the assumption that each change is independent of the last following random Gaussian bell pattern may not be a true. In this paper, such a case was considered: price data from energy markets. Electricity prices data are biased by the human nature. It is shown that more relevant for data properties was Cauchy probabilistic distribution. Results have shown that alternative approaches may be used and prediction for both data memory-based approach resulted in the best performance. Research limitations/implications: “Personalization” of the model is crucial aspect in the whole methodology. All available knowledge should be used on the forecasted phenomenon and incorporate it into the model. In case of the memory-based modeling, it is a specific design of the history searching routine that uses the understanding of the process features. Importance should shift toward methodology structure design and algorithm customization and then to parameter estimation. Such modeling approach may be more descriptive for the user enabling understanding of the process and further iterative improvement in a continuous striving for perfection. Practical implications: Memory-based modeling can be practically applied. These models have large potential that is worth to be exploited. One disadvantage of this modeling approach is large calculation effort connected with a need of constant evaluation of large data sets. It was shown that a graphics processing unit (GPU) approach through parallel calculation on the graphical cards can improve it dramatically. Social implications: The modeling of the electricity prices has big impact of the daily operation of the electricity traders and distributors. From one side, appropriate modeling can improve performance mitigating risks associated with the process. Thus, the end users should receive higher quality of services ultimately with lower prices and minimized risk of the energy loss incidents. Originality/value: The use of the alternative approaches, such as memory-based reasoning or fractals, is very rare in the field of the electricity price forecasting. Thus, it gives a new impact for further research enabling development of better solutions incorporating all available process knowledge and customized hybrid algorithms. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Artificial intelligence; Econometric; Energy sector; Forecasting; Modelling; Neural networks; Pricing; Time series analysis,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Deregulation; Electronic trading; Energy dissipation; Forecasting; Fractals; Graphics processing unit; Iterative methods; Models; Neural networks; Normal distribution; Power markets; Probability distributions; Program processors; Time series analysis; Deregulated electricity market; Design/methodology/approach; Econometric; Electricity price forecasting; Energy sector; Probabilistic density function; Probabilistic distribution; Statistical data analysis; Costs,5,1,1,1

In the deregulated environment price forecasting is an important aspect for the power system planning. The problem of price forecasting can be entirely viewed as a signal processing problem with proper estimation of model parameters, modeling of uncertainties, etc. Among the different existing models the artificial neural network based models have gained wide popularity due their black box structure but it too has its own limitations.

However, electricity price series usually has complex features such as non-linearity, non-stationarity and volatility, which makes the price forecasting turn out to be very difficult.

Medium term forecasting and risk analysis are important for operational scheduling, fuel purchasing, trading, and profit management. We extend the research on hybrid forecasting methods, which link detailed fundamental price formation models, using optimization techniques and market equilibrium considerations, with econometric recalibration to the time series data. This paper is innovative in its use of quantile regression to undertake the recalibration and provide accurate risk estimates. It is shown that probabilistic outputs from the fundamental model add value over expected value inputs to the quantile regressions and that if the fundamental model is itself well specified to diurnal variation through the inclusion of relevant explanatory variables such as demand or climatic conditions, then it is not necessary to undertake the quantile regressions separately for each hour of the day. A real application of the proposed methodology is successfully tested on the Spanish electric power system, in which the high penetration of intermittent wind generation creates extreme price risks.

Self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) is adopted to search for the optimal kernel parameters of the KELM. After testing the wavelet decomposition components, stationary series as new input sets are predicted by the ARMA model and non-stationary series are predicted by the SAPSO-KELM model.

Higher wind generation forecast errors tend to reduce the RTMprices, chiefly because unanticipated increases in wind generation reduce the real-time net loads to be served by fossil fuel power plants.

In this paper, we consider the problem of understanding how fundamental drivers impact the probability of extreme price occurrences in the German day-ahead electricity market. We develop models using fundamental variables to predict the probability of extreme prices. The dynamics of negative prices and positive price spikes differ greatly. Positive spikes are related to high demand, low supply and high prices the previous days, and mainly occur during the morning and afternoon peak hours. Negative prices occur mainly during the night and are closely related to low demand combined with high wind production levels. Furthermore, we do a closer analysis of how renewable energy sources, hereby photovoltaic and wind power, impact the probability of negative prices and positive spikes. The models confirm that extremely high and negative prices have different drivers, and that wind power is particularly important in relation to negative price occurrences. The models capture the main drivers of both positive and negative extreme price occurrences and perform well with respect to accurately forecasting the probability with high levels of confidence. Our results suggest that probability models are well suited to aid in risk management for market participants in day-ahead electricity markets. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Energy markets; EPEX; Fundamental analysis; Spikes,,4,1,1,2

"Manner H., Türk D., Eichler M.",Modeling and forecasting multivariate electricity price spikes,2016,Energy Economics,11,"We consider the problem of forecasting the occurrence of extreme prices in the Australian electricity markets from high frequency spot prices. In particular, we are interested in the simultaneous occurrence of such so-called spikes in two or more markets. Our approach is based on a novel dynamic model for multivariate binary outcomes, which allows the latent variables driving these observed outcomes to follow a vector autoregressive process. Furthermore the model is constructed using a copula representation for the joint distribution of the resulting innovations. This has several advantages over the standard multivariate probit model. First, it allows for nonlinear dependence between the error terms. Second, the distribution of the latent errors can be chosen freely. Third, the computational burden can be greatly reduced making estimation feasible in higher dimensions and for large samples. The model is applied to spikes in half-hourly electricity prices in four interconnected Australian markets. The multivariate model provides a superior fit compared to single-equation models and generates better forecasts for spike probabilities. Furthermore, evidence of spillover dynamics between the markets is revealed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Copulas; Electricity price spikes; Multivariate binary choice models; Vector autoregression,Bins; Commerce; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Australian electricity market; Auto regressive process; Binary choice models; Copulas; Electricity price spikes; Modeling and forecasting; Multivariate modeling; Vector autoregressions; Costs; electricity supply; energy market; modeling; multivariate analysis; price dynamics; vector autoregression; Australia,4,1,1,"1, 2"

Thus, how to select an optimization model to improve the forecasting accuracy of electricity price is not only an extremely challenging problem but also a concerned problem for different participants in an electricity market due to our society becoming heavily reliant on electricity. Many researchers developed hybrid models through the use of optimization methods, classical statistical models, artificial intelligence approaches and de-noising methods. However, few researchers aim to select reasonable samples and determine appropriate features when forecasting electricity price. Based on the Index of Bad Samples Matrix (IBSM), a novel method to dynamically confirm bad training samples, and the Optimization Algorithm (OA), DCANN and Updated DCANN are proposed in this paper for forecasting the day-ahead electricity price. This model is a hybrid system of supervised and unsupervised learning and creatively applies the idea of deleting bad samples and searching quality inputs to develop and learn, which is unlike BPANN, RBFN, SVM and LSSVM. Numerical results show that the proposed model is not only able to approximate the actual electricity price (normal or high volatility) but also an effective tool for h-step-ahead forecasting (h is less than 10) compared to benchmarks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Dynamic choosing artificial neural network (DCANN); Electricity price; Index of bad samples matrix (IBSM); Optimization algorithm (OA); Unsupervised learning,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Costs; Data mining; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Unsupervised learning; Bad samples; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Optimization algorithms; Optimization modeling; Supervised and unsupervised learning; Power markets,5,"1, 2",1,1

We estimate the considered linear regression model by the lasso estimation method. The lasso approach allows for many possible parameters in the model, but also shrinks and sparsifies the parameters automatically to avoid overfitting. Thus, it is able to capture the autoregressive intraday dependency structure of the electricity price well. We discuss in detail the estimation results which provide insights to the intraday behavior of electricity prices.

Because of nonlinearity, nonstationary, and volatility of electricity price, it is highly essential to forecast the price on a short-term scale. This paper presents an efficient method based on a hybrid functional link dynamic neural network (DNN) trained by an adaptive robust unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The proposed method forecasts hourly prices for the day-ahead electricity market. The functional block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher-dimensional space through a basis function without using any hidden layer like multilayer perceptron structure. The DNN includes one or more infinite impulse response filters in the forward path providing feedback connections between outputs and inputs. This allows signal flow in both forward and backward directions, giving the network a dynamic memory useful to mimic dynamic systems. Also to improve the accuracy of the forecast, the noise covariance matrices of the UKF are adapted recursively. The proposed method is tested on PJM electricity market, and the residuals mean absolute error is compared with other forecasting methods, indicating the improved accuracy of the approach and its suitability to produce a real-time forecast. Further, to compare the accuracy of the forecast, an alternative UKF noise covariance optimization is attempted using differential evolution. © 2015, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Dynamic neurons; Electricity price; Forecasting; Functional links; Unscented Kalman filter,Commerce; Costs; Covariance matrix; Electric industry; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; IIR filters; Impulse response; Kalman filters; Neural networks; Nonlinear filtering; Optimization; Day-ahead electricity market; Dynamic neurons; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Functional links; Pjm electricity markets; Restructured power markets; Unscented Kalman Filter; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1

Load and price in electricity markets have complex peculiarities, such as nonlinearity, being nonstationary and irregular. Accurate short-term forecasting, such as hourly electricity price forecasting (EPF) for the next month gives pivotal information to power producers and consumers to enhance precise techniques to maximize their profit. This paper deals with short-term hourly EPF for the next month (January 2006), using the historical hourly data for the year 2005 as a training set.

The intent is to study the behavior of diverse composite topologies to compare the best performance indices evaluated by the mean absolute percentage error and mean square error. The performance of different topologies is compared to identify the best connection architecture.

It will be the first approach which is able to combine the insights of market structure models with extensive and modern econometric analysis. Instead of directly modeling the electricity price as it is usually done in time series or data mining approaches, we model and utilize its true source: the sale and purchase curves of the electricity exchange. We will refer to this new model as X-Model, as almost every deregulated electricity price is simply the result of the intersection of the electricity supply and demand curve at a certain auction. Therefore we show an approach to deal with a tremendous amount of auction data, using a subtle data processing technique as well as dimension reduction and lasso based estimation methods. We incorporate not only several known features, such as seasonal behavior or the impact of other processes like renewable energy, but also completely new elaborated stylized facts of the bidding structure.

Responsiveness of the market participants can improve reliability of system operation as well as capital cost investments. In this regard, the accurate forecast of electricity price and demand in smart grids is an important challenge as their strong correlation makes a separate forecasting to be ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneous forecast of price and demand that uses a set of effective tools in preprocessing part, forecast engine and tuned algorithm. To highlight our contributions, the proposed forecast algorithm classified into three main parts. The first part employs a new Flexible Wavelet Packet Transform (FWPT) to decompose a signal into multiple terms at different frequencies, and a new feature selection method that employs Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) and adjacent features in order to select valuable input data. The second part consists of a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model based on Nonlinear Least Square Support Vector Machine (NLSSVM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in order to model the linear and nonlinear correlation between price and load in two stages. The final part employs a modified version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm based on time-varying coefficients and stumble generation operator, called TV-SABC, in order to optimize NLSSVM parameters in a learning process. The proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm is evaluated on several real and well-known markets illustrating its high accuracy in simultaneous forecast of electricity price and demand. Moreover, the interactive effects of demand-side management programs on load factor (load curve) and price signal are investigated by numerical indices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Demand-side management; Feature selection; Load and price forecasting; Smart grids; Wavelet transform,Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Demand side management; Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Investments; Learning algorithms; MIMO systems; Optimization; Packet networks; Power markets; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Conditional mutual information; Feature selection methods; Multi-input-multi-output models; Price forecasting; Smart grid; Wavelet packet transforms; Smart power grids; algorithm; capital market; correlation; demand analysis; demand-side management; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; wavelet analysis; Apoidea,"4, 5","1, 2",1,2

Mainly, the prediction task in energy markets has been studied in the literature with the aim of obtaining scalar (hourly, daily, ...) forecasts given scalar (and/or, less frequently, functional) historical data. This paper provides two methods to predict next-day electricity demand and price daily curves given information from past curves.

Customers tend to rely on electricity for day-to-day living and cannot replace it easily so when electricity prices increase, customer demand generally does not reduce significantly in the short-term. As electricity generation and customer demand must be matched perfectly second-by-second, and because generation cannot be stored to a large extent, cost bids from generators must be balanced with demand estimates in advance of real-time. This paper outlines a a forecasting algorithm built on artificial neural networks in order to predict short-term (72 hours ahead) wholesale prices on the Irish Single Electricity Market so that market participants can make more informed trading decisions.

"Vardanyan Y., Hesamzadeh M.R.",Modeling regime switching in day-ahead market prices using Markov model,2016,IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe,1,"The accurate price forecasting of electricity market is crucial for profit maximizing producers and consumers in liberalized power markets. In all market places (day-ahead, intra-day and real-time) accurate price prediction is needed to generate optimal bids and maximize the profit. This paper first presents three methods for forecasting day-ahead market prices, namely Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heterosedastic (GARCH), Holt-Winter (HW) and Mean Reversion and Jump Diffusion (MRJD). These methods are based on three broad methodologies of time series analysis, exponential-smoothing and stochastic processes. The dynamics of hourly prices in day-ahead market are varying from day to day. Each forecasting tool is suitable to capture one type of price dynamics. To capture this phenomenon, we combine GARCH, HW and MRJD methods using proposed Markov switch. The proposed Markov model is tested using Nordic day-ahead prices. © 2016 IEEE.",Day-ahead prices; forecasting tools; Markov switch,Commerce; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Markov processes; Power markets; Profitability; Smart power grids; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive; Day ahead market; Day-ahead prices; Exponential smoothing; Forecasting tools; Price forecasting; Price prediction; Regime switching; Costs,"3, 4",1,1,1
"Panapakidis I.P., Dagoumas A.S.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting via the application of artificial neural network based models,2016,Applied Energy,130,"Traditionally, short-term electricity price forecasting has been essential for utilities and generation companies. However, the deregulation of electricity markets created a competitive environment and the introduction of new market participants, such as the retailers and aggregators, whose economic viability and profitability highly depends on the spot market price patterns. The aim of this study is to examine artificial neural network (ANN) based models for Day-ahead price forecasting. Specifically, the models refer to the sole application of ANNs or to hybrid models, where the ANN is combined with clustering algorithm. The training data are clustered in homogenous groups and for each cluster, a dedicated forecaster is employed. The proposed models are characterized by comprehensive operation and by high level of flexibility; different inputs can be taken under consideration and different ANN topologies can be examined. The models are tested on a data set that consists of atypical price patterns and many outliers. This approach makes the price forecasting problem a more challenging task, providing evidence that the proposed models can be considered as useful and robust forecasting tools to the actual needs of market participants, including the traditional generation companies and self-producers, but also the retailers/suppliers and aggregators. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial neural networks; Day-ahead market; Electricity price forecasting; Time-series clustering,Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Forecasting; Neural networks; Competitive environment; Day ahead market; Economic viability; Electricity price forecasting; Generation companies; Market participants; Price forecasting; Time series clustering; Power markets,5,1,1,1
"Rafiei M., Niknam T., Khooban M.H.",A novel intelligent strategy for probabilistic electricity price forecasting: Wavelet neural network based modified dolphin optimization algorithm,2016,Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems,12,"To simplify decision making of market participants, a careful and reliable electricity market price forecasting method is indispensable. Nevertheless, due to the Instability in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather tough to forecast MCPs accurately. Using probabilistic forecasting is a new solution to overcome the low accuracy of forecast. Transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts is too important to model the uncertainties of forecasts. Thus the decision making activities of market participants are supported against uncertainties and risks effectively. In this paper a hybrid approach to achieve prediction intervals (PIs) of MCPs is proposed that modified dolphin echolocation optimization algorithm (MDEOA) is applied to estimate point forecasts, model uncertainties, and noise variance. This proposed electricity price probabilistic forecasting method is evaluated by a generalized and comprehensive framework. To test the proposed hybrid method, real price data from Ontario, New England, and, Australian electricity markets are used and effectiveness of the method is validated. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.",modified dolphin echolocation optimization algorithm; prediction intervals; Probabilistic forecasting; wavelet neural network; wavelet preprocessing,Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Dolphins (structures); Optimization; Power markets; Sonar; Uncertainty analysis; Optimization algorithms; Prediction interval; Probabilistic forecasting; Wavelet neural networks; Wavelet pre-processing; Forecasting,"4, 5",1,1,2

In such conditions, electricity price is a key index that reflects competition between generators, percentage of renewable generation and load behavior. An accurate forecast of the future price allows both producers and customers to plan their strategies, increase their profits and avoid contingencies. For this purpose, this paper proposes two predictors that perform half-hour-ahead and dayahead price forecast, respectively. Both predictors are based on three learning machines, namely artificial neural network, support vector regression and random forest, in addition to persistence model which is used as reference. The built models are tested through real historical time series from New South Wales in Australia, which include half-hourly price and load. The profiles are analyzed with the aim of defining correlations and choosing adequate inputs. Then, the performance of each machine is assessed using the mean absolute percentage error, in order to determine the most suitable prediction machine according to the case. Furthermore, the best forecast situations are plotted to evaluate the ability of predicting sudden and sharp price peaks. © 2016 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Day-ahead market; Deregulation; Short term price forecasting,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Deregulation; Electric power measurement; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Comparative studies; Day ahead market; Day-ahead price forecasts; Deregulated markets; Mean absolute percentage error; Renewable generation; Short-term price forecasting; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets,5,1,1,1

The first question is timely and relevant because if the merit-order effect estimates are small, California's renewable energy development is of limited help in cutting electricity consumers' bills but also has a lesser adverse impact on the state's investment incentive for natural-gas-fired generation. The second question is related to the efficient market hypothesis under which the hourly RTM and DAM prices tend to converge. Using a sample of about 21,000 hourly observations of CAISO market prices and their fundamental drivers during 12/12/2012-04/30/2015, we document statistically significant estimates (p-value≤0.01) for the DAM and RTM merit-order effects. This finding lends support to California's adopted procurement process to provide sufficient investment incentives for natural-gas-fired generation. We document that the RTM-DAM price divergence partly depends on the CASIO's day-ahead forecast errors for system loads and renewable energy. This finding suggests that improving the performance of the CAISO's day-ahead forecasts can enhance trading efficiency in California's DAM and RTM electricity markets. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",California; Day-ahead market; Electricity prices; Merit-order effects; Real-time market; Renewable energy,Commerce; Costs; Dams; Electric utilities; Investments; Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; California; Day ahead market; Electricity prices; Ordering effects; Real-time market; Renewable energies; Power markets; alternative energy; electricity supply; energy market; energy policy; price dynamics; renewable resource; California; United States,"2, 4",1,"1, 2",1
"Hagfors L.I., Bunn D., Kristoffersen E., Staver T.T., Westgaard S.",Modeling the UK electricity price distributions using quantile regression,2016,Energy,23,"In this paper we develop fundamental quantile regression models for the UK electricity price in each trading period. Intraday properties of price risk, as represented by the predictive distribution rather than expected values, have previously not been fully analyzed. The sample covers half hourly data from 2005 to 2012. From our analysis we are able to show how the sensitivity towards different fundamental factors changes across quantiles and time of day. In the UK the supply of electricity is to a large extent generated from coal and gas plants, thus the price of gas and coal, as well as the carbon emission price, are included as fundamental factors in our model. We also include the electricity price lagged by one day, as well as demand and margin forecasts. We find that the sensitivities vary across the price distribution. Our findings also suggest that the sensitivity to fundamental factors exhibit intraday variation. We find that the sensitivity to gas relative to coal is higher in high quantiles and lower in low quantiles, as well as some indications of market power being exercised during peak hours. We have demonstrated a scenario analysis based on the quantile regression models, showing how changes in the values of the fundamentals influence the electricity price distribution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity markets; Prices; Quantile regression; Risk,Carbon; Coal; Commerce; Gas plants; Power markets; Regression analysis; Risks; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon emission prices; Electricity prices; Expected values; Predictive distributions; Prices; Quantile regression; Scenario analysis; Trading periods; Costs; carbon emission; demand analysis; energy market; power generation; price dynamics; pricing policy; regression analysis; risk assessment; United Kingdom,4,1,2,2
"Dillig M., Jung M., Karl J.",The impact of renewables on electricity prices in Germany - An estimation based on historic spot prices in the years 2011-2013,2016,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,58,Germanys public opinion and media usually attribute increasing electricity prices to the high share of renewables in the German power system. But average electricity prices at the European Energy Exchange dropped during the last years due to an excess of renewable energy. This study uses historic market data in order to quantify the effect of renewables on prices. Historic demand and supply curves from 2011 to 2013 have been used to reconstruct electricity prices under the assumption that no wind and PV would be available. The analysis reveals an astonishingly high increase of market prices up to 5.29 ct/kWh due to a lack of non-renewable power capacities. In 2013 the available conventional capacity would not have been able to cover the demand during 269 hours. The estimated maximum deficit of 5.6 GW is in good agreement to data published by the German grid operators. The discussion of the origin of this deficit leads to the conclusion that the current situation has not been caused by renewables. The liberalization of the European energy market established investment risks that hindered required investment a long time before the renewables boomed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.,Electricity market modeling; Energy economics; Generation capacity; Merit order effect; Renewable electricity,Commerce; Costs; Economics; Power markets; Social aspects; Electricity market model; Energy economics; Generation capacity; Ordering effects; Renewable electricity; Investments,−1,−1,1,−1
"Ortiz M., Ukar O., Azevedo F., Múgica A.",Price forecasting and validation in the Spanish electricity market using forecasts as input data,2016,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,15,"The electricity sector has been subjected to major changes in the last few years. Previously, there existed a regulated system where electric companies could know beforehand the amount of energy each generator would produce, hence basing their largely operational strategy on cost minimization in order to increase their profits. In Spain, from 1988 till 1997, electricity prices were established by the 'Marco Legal Estable' - Stable Legal Framework -, where the Ministry of Industry and Energy acknowledged the existence of certain generation costs related to each type of technology. It was an industrial sector with no actual competition and therefore, with very few controllable risks. In the aftermath of the electricity market liberalization competition and uncertainty arose. Electricity spot prices became highly volatile due to the specific characteristics of electricity as a commodity. Long-term contracts allowed for hedge funds to act against price fluctuation in the electricity market. As a consequence, developing an accurate electricity price forecasting model is an extremely difficult task for electricity market agents. This work aims to propose a methodology to improve the limitations of those methodologies just using historical data to forecast electricity prices. In this manner, and in order to gain access to more recent data, instead of using natural gas prices and electricity load historical data, a regression model to forecast the evolution of natural gas prices, and a model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to forecast electricity loads, are proposed. The results of these models are used as input for an electricity price forecast model. Finally, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, several study cases applied to the Spanish market, using real price data, are presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial neural network; Electricity markets; Price forecast; Regression model; Volatility,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Electric industry; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Natural gas; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Long-term contracts; Operational strategies; Price forecasts; Regression model; Spanish electricity markets; Volatility; Power markets,"4, 5",3,1,1

This paper presents such a model (named K-SVR). While yielding prediction accuracy comparable with the best known models in the literature, K-SVR requires a significantly reduced computational time. The computational reduction is attained by eliminating the use of a feature selection process, which is commonly used by the existing models in the literature. K-SVR is a hybrid model that combines clustering algorithms, support vector machine, and support vector regression. K-SVR is tested using Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland market data from the periods 2005-6, 2011-12, and 2014-15. Market data from 2006 has been used to measure performance of many of the existing models. Authors chose these models to compare performance and demonstrate strengths of K-SVR.

Trying to predict these events is crucial for market agents in a competitive environment. This paper proposes a novel methodology to simultaneously accomplish punctual and probabilistic hourly predictions about the appearance of extremely low electricity prices in a medium-term scope. The proposed approach for making real ex ante forecasts consists of a nested compounding of different forecasting techniques, which incorporate Monte Carlo simulation, combined with spatial interpolation techniques. The procedure is based on the statistical identification of the process key drivers. Logistic regression for rare events, decision trees, multilayer perceptrons and a hybrid approach, which combines a market equilibrium model with logistic regression, are used. Moreover, this paper assesses whether periodic models in which parameters switch according to the day of the week can be even more accurate. The proposed techniques are compared to a Markov regime switching model and several naive methods. The proposed methodology empirically demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving promising results on a real case study based on the Spanish electricity market.

Price forecasting is very important for online trading, e-commerce and power system operation. Forecasting the hourly locational marginal prices (LMP) in the electricity markets is a very important basis for the decision making in order to maximize the profits/benefits. The novel approach proposed in this paper for forecasting the electricity prices uses WLS technique and compares the results with the results obtained by using ANNs. To perform this price forecasting, the market knowledge is utilized to optimize the selection of input data for the electricity price forecasting tool. In this paper, price forecasting for Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection is demonstrated using the ANNs and the proposed WLS technique. The data used for this price forecasting is obtained from the PJM website. The forecasting results obtained by both methods are compared, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting approach. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the accuracy of prediction has increased in both seasons using the proposed WLS technique. Another important advantage of the proposed WLS technique is that it is not an iterative method. © 2016, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",artificial neural networks; day-ahead electricity markets; load forecasting; load serving entities; price forecasting,,5,1,1,1

This paper places itself in price directed power systems, where participants respond with their load demand to incoming price signals. To that end, a two hour-ahead forecasting method using a linear composition of kernel machines for electricity prices is introduced. Initially, two kernel machines, i.e., a Gaussian process (GP) and a relevance vector machine (RVM), are utilized for next-two-hour prediction making. Subsequently, a linear predictor composed of the two kernel machines, which are both equipped with the Gaussian kernel, is built that integrates the individual predictions to provide a single one. The linear coefficients are obtained as the solution of multiobjective problem that is sought by a genetic algorithm utilizing Pareto optimality theory. Method testing is performed on a set of historical data obtained from the New England area.

Explaining price variations in the German day-ahead and intraday power market,2016,Energy Economics,42,"European electricity market participants are encouraged to balance intraday deviations from their day-ahead schedules via trades in the intraday market. Together with the increasing production of variable renewable energy sources (RES), the intraday market is gaining importance. We investigate the explanatory power of a fundamental modeling approach explicitly accounting for must-run operations of combined heat and power plants (CHP) and intraday peculiarities such as a shortened intraday supply stack. The fundamental equilibria between every hour's supply stack and aggregated demand in 2012 and 2013 are modeled to yield hourly price estimates. The major benefits of a fundamental modeling approach are the ability to account for non-linearities in the supply stack and the ability to combine time-varying information consistently. The empirical results show that fundamental modeling explains a considerable share of spot price variance. However, differences between the fundamental and actual prices persist and are explored using regression models.

In this article, we assess the forecasting ability of several classes of time-series models for electricity wholesale spot prices at a day-ahead horizon in France. Electricity spot prices display a strong seasonal pattern, particularly in France, given the high share of electric heating in housing during winter time. To deal with this pattern, we implement a double temporal segmentation of the data. For each trading period and season, we use a large number of specifications based on market fundamentals: linear regressions, Markov-switching (MS) models and threshold models with a smooth transition. An extensive evaluation on French data shows that modelling each season independently leads to better results. Among nonlinear models, MS models designed to capture the sudden and fast-reverting spikes in the price dynamics yield more accurate forecasts. Finally, pooling forecasts give more reliable results. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",combinations; electricity spot prices; Forecasting; regime-switching; seasonality,electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; Markov chain; modeling; price dynamics; seasonality; time series; France,3,1,1,1
"Keles D., Scelle J., Paraschiv F., Fichtner W.",Extended forecast methods for day-ahead electricity spot prices applying artificial neural networks,2016,Applied Energy,105,"Day-ahead electricity prices are generally used as reference prices for decisions done in energy trading, e.g. purchase and sale strategies are typically based on the day-ahead spot prices. Therefore, well-performing forecast methods for day-ahead electricity prices are essential for energy traders and supply companies.In this paper, a methodology based on artificial neuronal networks (ANN) is presented to forecast electricity prices. As the performance of an ANN forecast model depends on appropriate input parameter sets, the focus is set on the selection and preparation of fundamental data that has a noticeable impact on electricity prices. This is done with the help of different cluster algorithms, but also by comparing the results of the pre-selected model configurations in combination with different input parameter settings. After the determination of the optimal input parameters, affecting day-ahead electricity prices, and well-performing ANN configuration, the developed ANN model is applied for in-sample and out-of-sample analyses. The results show that the overall methodology leads to well-fitting electricity price forecasts, whereas forecast errors are as low as or even lower than other forecast models for electricity prices known from the literature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial neuronal network; Day-ahead-market; Electricity prices; Input selection; Price forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Neural networks; Neurons; Artificial neuronal network; Day ahead market; Electricity prices; Input selection; Price forecasting; Power markets; algorithm; artificial neural network; electricity generation; energy market; forecasting method,5,1,1,1

Comparisons of errors from different ISMPF models identified the most important variables for forecasting purposes. Similar analyses were applied to determine the best daily session models for price forecasts (DSMPF models) for the day-ahead price forecasting in the daily session of the MIBEL, considering as input variables extensive hourly time series records of recent prices, power demands and power generations in the previous day, forecasts of demand, wind power generation and weather for the day-ahead, and chronological variables. ISMPF models include the input variables of DSMPF models as well as the daily session prices and prices of preceding intraday sessions. The best ISMPF models achieved lower MAPEs for most of the intraday sessions compared to the error of the best DSMPF model; furthermore, such DSMPF error was very close to the lowest limit error for the daily session.

Advances in measurement tools in these networks make it easy to move towards dynamic pricing and non-fixed electricity tariffs. In this environment, the forecasted electricity price is declared to wholesale and retail consumers via Advanced Measurement Instruments (AMI). Therefore, motivated by different factors such as optimizing the economic/environmental issues or increasing the reliability, the customers are able to react to prices and manage their consumption. This pattern of reaction brings about extensive changes in the load and price curves of the network. On the other hand, environmental concerns resulting from the use of fossil fuels have increased the exploitation of renewable energies. But, as the penetration of renewable energy sources increases, serious improvements and modifications for the existing electric grid are needed to accommodate and integrate these intermittent sources. In this paper, a hybrid model is presented for simultaneous short term forecasting of electricity prices considering Distributed Generation (DG) in the price-sensitive environment of smart grids. The proposed model combines the Support Vector Regression (SVR) network with an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) network, and it is capable of tracking customers' reaction to declared prices.

Price forecasting method takes the big price data into account, and gives estimates of the future electricity price. However, most of existing price forecasting methods cannot avoid redundancy at feature selection and lack of an integrated framework that coordinates the steps in forecasting. To address this issue, we first propose a new electricity price forecasting framework. It is significant to design a system tool chain based on big data analytics for ensuring that the users can make appropriate decisions. To this end, three algorithms are proposed integratedly. First, feature redundancy elimination is implemented by the fusion of Grey Correlation Analysis (GCA) and ReliefF algorithm. Second, a combination of Kernel function and Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) is designed to achieve dimensionality reduction. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization algorithm based on differential evolution (DE) is proposed to forecast price classification.

This paper focuses on Locational Marginal Price (LMP) that efficiently maintains power markets by alleviating transmission network congestion. There are complicated behaviors of the time series due to uncertain factors in the power markets. From a standpoint of market players, a sophisticated method is required to forecast LMP effectively. The proposed method makes use of the hybridization of GP (Gaussian Process) of hierarchical Bayesian estimation, EPSO (Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization) of evolutionary computation and fuzzy c-means of allowing data to belong to two or more clusters. EPSO is used to improve the accuracy of parameters in MAP (Maximum a Posteriori) estimation for GP. The use of fuzzy c-mean is useful for increasing the number of learning data for GP to deal with spikes.

Thus, in the electricity markets, accurate electricity price forecasting plays significant role for power producers and consumers. Although many studies developing and proposing highly accurate forecasting models exist in the literature, there have been few investigations on improving the forecasting effectiveness of electricity price from the perspective of reducing the volatility of data with satisfactory accuracy. Based on reducing the volatility of the electricity price and the forecasting nature of the radial basis function network (RBFN), this paper successfully develops a two-stage model to forecast the day-ahead electricity price, of which the first stage is particle swarm optimization (PSO)-core mapping (CM) with self-organizing-map and fuzzy set (PCMwSF), and the second stage is selection rule (SR). The PCMwSF stage applies CM, fuzzy set and optimized weights to obtain the future price, and the SR stage is inspired by the forecasting nature of RBFN and effectively selects the best forecast during the test period.

"Mori H., Nakano K.",EPSO-based Gaussian process for electricity price forecasting,2015,"2015 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2015 - Proceedings",1,"In this paper, a new method is proposed for Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) forecasting in Smart Grid. The marginal cost is required to supply electric power to incremental loads in case where a certain node increases power demands in a balanced power system. LMP plays an important role to maintain economic efficiency in electric power markets in a way that electricity flows from a low-cost area to high-cost ones and the transmission network congestion is alleviated. The power market players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their aim is achieved. This paper presents the Gaussian Process (GP) technique that comes from the extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in which hierarchical Bayesian estimation is introduced to express the model parameters as the probabilistic variables. The advantage is that the model accuracy of GP is better than others. GP is integrated with k-means of clustering to improve the performance of GP.

Forecasting price in competitive electricity markets is difficult for consumers and producers in order to plan their operations and to manage their price risk, and it also plays a key role in the economic optimization of the deregulated power industry. Accurate, short-term price forecasting is an essential instrument which provides crucial information for power producers and consumers to develop accurate bidding strategies in order to maximize their profit. In this paper artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in short-term price forecasting that is, the one hour ahead price forecast of the electricity market. A new artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to compute the forecasted price in Ontario electricity market using MATLAB R13b. The data used in the forecasting are hourly historical data of the electricity load and price of Ontario electricity market. The simulation results have shown highly accurate one hour ahead forecasts with very small error in price forecasting. © 2015 IEEE.",locational marginal price (LMP); mean absolute error (MAE); mean absolute percentage error (MAPE); neural network (NN); One hour ahead electricity price forecast; power system; short-term price forecasting,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Deregulation; Economics; Electric industry; Errors; Forecasting; MATLAB; Neural networks; Electricity prices; Locational marginal prices; Mean absolute error; Mean absolute percentage error; Neural network (nn); power system; Short-term price forecasting; Power markets,5,1,2,1

"Grossi L., Nan F.",Robust smooth transition threshold autoregressive models for electricity prices,2015,"International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM",3,"In this paper we suggest the use of robust STAR (Smooth Transition AutoRegressive) processes to model and forecast electricity prices observed on deregulated markets. The robustness of the model is achieved by extending to time series the M-type estimator based on the polynomial weighting function first introduced for independent multivariate data. The robust M-STAR estimator can be considered as a generalization of the robust SETAR estimator [1], because in STAR processes the change from one regime to another is ruled by a smooth function rather than by a fixed threshold. The main advantage of estimating robust STAR models is the possibility to capture two very well-known stylized facts of electricity prices: nonlinearity produced by changes of regimes and the presence of sudden spikes due to inelasticity of demand. The forecasting performance of the model is assessed through an application to the Italian electricity market (IPEX).

The increasing share of variable renewables in European power systems create a downward adequacy problem, which deals with the ability of power systems to cope with periods of excess generation. The occurrence of negative prices on Central Western European electricity markets confirms the relevance of this issue, which is referred to as ""incompressibility of power systems"" and is assessed as a barrier for further renewable power integration. The objective of this article is to identify the main drivers of negative price periods in European balancing markets, by means of both an empirical and regression analysis. Results confirm a positive relation with the scheduled generation of renewables and inflexible base load, as well as a negative relation with the scheduled system load. Furthermore, the occurrence of negative prices is related to the positive and negative forecast error of renewable generation and demand, respectively.

Kim M.-K.,A new approach to short-term price forecast strategy with an artificial neural network approach: Application to the Nord Pool,2015,Journal of Electrical Engineering and Technology,6,"In new deregulated electricity market, short-term price forecasting is key information for all market players. A better forecast of market-clearing price (MCP) helps market participants to strategically set up their bidding strategies for energy markets in the short-term. This paper presents a new prediction strategy to improve the need for more accurate short-term price forecasting tool at spot market using an artificial neural networks (ANNs). To build the forecasting ANN model, a threelayered feedforward neural network trained by the improved Levenberg-marquardt (LM) algorithm is used to forecast the locational marginal prices (LMPs). To accurately predict LMPs, actual power generation and load are considered as the input sets, and then the difference is used to predict price differences in the spot market. The proposed ANN model generalizes the relationship between the LMP in each area and the unconstrained MCP during the same period of time. The LMP calculation is iterated so that the capacity between the areas is maximized and the mechanism itself helps to relieve grid congestion. The addition of flow between the areas gives the LMPs a new equilibrium point, which is balanced when taking the transfer capacity into account, LMP forecasting is then possible. The proposed forecasting strategy is tested on the spot market of the Nord Pool. The validity, the efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed approach are shown by comparing with time-series models. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.",Artificial neural network; Levenberg-marquardt algorithm; Locational marginal price; Nord pool; Short-term forecasting,Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Feedforward neural networks; Lakes; Neural networks; Power markets; Artificial neural network approach; Deregulated electricity market; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Locational marginal prices; Nord pool; Short-term forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Three-layered feedforward neural networks; Forecasting,5,1,1,1

"Garciá-Martos C., Caro E., Jesús Sánchez M.",Electricity price forecasting accounting for renewable energies: Optimal combined forecasts,2015,Journal of the Operational Research Society,2,"Electricity price forecasting is an interesting problem for all the agents involved in electricity market operation. For instance, every profit maximisation strategy is based on the computation of accurate one-day-ahead forecasts, which is why electricity price forecasting has been a growing field of research in recent years. In addition, the increasing concern about environmental issues has led to a high penetration of renewable energies, particularly wind. In some European countries such as Spain, Germany and Denmark, renewable energy is having a deep impact on the local power markets. In this paper, we propose an optimal model from the perspective of forecasting accuracy, and it consists of a combination of several univariate and multivariate time series methods that account for the amount of energy produced with clean energies, particularly wind and hydro, which are the most relevant renewable energy sources in the Iberian Market. This market is used to illustrate the proposed methodology, as it is one of those markets in which wind power production is more relevant in terms of its percentage of the total demand, but of course our method can be applied to any other liberalised power market. As far as our contribution is concerned, first, the methodology proposed by Garciá-Martos et al (2007 and 2012) is generalised twofold: we allow the incorporation of wind power production and hydro reservoirs, and we do not impose the restriction of using the same model for 24 h. A computational experiment and a Design of Experiments (DOE) are performed for this purpose. Then, for those hours in which there are two or more models without statistically significant differences in terms of their forecasting accuracy, a combination of forecasts is proposed by weighting the best models (according to the DOE) and minimising the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAPE is the most popular accuracy metric for comparing electricity price forecasting models. We construct the combination of forecasts by solving several nonlinear optimisation problems that allow computation of the optimal weights for building the combination of forecasts. The results are obtained by a large computational experiment that entails calculating out-of-sample forecasts for every hour in every day in the period from January 2007 to December 2009. In addition, to reinforce the value of our methodology, we compare our results with those that appear in recent published works in the field. This comparison shows the superiority of our methodology in terms of forecasting accuracy. © 2015 Operational Research Society Ltd.

To overcome this shortage, a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model is presented which can consider the correlation between electricity price and load.

"Kalczynski P., Zerom D.",Price forecast valuation for the nyiso electricity market,2015,Kybernetes,,"Purpose – Following the deregulation of electricity markets in the USA, independent power producers operate as for-profit entities. Their profit depends on the price of electricity and an accurate forecast is critical in making bidding decisions on the electricity and reserve markets or engaging in bilateral contracts. Competing price forecasts have their accuracy expressed in statistical terms but producers need to determine the long-term value of using a given forecast. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue by presenting a method of electricity price forecast valuation which compares forecast models using financial rather than statistical measures. Design/methodology/approach – The objectives of this paper are achieved by mathematical modeling of thermal power plants and price forecast information available to market participants and simulating the operation of a thermal power plant using various price forecasts and perfect information (as a baseline). The operating profit calculated over a long period was used for ranking forecast models. Findings – The framework can be used to estimate the value of a new price forecast as well as to determine if potential gains from developing or acquiring a new forecast will justify the expenses. The results show that an improvement in terms of statistical forecast accuracy measures does not guarantee increased profit. Practical implications – This paper presents a new method for comparing electricity price forecast models. It can be adapted to various types of thermal power plants that operate on liberalized electricity markets and utilize price-based dynamic economic dispatch models.

Power producers and customers use short term price forecasts to manage and plan for bidding approaches, and hence increasing the utility's profit and energy efficiency as well. The main challenge in forecasting electricity price is when dealing with non-stationary and high volatile price series. Some of the factors influencing this volatility are load behavior, weather, fuel price and transaction of import and export due to long term contract. This paper proposes the use of Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization technique to predict daily electricity prices in Ontario. The selection of input data and LSSVM's parameter held by GA are proven to improve accuracy as well as efficiency of prediction. A comparative study of proposed approach with other techniques and previous research was conducted in term of forecast accuracy, where the results indicate that (1) the LSSVM with GA outperforms other methods of LSSVM and Neural Network (NN), (2) the optimization algorithm of GA gives better accuracy than Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and cross validation. However, future study should emphasize on improving forecast accuracy during spike event since Ontario power market is reported as among the most volatile market worldwide.",Electricity price forecasting; Genetic Algorithm (GA); Least square support vector machine (LSSVM); Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),,5,"2, 3",1,1

The available input variables include extensive hourly time series records of weather forecasts, previous prices, and regional aggregation of power generations and power demands. The paper presents the comparisons of the forecasting results achieved with a model which includes all these available input variables (EMPF model) with respect to those obtained by other forecasting models containing a reduced set of input variables. These comparisons identify the most important variables for forecasting purposes. In addition, a novel Reference Explanatory Model for Price Estimations (REMPE) that achieves hourly price estimations by using actual power generations and power demands of such day is described in the paper, which offers the lowest limit for the forecasting error of the EMPF model. All the models have been implemented using the same technique (artificial neural networks) and have been satisfactorily applied to the real-world case study of the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL). The relative importance of each explanatory variable is identified for the day-ahead price forecasts in the MIBEL.

This study presents a hybrid price forecasting framework based on a new data fusion algorithm. Owing to the complexity and distinct nature of the electricity price, a single forecast engine cannot capture all different patterns of the price signals. Hence, this study focuses on a hybrid forecasting method to extract the advantages of several forecasting engines. In the proposed method, artificial neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and autoregressive moving average are employed as primary forecast engines (agents) which provide three independent price forecasts. Then, a new data fusion algorithm, the modified ordered weighted average (modified OWA), is proposed to combine the three forecasts to generate a single unified price forecast. Hopefully, the fusion's output outperforms all the agents' forecasts. The author's proposed fusion algorithm, unlike conventional OWA, uses the feedback from the agents' error. The proposed framework is evaluated on the Spanish electricity market. The results confirm the ability of the proposed fusion framework to provide more accurate forecasts compared with the input agents forecasts.

A better forecast of market-clearing price (MCP) helps market participants to strategically set up their bidding strategies for energy markets in the short-term. This paper presents a new prediction strategy to improve the need for more accurate short-term price forecasting tool at spot market using an artificial neural networks (ANNs). To build the forecasting ANN model, a threelayered feedforward neural network trained by the improved Levenberg-marquardt (LM) algorithm is used to forecast the locational marginal prices (LMPs). To accurately predict LMPs, actual power generation and load are considered as the input sets, and then the difference is used to predict price differences in the spot market. The proposed ANN model generalizes the relationship between the LMP in each area and the unconstrained MCP during the same period of time. The LMP calculation is iterated so that the capacity between the areas is maximized and the mechanism itself helps to relieve grid congestion. The addition of flow between the areas gives the LMPs a new equilibrium point, which is balanced when taking the transfer capacity into account, LMP forecasting is then possible. The proposed forecasting strategy is tested on the spot market of the Nord Pool.

In particular, equally weighted pooling of forecasts emerges as a simple, yet powerful technique compared with other schemes that rely on estimated combination weights, but only when there is no individual predictor that consistently outperforms its competitors. Constrained least squares regression (CLS) offers a balance between robustness against such well performing individual methods and relatively accurate forecasts, on average better than those of the individual predictors.

The marginal cost is required to supply electricity to incremental loads in case where a certain node increases power demands in a balanced power system. LMP plays an important role to maintain economic efficiency in power markets in a way that electricity flows from a low-cost area to high-cost one and the transmission network congestion is alleviated. The power market players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their desire is reflected.

"Mei J., He D., Harley R., Habetler T., Qu G.",A random forest method for real-time price forecasting in New York electricity market,2014,IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,13,"This paper mainly focuses on the real-time price forecasting in New York electricity market through random forest. Accurate forecasting is regarded as the most practical way to win power bid in today's highly competitive electricity market. Comparing with existing price forecasting methods, random forest, as a newly introduced method, will provide a price probability distribution, which will allow the users to estimate the risks of their bidding strategy and also making the results helpful for later industrial using. Furthermore, the model can adjust to the latest forecasting condition, i.e. The latest climatic, seasonal and market condition, by updating the random forest parameters with new observations. This adaptability avoids the model failure in a climatic or economic condition different from the training set.

"Wang Z., Liu F., Wu J., Wang J.",A hybrid forecasting model based on bivariate division and a backpropagation artificial neural network optimized by chaos particle swarm optimization for day-ahead electricity price,2014,Abstract and Applied Analysis,11,"In the electricity market, the electricity price plays an inevitable role. Nevertheless, accurate price forecasting, a vital factor affecting both government regulatory agencies and public power companies, remains a huge challenge and a critical problem. Determining how to address the accurate forecasting problem becomes an even more significant task in an era in which electricity is increasingly important. Based on the chaos particle swarm optimization (CPSO), the backpropagation artificial neural network (BPANN), and the idea of bivariate division, this paper proposes a bivariate division BPANN (BD-BPANN) method and the CPSO-BD-BPANN method for forecasting electricity price. The former method creatively transforms the electricity demand and price to be a new variable, named DV, which is calculated using the division principle, to forecast the day-ahead electricity by multiplying the forecasted values of the DVs and forecasted values of the demand. Next, to improve the accuracy of BD-BPANN, chaos particle swarm optimization and BD-BPANN are synthesized to form a novel model, CPSO-BD-BPANN. In this study, CPSO is utilized to optimize the initial parameters of BD-BPANN to make its output more stable than the original model. Finally, two forecasting strategies are proposed regarding different situations. © 2014 Zhilong Wang et al.",,,"4, 5",1,1,1
"Wu L., Shahidehpour M.",A hybrid model for integrated day-ahead electricity price and load forecasting in smart grid,2014,"IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution",37,"Load and price forecasting are two key issues for market participants and system operators in electricity markets. Most existing works predict load and price separately. However, a dynamic pricing type scenario is envisioned in smart grid, where consumers may have the ability to react to constantly changing price signals by shifting electricity usages from expensive hours to others, which would consequently impact electricity prices. Thus, price and load signals are strongly coupled, and previous separated forecast models may not be as effective. In this study, a two-stage integrated price and load forecasting framework is developed. The first stage provides initial price and load forecasts separately, and the second stage considers load and price interaction with initial forecasts as inputs. At each stage, a hybrid time-series and adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) model is used, in which multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average catches the linear relationship of price and load log return series, generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic unveils heteroscedastic character of residuals and AWNN presents non-linear impacts. Several criteria such as average mean absolute percentage error and error variance are used to measure the forecasting accuracy. Illustrative forecasting examples of the New York Independent System Operator market are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed method. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.",,Commerce; Costs; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Neural networks; Smart power grids; Adaptive wavelet neural network; Forecasting accuracy; Independent system operators; Linear relationships; Market participants; Mean absolute percentage error; Multivariate autoregressive; Price and load forecasting; Electric load forecasting,"4, 5",1,1,1

The deregulation of electricity markets stimulated investments in the production and distribution of energy, but there are large risks associated with these investments due to price volatility. The paper in the introduction describes the algorithm that governs the operation of the Day- Ahead Market in the Italian Power Exchange and proposes an econometric model for short-term forecasting (six months or a year) of the daily Single National Price (Prezzo Unico Nazionale, PUN) of electricity. The model includes constants, regressors, moving averages, weekly and seasonal dummies, autoregressive and heteroschedastic variables. The results show a significant decrease in error of the short-term forecast of the analyzed time series, in comparison with the method of linear least squares, traditionally used in literature. An analysis on the influence of different variables on PUN such as brent, solar radiation and weather has been reported.

"Carpio J., Juan J., López D.",Multivariate exponential smoothing and dynamic factor model applied to hourly electricity price analysis,2014,Technometrics,9,"Thanks to its very simple recursive computing scheme, exponential smoothing has become a popular technique to forecast time series. In this work, we show the advantages of its multivariate version and present some properties of the model, which allows us to perform a dynamic factor analysis. This analysis leads to a simple methodology to reduce the number of parameters (useful when the dimension of observations is large) via a linear transformation that decomposes the multivariate process into independent univariate exponential smoothing processes, characterized by a single smoothing parameter that goes from zero (white-noise process) to one (random walk process). A computer implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm has been built for the maximum likelihood estimation of the models. The practicality of the method is demonstrated by its application to hourly electricity price predictions in some day-ahead markets, such as Omel, Powernext, and Nord Pool markets, whose forecasts are given as examples.

MRS models offer the possibility to divide the time series into different regimes with different underlying processes. RT is a data driven technique aiming in finding a classifier that performs an average guessing for the response variable in question, which is the short term electricity spot price. We use a dataset consisting of average day ahead spot electricity prices for the MRS model. Then, we use hourly data to build the RT model. The empirical evidence supports that the regression tree approach outperforms the MRS model. We also compare the forecasting accuracy of the regression tree model by incorporating different predictors sets for electricity prices and logarithmic electricity prices.

These scenarios are most likely to be generated based on marginal predictive densities for such prices, then enhanced with a temporal dependence structure.

The forecasting skill of the proposed model is compared to that of four benchmark approaches and the well-known the generalist autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model over a three-year evaluation period. While all benchmarks are outperformed in terms of forecasting skill overall, the superiority of the semi-parametric model over the GARCH model lies in the former's ability to generate reliable quantile estimates. © 2014 by the authors.",Density forecasting; Electricity prices; Non-stationarity; Quantile regression; Stochastic processes,Costs; Decision making; Forecasting; Random processes; Regression analysis; Stochastic systems; Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Day-ahead electricity market; Density forecasting; Electricity prices; Exponential distributions; Non-stationarities; Quantile regression; Semi-parametric modeling; Power markets,4,1,1,2
"Young D., Poletti S., Browne O.",Can agent-based models forecast spot prices in electricity markets? Evidence from the New Zealand electricity market,2014,Energy Economics,11,"Modelling price formation in electricity markets is a notoriously difficult process, due to physical constraints on electricity generation and transmission, and the potential for market power. This difficulty has inspired the recent development of bottom-up agent-based algorithmic learning models of electricity markets. While these have proven quite successful in small models, few authors have attempted any validation of their model against real-world data in a more realistic model. In this paper we develop the SWEM model, where we take one of the most promising algorithms from the literature, a modified version of the Roth and Erev algorithm, and apply it to a 19-node simplification of the New Zealand electricity market. Once key variables such as water storage are accounted for, we show that our model can closely mimic short-run (weekly) electricity prices at these 19 nodes, given fundamental inputs such as fuel costs, network data, and demand. We show that agents in SWEM are able to manipulate market power when a line outage makes them an effective monopolist in the market. SWEM has already been applied to a wide variety of policy applications in the New Zealand market.22. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based modelling; Electricity markets; Power trading,Computational methods; Costs; Digital storage; Electric industry; Fuel storage; Outages; Agent-based model; Agent-based modelling; Algorithmic learning; Electricity generation; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Physical constraints; Power trading; New zealand; Spot price; Commerce; algorithm; electricity supply; energy market; forecasting method; model validation; modeling; price dynamics; electricity generation; energy policy; New Zealand,1,"1, 2",1,1

Electricity price is a very complex signal as a result of its non-linearity, non-stationarity and time-variant behaviour. This study presents a new approach to short-term electricity price forecasting. The proposed method is derived by integrating the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method with the local informative vector machine (IVM), which can be derived by combining the IVM with the local regression method. IVM is a practical probabilistic alternative to the popular support vector machine. Local prediction makes use of similar historical data patterns in the reconstructed space to train the regression algorithm. In the proposed method, KPCA is used to extract features of the inputs and obtain kernel principal components for constructing the phase space of the time series of the inputs. Then local IVM is employed to solve the price forecasting problem. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world dataset.

The proposed approached is based on the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique. The SSA is a relatively new and powerful technique in time series analysis and forecasting thanks to its well-known capabilities in extracting the main structure of the broad classes of the time series. In this study, it is shown that SSA can be employed to decompose the original electricity price series into trend, periodic and noisy components. The main part of the price series, that is, the trend and harmonic components, is reconstructed by removing the noise component from the original series. The reconstructed price series is then used for forecasting the day-ahead electricity prices. The proposed approach is evaluated by analysing and forecasting of the dayahead electricity prices in the Australian and Spanish electricity markets. The forecasting results confirm the superiority of the SSA approach compared with some of the recently published forecasting techniques. ©The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.",,Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price series; Electricity prices; Forecasting techniques; Harmonic components; Noise components; Singular spectrum analysis; Spanish electricity markets; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Forecasting; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Costs,4,1,1,1

The motivation for this research comes from a recent stream of literature in energy economics concerning electricity spot price models. While the existence of distinct regimes in such data is generally unquestionable (due to the supply stack structure), the actual goodness-of-fit of the models requires statistical validation.

In Portugal, distributed generation is paid using feed in tariffs while in Spain it can choose between receiving a regulated feed in tariff or the market price plus a participation prize. The feed in scheme is now under discussion since it is argued that it represents an excessive cost that is internalized in the end user tariffs. However, this discussion is frequently conducted without complete knowledge of the real impact of wind power on the electricity market price, since it contributes to reduce the demand on the market thus inducing a price reduction. To clarify these issues we used a long term System Dynamics based model already reported in a previous publication to estimate the long term evolution of the market price. This model was applied to the Iberian generation system using different shares of wind power capacity to quantify the impact of wind power on the day-ahead electricity market price. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity markets; Electricity price; Iberian electricity market; Long term impact; System Dynamics model; Wind power,Commerce; Distributed power generation; Electric industry; System theory; Wind power; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Iberian electricity market; Long-term impacts; System dynamics model; Costs; alternative energy; demand analysis; electricity industry; energy market; power generation; price dynamics; regulatory framework; renewable resource; wind farm; wind power; Iberian Peninsula,4,0,1,0
Cifter A.,Forecasting electricity price volatility with the Markov-switching GARCH model: Evidence from the Nordic electric power market,2013,Electric Power Systems Research,38,"In this paper, electricity price behavior in the Nordic electric power market is forecasted with both the Markov-switching generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MS-GARCH) model and a set of different volatility models. The MS-GARCH model is estimated with two regimes, representing periods of low and high volatility. This study shows that electricity price volatility is not only highly volatile but also strongly regime-dependent. The empirical results show that the MS-GARCH model enables more accurate forecasting than the standard GARCH models, according to tail loss and reality check tests for one- and multi-step ahead forecasts. The results suggest that both the electricity generation companies and consumers of electricity could carry out better price forecasts by using the proposed MS-GARCH model. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Eichler M., Türk D.",Fitting semiparametric Markov regime-switching models to electricity spot prices,2013,Energy Economics,14,"Recently regime-switching models have become the standard tool for modeling electricity prices. These models capture the main properties of electricity spot prices well but estimation of the model parameters requires computer intensive methods. Moreover, the distribution of the price spikes must be fully specified although the high volatility of the spikes makes it difficult to check such distributional assumptions. Consequently, there are a number of competing proposals for the distribution in the spike regime. As an alternative, we propose a semiparametric Markov regime-switching model that leaves the distribution under the spike regime unspecified. We show that the model parameters can be estimated by employing robust statistical techniques. This presents an alternative to the existing estimation methods that are based on computer intensive numerical maximization of the likelihood function. The model in combination with the estimation framework is easier to estimate, needs less computation time and distributional assumptions. To show its advantages we compare the proposed model with a well-established Markov regime-switching model in a simulation study. Furthermore, we apply the model to log-prices for the Australian electricity market. The results are in accordance with the results from the simulation study, indicating that the proposed model might be advantageous whenever the distribution of the spike process is not sufficiently known. The results are thus encouraging and suggest the use of our approach when modeling electricity prices and pricing derivatives. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity spot prices; Markov regime-switching; Mean-reversion; Robust estimation; Semiparametric estimation; Simulation study,Electricity spot price; Markov regime-switching; Mean-reversion; Robust estimation; Semi parametric estimation; Simulation studies; Computer simulation; Costs; Electric properties; Electricity; Estimation; Numerical methods; Parameter estimation; computer simulation; electricity generation; energy market; estimation method; Markov chain; numerical model; price dynamics; Australia,3,1,1,1
"Li X.R., Yu C.W., Ren S.Y., Chiu C.H., Meng K.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting based on panel cointegration and particle filter,2013,Electric Power Systems Research,28,"An accurate forecasting of energy price is important for generation companies (GENCOs) to develop their bidding strategies or to make investment decisions. Nowadays, day-ahead electricity market is closely associated with other commodity markets such as fuel market and emission market. Under such an environment, day-ahead electricity price is volatile and its volatility changes overtime due to the uncertainties from the multi-market. This paper proposes a two-stage hybrid model based on panel cointegration and particle filter (PCPF). Panel cointegration (PC) model, which utilizes information of both the inter-temporal dynamics and the individuality of interconnected regions, provides powerful forecasting tool for electricity price. Particle filter (PF) has achieved significant successes in tracking applications involving non-Gaussian signals and nonlinear systems. This paper has two main focuses: (1) To expand the dimension of electricity price dataset from time series to panel data so that the dynamics of interconnected regions can be analyzed simultaneously and considered as a whole. (2) Regarding the model coefficients as a time-varying process, PF is used to forecast electricity price adaptively. In the case study, the proposed PCPF model is applied to the real electricity market data of PJM in the year 2008. Promising results show clearly the superior predicting behavior of the proposed modeling. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Anbazhagan S., Kumarappan N.",Day-ahead deregulated electricity market price forecasting using recurrent neural network,2013,IEEE Systems Journal,86,"This paper proposes a recurrent neural network model for the day ahead deregulated electricity market price forecasting that could be realized using the Elman network. In a deregulated market, electricity price is influenced by many factors and exhibits a very complicated and irregular fluctuation. Both power producers and consumers need a single compact and robust price forecasting tool for maximizing their profits and utilities. In order to validate the chaotic characteristic of electricity price, an Elman network is modeled. The proposed Elman network is a single compact and robust architecture (without hybridizing the various hard and soft computing models). It has been observed that a nearly state of the art Elman network forecasting accuracy can be achieved with less computation time. The proposed Elman network approach is compared with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), mixed model, neural network, wavelet ARIMA, weighted nearest neighbors, fuzzy neural network, hybrid intelligent system, adaptive wavelet neural network, neural networks with wavelet transform, wavelet transform and a hybrid of neural networks and fuzzy logic, wavelet-ARIMA radial basis function neural networks, cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm, and wavelet transform, particle swarm optimization, and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system approaches to forecast the electricity market of mainland Spain.

A range of earlier published models for forecasting of balancing market prices, including a few extensions, is benchmarked. The models are benchmarked both for 1 h-ahead and day-ahead forecast, and both point and interval forecasts are compared. None of the benchmarked models produce informative day-ahead point forecasts, suggesting that information available before the closing of the day-ahead market is efficiently reflected in the day-ahead market price rather than the balancing market price. Evaluation of the interval forecasts reveals that models without balancing state information overestimate variance, making them unsuitable for scenario generation. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Ancillary service market; Balancing market price; Electricity markets; Electricity price scenarios; Forecasting; Regulating market,Costs; Economic and social effects; Power markets; Ancillary service markets; Balancing market; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Regulating market; Forecasting,4,1,3,"1, 2"

"Liu D., Wei Y., Yang S., Guan Z.",Electricity price forecast using combined models with adaptive weights selected and errors calibrated by hidden Markov model,2013,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,4,"A combined forecast with weights adaptively selected and errors calibrated by Hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed to model the day-ahead electricity price. Firstly several single models were built to forecast the electricity price separately. Then the validation errors from every individual model were transformed into two discrete sequences: an emission sequence and a state sequence to build the HMM, obtaining a transmission matrix and an emission matrix, representing the forecasting ability state of the individual models. The combining weights of the individual models were decided by the state transmission matrixes in HMM and the best predict sample ratio of each individual among all the models in the validation set. The individual forecasts were averaged to get the combining forecast with the weights obtained above. The residuals of combining forecast were calibrated by the possible error calculated by the emission matrix of HMM. A case study of day-ahead electricity market of Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM), USA, suggests that the proposed method outperforms individual techniques of price forecasting, such as support vector machine (SVM), generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), day-ahead modeling, and self-organized map (SOM) similar days modeling. © 2013 Da Liu et al.",,Costs; Electric load forecasting; Errors; Hidden Markov models; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Combined forecasts; Combining forecasts; Day-ahead electricity market; Forecasting ability; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Individual modeling; Self-organized map; Transmission matrix; Forecasting,"3, 4, 5","1, 2",1,1
"Voronin S., Partanen J.",Price forecasting in the day-ahead energy market by an iterative method with separate normal price and price spike frameworks,2013,Energies,32,"A forecasting methodology for prediction of both normal prices and price spikes in the day-ahead energy market is proposed. The method is based on an iterative strategy implemented as a combination of two modules separately applied for normal price and price spike predictions. The normal price module is a mixture of wavelet transform, linear AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and nonlinear neural network models. The probability of a price spike occurrence is produced by a compound classifier in which three single classification techniques are used jointly to make a decision. Combined with the spike value prediction technique, the output from the price spike module aims to provide a comprehensive price spike forecast. The overall electricity price forecast is formed as combined normal price and price spike forecasts. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated with real data from the Finnish Nord Pool Spot day-ahead energy market. The proposed method provides significant improvement in both normal price and price spike prediction accuracy compared with some of the most popular forecast techniques applied for case studies of energy markets. © 2013 by the authors.",Compound classifier; Electricity price forecasts; Hybrid methodology; Input feature selection; Price spike forecasts,Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Mathematical transformations; Power quality; Wavelet transforms; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Classification technique; Compound classifiers; Day-ahead energy markets; Electricity prices; Hybrid methodologies; Nonlinear neural networks; Price spike; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1
"Bandyopadhayay A., Roy S., Ghosh D.",Forecasting day-ahead price of electricity - A dynamic regression approach,2013,International Journal of Business Excellence,6,"The electricity market is being deregulated all over the world. Deregulation has brought in a variety of trading systems such as day-ahead trading and has also introduced high volatility of electricity prices. The large variability of price increases the risk for the market participants and forces the business houses to look for a forecasting accuracy of about ± 3%. This paper provides a method to predict next-day electricity prices using dynamic regression methodology where the price was regressed on selected demand, as well as supply side variables available in the public domain, and the error has been modelled using ARIMA / SARIMA models. The results were found to be very encouraging with MAPE lying in the range of ± 3.5% in most cases. In order to reduce the complexity associated with developing many models, a clustering methodology was used to group the different hours of the day so as to reduce the number of forecasting models to be fitted. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with single linkage was used and models for representative hours had the required level of accuracy.

"Bordignon S., Bunn D.W., Lisi F., Nan F.",Combining day-ahead forecasts for British electricity prices,2013,Energy Economics,79,"This paper considers how well the approach of combining forecasts extends to the context of electricity prices. With the increasing popularity of regime switching and time-varying parameter models for predicting power prices, the multi model and evolutionary considerations that usually support the combining of simpler time series methods may be less applicable when the individual models incorporate these features. We address this question with a backtesting analysis on British day-ahead prices. Furthermore, given the volatility of power prices and concerns about accurate forecasting under extreme price excursions, we evaluate the results using various error metrics including expected shortfall. The comparisons are furthermore carefully simulated to consider model selection uncertainty in order to realistically test the value of combining as an ex ante policy.

The CNN is composed of a few neural networks (NN) with a new data flow among its building blocks. The CNN is the forecast engine of the proposed strategy. A kind of cross-validation technique is also presented to fine-tune the adjustable parameters of the feature selection algorithm and CNN.

The model is based on Weron and Misiorek (2008) but reduced in terms of estimation parameters (from 24 sets to 1) and modified to include Nordic demand and Danish wind power as exogenous variables. We model prices across all hours in the analysis period rather than across each single hour of 24. hours. By applying three model variants on Nord Pool data, we achieve a weekly mean absolute percentage error (WMAE) of around 6-7% and an hourly mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranging from 8% to 11%. Out of sample results yields a WMAE and an hourly MAPE of around 5%. The models enable analysts and traders to forecast hourly day-ahead prices accurately. Moreover, the models are relatively straightforward and user-friendly to implement. They can be set up in any trading organization. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Autoregressive exogenous model; Nordic power market; Price forecasting,Auto regressive models; Autoregressive exogenous models; Day-ahead prices; Estimation parameters; Exogenous variables; Mean absolute percentage error; Model price; Power markets; Price forecasting; Three models; Commerce; Forecasting; Lakes; Wind power; Costs; accuracy assessment; demand analysis; economic analysis; energy market; error analysis; estimation method; forecasting method; model test; parameterization; wind power; Denmark,4,1,1,1

To this end, we consider a panel of 35 maturities and control for the economic and financial environment using equity futures prices.

Under smart grid environment, it is important for players to maximize profits and minimize risks though power markets while introducing renewable energy into grids. The time series of electricity price becomes more complicated due to the nonlinearity and uncertainties. To capture the behavior of the time series appropriately, more sophisticated methods are required to overcome them as a prediction tool. In this paper, a new method is proposed for price zone forecasting.

"Hong Y.-Y., Wu C.-P.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using a hybrid principal component analysis network,2012,Energies,35,"Bidding competition is one of the main transaction approaches in a deregulated electricity market. Locational marginal prices (LMPs) resulting from bidding competition and system operation conditions indicate electricity values at a node or in an area. The LMP reveals important information for market participants in developing their bidding strategies. Moreover,LMP is also a vital indicator for the Security Coordinator to perform market redispatch for congestion management. This paper presents a method using a principal component analysis (PCA) network cascaded with a multi-layer feedforward (MLF) network for forecasting LMPs in a day-ahead market. The PCA network extracts essential features from periodic information in the market. These features serve as inputs to the MLF network for forecasting LMPs.

"Menniti D., Scordino N., Sorrentino N.",A novel approach to forecast day-ahead electricity prices by means of neural networks using groups of similar hours,2012,International Review of Electrical Engineering,1,"Forecasting short-term electricity market prices has been the focus of several studies in recent years. Although various approaches have been examined, achieving sufficiently low forecasting errors has not always been possible. However, certain applications, such as demandside management, do not require exact values for future prices, but utilize average values as the basis for making short-term scheduling decisions. With the aim of enhancing the accuracy of the day-ahead electricity price forecasting, field records of the Italian electricity market have been correlated so as to identify a number of blocks of hours, characterized by similarity of price. This paper thus proposes an approach to forecast the day-ahead electricity prices by means of a number of Neural Networks (NNs), with such a number being equal to the number of groups of hours with similarity of price, and with each NN forecasting the mean price over the hours belonging to the related group, as previously determined. Simulation results show that the fundamental and novel contribution of identifying, firstly, the membership of an hour to a particular group of hours, clustered according to their similarity of price, and then forecasting day-ahead prices for the resulting number of groups of hours performs fairly well if compared with other forecasting techniques, either on an hourly or on an average basis, in terms of mean absolute and absolute percentage errors, as well as of variance. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.",Back propagation; Electricity market prices; Forecasting; Neural network; Time series,,5,1,1,0

However, forecasting is a rather complex task since electricity prices involve many features comparably with financial ones. Electricity markets have a highly volatile nature. They are indeed a more unpredictable than that of other commodities referred to as extreme volatile. In this paper, the two most emerging European electricity markets are considered. A preliminary analysis of the time series attests to the presence of a long range dependance behaviour. Therefore, prices processes are modelled using ARFIMA-FIGARCH under Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions. Such models are sufficiently flexible to handle the long memory phenomena often encountered in both conditional mean and conditional variance in electricity spot prices. Forecasting is subsequently performed on the basis of adequate models.

Serinaldi F.,"Distributional modeling and short-term forecasting of electricity prices by Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape",2011,Energy Economics,47,"In the context of the liberalized and deregulated electricity markets, price forecasting has become increasingly important for energy company's plans and market strategies. Within the class of the time series models that are used to perform price forecasting, the subclasses of methods based on stochastic time series and causal models commonly provide point forecasts, whereas the corresponding uncertainty is quantified by approximate or simulation-based confidence intervals. Aiming to improve the uncertainty assessment, this study introduces the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) to model the dynamically varying distribution of prices. The GAMLSS allow fitting a variety of distributions whose parameters change according to covariates via a number of linear and nonlinear relationships. In this way, price periodicities, trends and abrupt changes characterizing both the position parameter (linked to the expected value of prices), and the scale and shape parameters (related to price volatility, skewness, and kurtosis) can be explicitly incorporated in the model setup. Relying on the past behavior of the prices and exogenous variables, the GAMLSS enable the short-term (one-day ahead) forecast of the entire distribution of prices. The approach was tested on two datasets from the widely studied California Power Exchange (CalPX) market, and the less mature Italian Power Exchange (IPEX). CalPX data allow comparing the GAMLSS forecasting performance with published results obtained by different models. The study points out that the GAMLSS framework can be a flexible alternative to several linear and nonlinear stochastic models. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Electricity market price; GAMLSS models; Interval forecasting; Liberalized energy markets; Point forecasting,Electricity market; Energy markets; GAMLSS models; Interval forecasting; Point forecasting; Commerce; Computer simulation; Costs; Deregulation; Electricity; Forecasting; Statistical methods; Stochastic systems; Time series; Stochastic models; assessment method; commodity price; electricity generation; energy market; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; stochasticity; time series analysis; uncertainty analysis,4,1,1,2

The methods come from time series analysis and artificial intelligence disciplines, and include univariate, multivariate, linear and nonlinear. Within the univariate methods, the double seasonal ARIMA and the recently proposed exponential smoothing for double seasonality are compared and used as benchmarks. They allow us to quantify the improvement on price forecasting when including explanatory variables or using more complex models. Dynamic regression models including the electricity load forecast are then considered. Their good performance in price forecasting has been pointed out by many authors. However, we find evidences of their predictive accuracy can be significantly outperformed by accounting the wind generation forecast provided by the System Operator. Moreover, these forecasts can be even more accurate if changes of price's behavior according with the day of the week are taken into account by means of periodic models. The last of the tested methods are feed-forward neural networks used as multivariate nonlinear regression methods with universal function approximation capabilities. The influence of the wind generation forecast on price prediction is also proved with this approach. Detailed out-of-sample results of the tested methods are given. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

With comprehensive considerations of the fluctuation rules and the various influencing factors on the forming of price in the power market, a short-term electricity price forecasting method based on the time series ARMAX model was chosen in this paper. Aimed to solve the problem with traditional method of parameter identification which is easy to fall into the local least values and has low identification precision, chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm was proposed in this paper. Calculation example shows that this method can reflect the law of the development of the electricity price well and improve forecasting accuracy greatly. © 2011 IEEE.",ARMAX model; Chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm; Short-term electricity price forecasting,ARMAX model; Chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm; Electric power industries; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Historic data; Identification precision; Influencing factor; Least value; Market operation; Power markets; Price forecasting; Short-term electricity price forecasting; Algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Forecasting; Identification (control systems); Time series; Particle swarm optimization (PSO),4,1,1,1

Although various approaches have been examined, achieving sufficiently low forecasting errors has not been always possible. However, certain applications, such as demand-side management, do not require exact values for future prices but utilize averages values as the basis for making short-term scheduling decisions.

Electricity price spikes can also have serious economical effects on the market participants. However, prediction of electricity price spikes is a complex task and most of current electricity price forecast methods focus on prediction of normal prices. In this paper, a new forecast strategy for prediction of both occurrence and value of electricity price spikes is presented. The proposed strategy has a novel feature selection technique based on information theoretic criteria to select a minimum subset of the most informative features for the forecast process. Also, the strategy includes a new closed loop prediction mechanism composed of probabilistic neural network (PNN) and hybrid neuro-evolutionary system (HNES) forecast engines. The effectiveness of the proposed forecast strategy for the prediction of both price spike occurrence and value is extensively evaluated by the real-life data of PJM (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland) electricity market.

However, price series usually have a complex behavior due to their nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variancy. In this paper, a novel hybrid method to forecast day-ahead electricity price is proposed. This hybrid method is based on wavelet transform, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFN). The wavelet transform provides a set of better-behaved constitutive series than price series for prediction. ARIMA model is used to generate a linear forecast, and then RBFN is developed as a tool for nonlinear pattern recognition to correct the estimation error in wavelet-ARIMA forecast. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the network structure which makes the RBFN be adapted to the specified training set, reducing computation complexity and avoiding overfitting.

Deregulation in the power system industry has caused rising requirement in planning, operating and controlling electric energy systems, which brings electricity load forecasting to a crucial level. Therefore, adequate techniques are desired for accurately predicting the load and hence assisting power companies in generating capacity scheduling, maintenance, energy planning and procurement, etc. An accurate forecast can greatly help power distribution companies to improve their electricity marketing strategies and avoid over or under unitisation of generating capacity and therefore optimises energy prices. But, to predict the load demand in real time requires a considerable amount of efforts. This paper presents a design methodology for a short term load forecasting useful for distribution companies, which are capable of interacting with users, gathering historical load data, performing a statistical analysis on the historical data and plotting graphs of the predicted load using the support vector machine (SVM).

The understanding of electric power supply as a public service is being replaced by the notion that a competitive market is a more appropriate mechanism to supply energy to consumers with high reliability and low cost [1]. A key element of the electricity sector restructuring is the establishment of a market-driven price for electricity. The pricing system of electricity plays an important role in a competitive market. In the power market, the electricity price depends on the evolution of balance between the demand for electricity and the available supply. At the same time, many other market factors also influence the electricity price, such as economic growth, weather, the power-plant mix, the prices of fuels and the strategic behavior of large players (usually on the generation side). An active, fully competitive and liquid spot market for wholesale electricity will translate the physical risk of inadequate capacity into a financial risk of high prices and place higher requirements on price forecasting. Producers and consumers rely on price-forecasting information to propose their corresponding bidding strategies. If a producer has an accurate forecast of the prices, it can develop a bidding strategy to maximize its profit. On the other hand, a consumer can make a plan to minimize his own electricity cost if an accurate price forecast is available. © 2010 IEEE.",Autoregressive moving average; Conventional wavelet neural network; Dilation and translation; Lolac linear wavelet neural network,Autoregressive moving average; Bidding strategy; Competitive electricity markets; Competitive markets; Conventional wavelet neural network; Dilation and translation; Dynamic price; Economic growths; Electric power industries; Electric power supply; Electricity costs; Electricity prices; Electricity sector restructuring; Financial risks; High price; High reliability; Key elements; Lolac linear wavelet neural network; Low costs; Market economies; Market factors; Physical risks; Power markets; Price forecasting; Price forecasts; Pricing systems; Public services; Spot market; Strategic Behavior; Wholesale electricity; Commerce; Competition; Deregulation; Economics; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Electricity; Industrial electronics; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Power quality; Profitability; Robotics; Weather forecasting; Costs,"4, 5",1,1,1

Due to the day-time variations in load and thereby electrical energy price, it is wise to use different models for forecasting energy price at different hours. In this paper, three different single-hour models are used to forecast electricity price at off peak, plateau, and peak load. A 24-hour model is also used to forecast electricity price of all hours simultaneously. Analysis of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions suggests different models for each single hour model as well as the 24-hour model. The best models for off peak, plateau, and peak load are obtained to be ARIMA(1,1,1), ARIMA(2,1,1) and ARIMA(0,1,1), respectively. In addition, the time-series analyses result in an AR(2) model with 24-hour period for the 24-hour model as the most suitable model.

However, over the recent past it is argued that better volatility estimates can be obtained by using standard time series techniques on non-parametric volatility measures constructed from high-frequency intradaily returns. Liquidity in financial electricity markets has increased rapidly over the recent years, which make it possible to apply these relatively new methods for measuring market volatility. In this paper high-frequency data and the concept of realized volatility is utilized to make day ahead predictions of Nord Pool forward price volatility. Such short term volatility predictions are especially important for operators and other participants in the electricity sector. We compare the results obtained from standard time-series techniques with the more traditional GARCH-framework which utilizes daily returns. Additionally, we examine whether different approaches of decomposing the total variation into a continuous - and jump measure improves the model fit or not. The paper provides new insights to how the financial electricity market at Nord Pool works, and how we efficiently can model and make predictions of the price movements in this market. © 2010 IEEE.",Electricity forward prices; GARCH; High-frequency; Long memory; Nord pool; Realized volatility,Forward price; GARCH; High frequency HF; Long memories; Nord pool; Realized volatility; Costs; Electric industry; Electricity; Forecasting; Lakes; Time series; Commerce,4,1,1,0

In addition to the change in prices caused by the demand levels (reflected in normal interaction between supply and demand), numerous other factors affect the electricity price including the sudden surges in prices which are frequently caused by unexpected outages. This paper attempts to represent the price at any one period as a random variable which may be treated statistically. Historical price data from Singapore market (USEP) are used to study the behavior of the market price in order to identify the possible statistical distributions and then hypothesis tests are formulated and carried out to determine the theoretical distributions which are best supported by the historical data. It is shown that the raw price data may not be directly amenable to statistical representation. However, suitable processing of the data such as filtering out the extreme values or suitable regrouping of the data may be carried out to bring out the underlying statistical characteristics of the price behavior. It is shown that the market price behavior may support more than one theoretical distribution although the log normal distribution was found to fit the historical data best. ©2010 IEEE.","Competitive electricity market; Electricity price; Hypothesis testing; Statistical distributions - normal, log-normal, and weibull distributions",Competitive electricity markets; Competitive power markets; Electricity price; Electricity prices; Extreme value; Historical data; Hypothesis testing; Hypothesis tests; Log-normal distribution; Market participants; Market price; Singapore; Statistical characteristics; Statistical characterization; Statistical distribution; Statistical representations; Supply and demand; Commerce; Data processing; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Normal distribution; Random variables; Statistical tests; Statistics; Weibull distribution; Costs,4,1,1,1

"Erlwein C., Benth F.E., Mamon R.",HMM filtering and parameter estimation of an electricity spot price model,2010,Energy Economics,35,"In this paper we develop a model for electricity spot price dynamics. The spot price is assumed to follow an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with an added compound Poisson process. In this way, the model allows for mean-reversion and possible jumps. All parameters are modulated by a hidden Markov chain in discrete time. They are able to switch between different economic regimes representing the interaction of various factors. Through the application of reference probability technique, adaptive filters are derived, which in turn, provide optimal estimates for the state of the Markov chain and related quantities of the observation process. The EM algorithm is applied to find optimal estimates of the model parameters in terms of the recursive filters. We implement this self-calibrating model on a deseasonalised series of daily spot electricity prices from the Nordic exchange Nord Pool.

"Karsaz A., Mashhadi H.R., Mirsalehi M.M.",Market clearing price and load forecasting using cooperative co-evolutionary approach,2010,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,25,"The deregulation of electric power supply industries has raised many challenging problems. One of the most important ones is forecasting the market clearing price (MCP) of electricity. Decisions on various issues, such as to buy or sell electricity and to offer a transaction to the market, require accurate knowledge of the MCP. Another problem, which has also been an important issue of the traditional power systems, is load forecasting for both short and long terms. In this paper, a new forecasting method is introduced to predict the next day electricity price and load. The proposed method is based on cooperative co-evolutionary (Co-Co) approach and has been applied to the real power market. Most of the conventional forecasting methods are based on a single neural network prediction. These methods might misrepresent parts of the input-output data mapping that could have been correctly represented by cooperation of multiple networks. In this paper, a new Co-Co adaptive algorithm with adjustable connections in a recursive procedure is proposed.

"Niu D., Liu D., Wu D.D.",A soft computing system for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2010,Applied Soft Computing Journal,47,"Hourly energy prices in a competitive electricity market are volatile. Forecast of energy price is key information to help producers and purchasers involved in electricity market to prepare their corresponding bidding strategies so as to maximize their profits. It is difficult to forecast all the hourly prices with only one model for different behaviors of different hourly prices. Neither will it get excellent results with 24 different models to forecast the 24 hourly prices respectively, for there are always not sufficient data to train the models, especially the peak price in summer. This paper proposes a novel technique to forecast day-ahead electricity prices based on Self-Organizing Map neural network (SOM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. SOM is used to cluster the data automatically according to their similarity to resolve the problem of insufficient training data. SVM models for regression are built on the categories clustered by SOM separately. Parameters of the SVM models are chosen by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automatically to avoid the arbitrary parameters decision of the tester, improving the forecasting accuracy. The comparison suggests that SOM-SVM-PSO has considerable value in forecasting day-ahead price in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market, especially for summer peak prices. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed RNN model is done with respect to SD method and other literatures.

Error variance, one of the important performance criteria, is also calculated in order to measure robustness of the proposed RNN model. The numerical results obtained through the simulation to forecast next 24 and 72 h electricity prices show that the forecasts generated by the proposed RNN model are significantly accurate and efficient, which confirm that the proposed algorithm performs well for shortterm price forecasting.

"Vahidinasab V., Jadid S.",Bayesian neural network model to predict day-ahead electricity prices,2010,European Transactions on Electrical Power,15,"Market participants in the new competitive electricity markets find price forecasting so valuable in developing their bidding strategies. In this paper, the Bayesian neural network (BNN) approach is proposed for day-ahead prediction of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the pool based energy markets, in which to select the optimum inputs of the BNN, the correlation coefficient technique is used. LMP has a volatile and time dependent behavior. Hence, prediction of such a complex signal is a challenging task requiring a qualified forecasting tool, which not only fits well to the training data, but also can predict the stochastic behavior of unseen part of the signal. The proposed Bayesian approach to predict day-ahead electricity prices presents noteworthy advantages over the classical neural networks (NN) methods which include the avoidance of network overfitting, an indication of the degree of uncertainty in the predictions, automatic selection of an appropriate scale for network weights and, accordingly, selection of the optimal forecasting model. Examining the proposed forecast strategy on the different periods of the Pennsylvania- New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can provide more accurate results than the other price forecasting techniques, such as, ARIMA time series, wavelet-ARIMA, classical NN, and also a similar day method.

Demonstration of this relationship is given as a test case for the Western Danish price area of the Nord Pool's Elspot market. Impact on the average price behavior is investigated as well as that on the distributional properties of the price. By using a non-parametric regression model to assess the effects of wind power forecasts on the average behavior, the non-linearities and time variations in the relationship are captured well and the effects are shown to be quite substantial. Furthermore, by evaluating the distributional properties of the spot prices under different scenarios, the impact of the wind power forecasts on the price distribution is proven to be considerable. The conditional price distribution is moreover shown to be non-Gaussian. This implies that forecasting models for electricity spot prices for which parameters are estimated by a least squares techniques will not have Gaussian residuals. Hence the widespread assumption of Gaussian residuals from electricity spot price models is shown to be inadequate for these model types.

In this context, this paper proposes the use of Data-Mining techniques to predict the short-term electricity price in the Brazilian market. In Brazil, the market model adopted has unique characteristics with a centralized form of dispatch due to the predominance of hydro generation. To apply the proposed prediction model, all features of the Brazilian electricity market are considered, such as the transmission restrictions among geo-electrical regions and the price dependency with storage energy in reservoirs. In the proposed prediction model, the electricity price is the dependent variable and the monthly time series data sets from the Brazilian system (such as power load, stored energy and thermal generation) are the independent variables. First, clustering of the data samples is performed to group similar behavior of the attributes. After that, a decision tree algorithm is applied to extract if-then rules from database. The rules obtained allow the identification of attributes that most influence the short-term electricity price. Results show that the proposed model can be an attractive tool to all electricity market players to forecast the short-term electricity price and mitigate the risks in purchasing power. © 2009 IEEE.",Clustering; Data-mining; Decision trees; Short-term electricity price forecasting,Brazilian electricity markets; Brazilian system; Clustering; Clustering data; Data sample; Decision-tree algorithm; Dependent variables; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Energy markets; Hydro generation; If-then rules; Independent variables; Market model; Power load; Power markets; Prediction model; Purchasing power; Storage energy; Stored energy; Thermal generation; Time-series data; Cluster analysis; Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Mathematical models; Profitability; Time series; Electric generators,"4, 5",1,1,0
"Lei M., Feng Z.",A novel grey model to short-term electricity price forecasting for NordPool power market,2009,"Conference Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics",2,"In order to improve the forecasting precision of traditional grey model for Short-term price in competitive electricity market, a novel grey model is presented in this paper based on period-decoupled price sequence. According to the interval time of market cleaning, the historical price data are divided into 24 sequences or 48 sequences. In the proposed grey model, two kinds of price sequences, called the main sequence (MS) and the reference sequence (RS), are defined. The correlation coefficient between price sequences of adjacent time intervals is analyzed, which is more than 0.9522 obtained from the Nordpool data in 2007. Therefore, it is determined that the MS is composed of prediction-period price data, and the RS is composed of hour-before-period price data. Furthermore, considering the limitation of the least square method (LSM) used in the traditional grey model for identification the developing coefficient a and the grey input b, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is adopted instead of LSM. Thus the PSOGM (1,2) forecasting model to short-term price is founded. The historical data from the Nordpool power market is used for computing, and the numerical results demonstrate that the MAPE of PSOGM (1,2) model for short-term price rolling prediction is 5.0626% and 7.5491% for continuous forecasting, raising 3%~20% compared with traditional grey model. ©2009 IEEE.",Electrcity price forecasting; Grey model; Particle swarm optimization; Power market,Competitive electricity markets; Correlation coefficient; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting models; Forecasting precision; Grey Model; Historical data; Interval time; Least square methods; Numerical results; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Power markets; Price forecasting; Time interval; Commerce; Costs; Cybernetics; Electric load forecasting; Least squares approximations; Rapid solidification; Particle swarm optimization (PSO),4,1,1,1

"Amjady N., Keynia F.",Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by a new feature selection algorithm and cascaded neural network technique,2009,Energy Conversion and Management,43,"With the introduction of restructuring into the electric power industry, the price of electricity has become the focus of all activities in the power market. Electricity price forecast is key information for electricity market managers and participants. However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its non-linear, non-stationary, and time variant behavior. In spite of performed research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this paper, a new forecast strategy is proposed for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets. Our forecast strategy is composed of a new two stage feature selection technique and cascaded neural networks. The proposed feature selection technique comprises modified Relief algorithm for the first stage and correlation analysis for the second stage. The modified Relief algorithm selects candidate inputs with maximum relevancy with the target variable. Then among the selected candidates, the correlation analysis eliminates redundant inputs. Selected features by the two stage feature selection technique are used for the forecast engine, which is composed of 24 consecutive forecasters. Each of these 24 forecasters is a neural network allocated to predict the price of 1 h of the next day. The whole proposed forecast strategy is examined on the Spanish and Australia's National Electricity Markets Management Company (NEMMCO) and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Sensitivity analysis of NN parameters include back-propagation learning set (BP-set), learning rate (η), momentum (α) and NN learning days (dNN). Presented work is an extended version of previous work done by authors to integrate NN and similar days (SD) method for predicting day-ahead electricity prices. Similar days refer to similar price days, i.e., price data obtained from historical days. Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of similar price days. Similar days method adopts the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. The similar days parameters, i.e., time framework of similar days (d = 45 days) and number of selected similar price days (N = 5) are kept constant for all the simulated cases. Forecasting performance is carried out by choosing a day from each season of the year 2006 randomly, and for which, the NN parameters for the base case are considered as BP-set = 500, η = 0.8, α = 0.1 and dNN = 45 days. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the value of BP-set (500, 1000, 1500); η (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2), α (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and dNN (15, 30, 45 and 60 days). During the sensitivity analysis, the most favorable value of BP-set is first identified followed by that of η and α, and based on which the best value of dNN is determined. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the best value of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained when BP-set = 500, η = 0.8, α = 0.1 and dNN = 60 days for winter season, whereas for spring, summer and autumn, these values are 500, 0.6, 0.1 and 45 days, respectively.

The presented work is an extended version of previous works done by authors to integrate NN and similar days (SD) method for predicting electricity prices. Focus here is on sensitivity analysis of NN parameters while keeping the parameters same for SD to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in the PJM market. Sensitivity analysis of NN parameters include back-propagation learning set (BP-set), learning rate (η), momentum (α) and NN learning days (dN N). The SD parameters, i.e. time framework of SD (d = 45 days) and number of selected similar price days (N=5) are kept constant for all the simulated cases. Forecasting performance is carried out by choosing two different days from each season of the year 2006 and for which, the NN parameters for the base case are considered as BP-set=500, η=0.8, α=0.1 and dNN = 45 days. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the value of BP-set (500, 1000, 1500); η (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2), α (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and dNN (15, 30, 45 and 60 days). The most favorable value of BP-set is first found out from the sensitivity analysis followed by that of η and α, and based on which the best value of dNN is determined. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the best value of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained when BP-set = 500, η= 0.8, α=0.1 and dNN = 60 days for winter season.

"Redl C., Haas R., Huber C., Böhm B.",Price formation in electricity forward markets and the relevance of systematic forecast errors,2009,Energy Economics,65,"Since the liberalisation of the European electricity sector, forward and futures contracts have gained significant interest of market participants due to risk management reasons. For pricing of these contracts an important fact concerns the non-storability of electricity. In this case, according to economic theory, forward prices are related to the expected spot prices which are built on fundamental market expectations. In the following article the crucial impact parameters of forward electricity prices and the relationship between forward and future spot prices will be assessed by an empirical analysis of electricity prices at the European Energy Exchange and the Nord Pool Power Exchange. In fact, price formation in the considered markets is influenced by historic spot market prices yielding a biased forecasting power of long-term contracts. Although market and risk assessment measures of market participants and supply and demand shocks can partly explain the futures-spot bias inefficiencies in the analysed forward markets cannot be ruled out. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, electricity price is a complex signal due to its nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variant behavior. In spite of much research in this area, more accurate and robust price forecast methods are still required. In this paper, a combination of a feature selection technique and cascaded neuro-evolutionary algorithm (CNEA) is proposed for this purpose. The feature selection method is an improved version of the mutual information (MI) technique. The CNEA is composed of cascaded forecasters where each forecaster consists of a neural network (NN) and an evolutionary algorithm (EA). An iterative search procedure is also incorporated in our solution strategy to fine-tune the adjustable parameters of both the MI technique and CNEA. The price forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated by means of real data from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) and Spanish electricity markets.

"Amjady N., Hemmati M.",Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by a hybrid intelligent system,2009,European Transactions on Electrical Power,59,"Price forecasting is so valuable for both producers and consumers in the new competitive electric power markets. In this paper, a new hybrid intelligent system (HIS) is proposed for day-ahead prediction of market clearing price (MCP) in the pool-based markets. MCP has a volatile and time-dependent behavior owning many outliers. Prediction of such a complex signal is a challenging task requiring a qualified forecast tool, which not only fits well to the training data, but also can predict the stochastic behavior of the unseen part of the signal. The proposed hybrid system is composed of a real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA), cross-validation, repetitive training, and archiving techniques combined in the framework of a neural network (NN). The proposed RCGA with enhanced stochastic search capability is used for training of the NN while the cross-validation, repetitive training and archiving techniques enhances generalization capability of it. The proposed forecast strategy is examined on the different periods of the Spanish electricity market. It is shown that the method can provide more accurate results than the other price forecasting techniques such as ARIMA time series, wavelet-ARIMA, fuzzy neural network (FNN), and generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) methods.

Recent deregulation and liberalization are worldwide currents in the electric industry. The price competition was introduced in a spot market, and the price volatility is concerned because the demand side is non-elastic, and electricity differs from other general commodities. The authors firstly predict an uncertain electric power demand by using the auto-regressive model of the neural networks. The neural network is a popular feed-forward three-layer model, and the input variables of the neural networks include the historical demand, temperature, weather-related discomfort index, and the day of the week. Secondly, by using the demand forecasted and the past prices, we apply the technique for forecasting the electricity price of the next day. The utility of the proposed technique was verified by using real data of the electric power wholesale spot market.

However, the DEPF with satisfactory precision is difficult to be gained because of the violent volatility of electricity price caused by many factors. In this study, a multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks model is constructed for the DEPF in spot market of Nord Pool which is one of the most successful electrical power markets in the world. The major influencing factors are chosen by statistical methods called auto correlation function (ACF) and cross correlation function (CCF), and the standard error back-propagation algorithm is improved by using self-adaptive learning rate and self-adaptive momentum coefficient algorithm to make the training process more efficient both in global optimization and time saving. The most suitable structure of the network is determined by a trial-and-error experiment minimizing MAPE and MSRE of the network and several commonly used error indicators are employed to evaluate the goodness of fit performance of the model.

"Aggarwal S.K., Saini L.M., Kumar A.",Price forecasting using wavelet transform and LSE based mixed model in Australian electricity market,2008,International Journal of Energy Sector Management,18,"Purpose - Price forecasting is essential for risk management in deregulated electricity markets. The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid technique using wavelet transform (WT) and multiple linear regression (MLR) to forecast price profile in electricity markets. Design/methodology/approach - Price series is highly volatile and non-stationary in nature. In this work, initially complete price series has been decomposed into separate 48 half-hourly series and then these series have been categorized into different segments for price forecasting. For some segments, WT based MLR has been applied and for the other segments, simple MLR model has been applied. The model is general in nature and has been implemented for one day-ahead price forecasting in National Electricity Market (NEM) of Australia. Participants can use the technique practically, since it predicts price well before submission of bids. Findings - Forecasting performance of the proposed WT and MLR based mixed model has been compared with the three other models, an analytical model, a MLR model and an artificial neural network (ANN) based model. The proposed model was found to be better. Performance evaluation for different wavelets was performed, and it has been observed that for improving forecasting accuracy using WT, Daubechies wavelet of order two gives the best performance. Originality/value - Forecasting accuracy improvement of an established technique by incorporating time domain and wavelet domain variables of the same time series into one set has been implemented in this work. The paper also attempts to explain how non-stationarity can be removed from a non-stationary time series by applying WT after appropriate statistical investigation. Moreover, real time electricity markets are highly unpredictable and yet under investigated. The model has been applied to NEM for the same reason. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Australia; Correlation analysis; Demand forecasting; Electricity industry; Financial forecasting; Volatility,Backpropagation; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electricity; Forecasting; Fourier transforms; Marketing; Network performance; Neural networks; Risk analysis; Risk management; Time series; Wavelet transforms; Australia; Correlation analysis; Demand forecasting; Electricity industry; Financial forecasting; Volatility; Electric load forecasting,4,1,1,1

Confirming the system marginal price is the lever and core content of electricity market. At present, how to predict the system marginal price efficiently is one of the focus problems in the research of electricity market application. In the electricity market, system marginal price is not a parameter that varies according to normal rules. It not only has relations to load curve, available generation capacity, bidding mode, system and unit of the generation companies, but also is in reference to price of commodities, inflation and so on. As we can not use mathematic mode to express the diversity and randomicity of factors which reflects electricity price, it is difficult to predict electricity price accurately. In recent years, as the chaotic theory develops, especially speaking, applying chaotic theory to load forecasting offers a new tool to study the stochastic evolution of electricity price. Furthermore, people reveal the regularity that the evolution of both electricity price time series and load time series indicates the chaotic nature, which hiding in these time series themselves. It offers foundation for predicting electricity price by using phase space reconstruction. This paper analyzes the basic character of the system marginal price time series in greater depth.

"Chan K.F., Gray P., van Campen B.",A new approach to characterizing and forecasting electricity price volatility,2008,International Journal of Forecasting,45,"There is a growing need to model the dynamics of electricity spot prices. While many studies have adopted the jump-diffusion model used successfully in traditional financial markets, the distinctive features of energy prices present non-trivial challenges. In particular, electricity price series feature extreme jumps of magnitudes rarely seen in financial markets, and occurring at greater frequency. Standard parametric approaches to estimating jump-diffusion models struggle to disentangle the jump and non-jump variation. This paper explores a recently-developed approach to separating the total variation into jump and non-jump components. Using quadratic variation theory, we non-parametrically estimate jump parameters for five power markets which are known to feature some important physical differences. The unique characteristics of the jump and non-jump components of the total variation are studied for each market. Given the evidence that the two sources of variation in spot prices have distinct dynamics, the paper explores whether volatility forecasts can be improved by explicitly incorporating the jump and non-jump components of the total variation. © 2008 International Institute of Forecasters.",Bipower variation; Jumps; Quadratic variation; Realized volatility; Volatility forecast,,"3, 4",0,1,1

"Bashir Z.A., El-Hawary M.E.",Locational marginal pricing prediction in a competitve electrical market using computational intelligence,2008,Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering,1,"Deregulation has created a competitive market among power market participants, and the pricing system plays an important role. Locational marginal pricing (LMP) provides clear market signals that identify the locations where power market participants could make their decisions so as to maximize their profits. In this work, artificial neural networks (ANNs) models are used to predict hourly LMP. ANN is trained using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO aims to minimize the error function by adjusting neural network's weights and biases using a stochastic optimal search. Wavelet transformed data is fed into neural network as pre-processing stage in order to get a better price pattern that will be reliable for forecasting. The historical LMP and corresponding load demand and temperature are trained, validated and tested over a period of one season. The efficient generalization of proposed model is investigated using early stopping technique. The results were compared with neural models using conventional back-propagation (BP) algorithm and radial basis function (RBF) and yielded encouraging results. © 2008 IEEE.",Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Predicted hourly LMP; Wavelet transform,Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Data processing; Deregulation; Electric fault location; Electric load forecasting; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Image classification; Lightning; Marketing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Radial basis function networks; Technology; Vegetation; Artificial neural networks; Competitive markets; Computational intelligence; Early stopping; Electrical and computer engineering; Error functions; Load demand; Locational marginal pricing; Neural modeling; Optimal search; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Particle swarm optimization algorithms; Power markets; Pre-processing; Predicted hourly LMP; Radial-basis function; Wavelet transform; Wavelet transformed data; Neural networks,"4, 5",1,1,1

However, price signal usually has a complex behavior due to its nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variancy. In spite of all performed researches on this area in the recent years, there is still an essential need for more accurate and robust price forecast methods. In this paper, a combination of a feature selection technique and Neural Network (NN) is proposed for this purpose. The feature selection method is a modified version of the Relief algorithm, proposed for the feature selection of price forecasting. Then, by means of the most relevant, explanatory and irredundant features, a Neural Network (NN) predicts the next values of the price signal. The adjustable parameters of the whole method are fine-tuned by a cross-validation technique. The proposed method is examined on PJM electricity market, forecasting day-ahead locational marginal prices (LMPs), and compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods especially some other popular and validated feature selection techniques.

This will complicate short-term load forecasting and challenge the existing forecasting methods that are applied to a fixed-price environment. In regard to the influence of real-time electricity prices on short-term load, a model to forecast short-term load is established by combining the radial basis function (RBF) neural network with the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The model first makes use of the nonlinear approaching capacity of the RBF network to forecast the load on the prediction day with no account of the factor of electricity price, and then, based on the recent changes of the real-time price, it uses the ANFIS system to adjust the results of load forecasting obtained by RBF network.

"Vahidinasab V., Jadid S., Kazemi A.",Day-ahead price forecasting in restructured power systems using artificial neural networks,2008,Electric Power Systems Research,97,"Over the past 15 years most electricity supply companies around the world have been restructured from monopoly utilities to deregulated competitive electricity markets. Market participants in the restructured electricity markets find short-term electricity price forecasting (STPF) crucial in formulating their risk management strategies. They need to know future electricity prices as their profitability depends on them. This research project classifies and compares different techniques of electricity price forecasting in the literature and selects artificial neural networks (ANN) as a suitable method for price forecasting. To perform this task, market knowledge should be used to optimize the selection of input data for an electricity price forecasting tool. Then sensitivity analysis is used in this research to aid in the selection of the optimum inputs of the ANN and fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm is used for daily load pattern clustering. Finally, ANN with a modified Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning algorithm are implemented for forecasting prices in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market.

A detailed description of the market mechanism and regulation is used to describe how prices are determined in order to proceed with return and volatility modeling. Continuous time mean reverting and time varying mean reverting stochastic processes have been solved in discrete time processes and estimated econometrically along with ARMAX and GARCH models. It was found that GARCH model gave much better estimation and forecasting ability. Strong persistence in mean has been found giving suspicions of market inefficiency and strong incentives for arbitrage opportunities.

"Olsson M., Söder L.",Modeling real-time balancing power market prices using combined SARIMA and Markov processes,2008,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,69,This paper describes modeling of real-time balancing power market prices by using combined seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and discrete Markov processes. The combination of such processes allows generation of price series with periods where no demand for balancing power exists. The purpose of the model is simulation of prices to construct scenario trees representing possible realization of the stochastic prices. Such scenario trees can be used in planning models based on stochastic optimization to generate bid sequences to the balancing market. The spread of the prices in the tree and the shape of the scenarios are of central importance. Model parameter estimation methods reflecting the demands on scenario trees have therefore been used. The proposed model is also applied to data from the Nordic power market. The conclusion of this paper is that the developed model is appropriate for modeling real-time balancing power prices. © 2008 IEEE.,Markov processes; Power prices; SARIMA processes; Scenario generation; Time series analysis,Marketing; Markov processes; Operating costs; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Trees (mathematics); Power prices; Scenario generation; Seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average; Electric power systems,"3, 4",1,3,1

In addition, the bidding strategies of the participants are such that the relationships between price and fundamentals are non-linear and dynamic. The lack of market maturity and high complexity hinders the use of traditional statistical methodologies (e.g., regression analysis) for price forecasting. Therefore, a flexible model is needed to achieve good forecasting in OEM. This paper uses a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system in forecasting the one-day-ahead real-time peak price of the OEM.

"Pino R., Parreno J., Gomez A., Priore P.",Forecasting next-day price of electricity in the Spanish energy market using artificial neural networks,2008,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,92,"In this paper, next-day hourly forecasts are calculated for the energy price in the electricity production market of Spain. The methodology used to achieve these forecasts is based on artificial neural networks, which have been used successfully in recent years in many forecasting applications. The days to be forecast include working days as well as weekends and holidays, due to the fact that energy price has different behaviours depending on the kind of day to be forecast. Besides, energy price time series are usually composed of too many data, which could be a problem if we are looking for a short period of time to reach an adequate forecast. In this paper, a training method for artificial neural nets is proposed, which is based on making a previous selection for the multilayer perceptron (MLP) training samples, using an ART-type neural network. The MLP is then trained and finally used to calculate forecasts. These forecasts are compared to those obtained from the well-known Box-Jenkins ARIMA forecasting method. Results show that neural nets perform better than ARIMA models, especially for weekends and holidays. Both methodologies calculate more accurate forecasts-in terms of mean absolute percentage error-for working days that for weekends and holidays.

"Zhou Y., Kato M.",Spot prices modeling for JEPX and its applications,2007,CIGRE Symposium Osaka 2007: System Development and Asset Management under Restructuring,0,"All analyses of energy management start with spot prices modeling. Modeling spot prices is becoming a challenging issue under the recent power market deregulation. Generally, there are two approaches for analyzing spot prices. One is cost-based analysis, which focuses on the behavior of time-of-day marginal cost of individual generation companies and power demand. Another is market-based analysis, which mainly studies the causes of price fluctuations and the correlation of prices. This analysis usually uses stochastic approach. However, both of these approaches have weaknesses. For instance, cost-based models are typically not concerned with market data, while market-based approaches are usually not concerned with detailed generation stack production cost. In the present state of affairs, 9 electric utilities in Japan have upper hand power as a seller side in JEPX transaction substantially. Therefore, the compound generation marginal costs, especially the compound time-of-day marginal costs of 9 electric utilities, become major factors in the spot pricing mechanism in JEPX. Based on these facts, the fluctuation mechanism of electricity spot prices in JEPX depends on the supply side to a large extent. So modeling spot prices of JEPX, which consider power demand and supply structures, especially with a focus on the compound marginal generation costs in the 9 electric utilities, will work better than solely using the market model such as stochastic models, or only using the cost-based model such as traditional electric load dispatching (ELD) stack cost calculation. This paper addresses the challenge of building spot prices modeling for JEPX in the following ways: First, we propose a modified hybrid model, which can take not only cost-based issue but also market-based issue into consideration, and, at the same time, decompose the marginal cost function into an expected value division and an indeterminate division. Next, in order to represent the relationship with marginal cost and load, we apply a HILL function, which can well fit the feature of 9 utilities' compound marginal cost, and also propose a method to estimate corresponding parameters. Finally, in order to verify the model, we forecast the spot prices by using this model and compare the result with the actual JEPX data. Forecast errors are relatively small (RMS = 4.6%), which shows that the model fits well the spot pricing mechanism. The results show that the model proposed in this paper can redeem some weaknesses of the cost-based model and the market-based model, and fit the spot pricing mechanism more comprehensively. Our model will be useful in ask/bid-strategies and risk management in power trading.",Electricity market; HILL function; Hybrid model; Marginal cost; Spot price,Electricity market; Hill function; Hybrid model; Marginal costs; Spot price; Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Electric utilities; Energy management; Risk management; Cost benefit analysis,4,0,1,0

The work presented in this paper is an extended version of our previous works where we proposed the price prediction technique by using ANN, which is based on similar days method. According to similar days method, we select similar price days corresponding to forecast day based on Euclidean norm. The focus of the present paper is mainly on sensitivity analysis of similar days parameter while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the PJM electricity market. We simulated three cases by: (i) selecting two similar days parameters (load at t and price at t); (ii) selecting three similar days parameters (load at t, price at t and price at t - 1), and (iii) selecting five similar days parameters (load at t, load at t - 1, load at t + 1, price at t and price at t - 1). The next-24h price forecasts obtained from ANN based on similar days method confirm that the performance of the ANN model is better when five similar days parameters are selected, i.e., the accuracy of the method is enhanced by the addition of load at t - 1 and t + 1. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, and historical price factors are well discussed.

The challenge of spike prediction is the accuracy of the prediction that is on how a classifier can capture all spikes that would happen. Particularly precision/recall is used in the evaluation of the spike prediction. It has shown that ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) algorithm has a superior performance in prediction of price spikes compared with other existing classification algorithms such as SVM (Support Vector Machine). The experiments and the evaluation of the results have confirmed these findings. © 2007 IEEE.",Electricity market; Power system operation and planning; Price spike prediction,Costs; Learning algorithms; Support vector machines; Voltage control; Power system operation and planning; Price spike prediction; Electric utilities,5,1,1,0
"Li C., Zhang M.",Application of GARCH model in the forecasting of day-ahead electricity prices,2007,"Proceedings - Third International Conference on Natural Computation, ICNC 2007",8,"In the new deregulated electric power industry, price forecasting is becoming increasingly important for the producers and consumers to estimate and maximize their profits. A generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) methodology is presented to predict day-ahead electricity prices. For the high volatility of the electricity prices, the GARCH model is more suitable for illustrating the time series data than other forecast model adopted generally. The prediction error is assumed to be serially correlated other than independent variable with zero mean and constant variance, which can be modeled by an Auto Regressive process. Based on the initial values of the parameters of the model gained by Eviews software, Genetic arithmetic is used to optimize them to improve its performance.

This paper explores a technique of artificial neural network (ANN) model based on similar days (SD) method in order to forecast day-ahead electricity price in the PJM market. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, publicly available data acquired from the PJM Interconnection were used for training and testing the ANN. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, and historical price factors, are discussed. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed ANN model with that of forecasts obtained from similar days method is presented. Daily and weekly mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of reasonably small value and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of less than 7$MWh were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination R2 of 0.6744 between load and electricity price.

Good market-clearing price forecasting will help producers and consumers to prepare their corresponding bidding strategies so as to maximize their profits. Market-clearing price prediction is a difficult task since bidding strategies used by market participants are complicated and various uncertainties interact in an intricate way.

The parameters of the model with mean and variance specifications are estimated simultaneously by the method of approximate maximum likelihood. The methods are implemented for time series of 1,200-4,400 daily price observations in four European power markets. Apart from persistence, heteroscedasticity, and extreme observations in prices, a novel empirical finding is the importance of day-of-the-week periodicity in the autocovariance function of electricity spot prices. In particular, the very persistent daily log prices from the Nord Pool power exchange of Norway are effectively modeled by our framework, which is also extended with explanatory variables to capture supply-and-demand effects. The daily log prices of the other three electricity markets - EEX in Germany, Powernext in France, and APX in The Netherlands - are less persistent, but periodicity is also highly significant. The dynamic behavior differs from market to market and depends primarily on the method of power generation: hydro power, power generated from fossil fuels, or nuclear power.

"Karsaz A., Khaloozadeh H.",Medium term horizon market clearing price and load forecasting with an improved dual unscented Kalman filter,2007,"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation, ICCA",3,"The deregulation of electric power supply industries has raised many challenging problems. One of the most important ones is forecasting the Market Clearing Price (MCP) of electricity. Decisions on various issues, such as to buy or sell electricity and to offer a transaction to the market, require accurate knowledge of the MCP. Another problem, which has also been an important issue of the traditional power systems, is load forecasting for both short and long terms. The extended kalman filter has been widely adopted for state estimation of nonlinear systems, machine learning applications and neural network training. In the EKF, the state distribution is approximated by the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. Therefore this can introduce large errors in the load and price forecasting as two Chaotic, nonstationary and nonlinear time-series. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF), in contrast, achieves third-order accuracy, by using a minimal set of MCP and load sigma points. In this paper an improved dual unscented Kalman filter (DUKF), which estimate state and parameter simultaneously has been applied to the real New England power market. The numerical stability and more accurate predictions of our method is comparable to the EKF, and traditional neural network training methods. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the DUKF is the same order as that of the EKE. The obtained results show significant improvement in both price and load forecasting. © 2007 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Deregulation; Electric power market; Load forecasting; Price prediction; Unscented filtering,Cost accounting; Deregulation; Electric power distribution; Marketing; Electric power market; Load forecasting; Price prediction; Neural networks,5,2,1,1

The purpose of deregulation is to give consumers free choices of their electricity supply. Thus, accurate electricity pool price forecasting can provide a set of vital predicted information that helps generation, transmission and retailer participating companies to bid strategically into a deregulated electricity market in order to maximize their profits. In this article, we propose a wavelet multiscale decomposition based autoregressive approach for the prediction of one-hour ahead and one-day ahead pool price based on historical electricity pool price and predicted electricity load data. This approach is based on a multiple resolution decomposition of the signal using the non-decimated or redundant Haar à trous wavelet transform whose advantage is taking into account the asymmetric nature of the time-varying data. There is an additional computational advantage in that there is no need to re-compute the wavelet transform (wavelet coefficients) of the full signal if the electricity pool price data (time series) is regularly updated. We assess results produced by this multiscale autoregressive (MAR) method, in both linear and non-linear variants, with single resolution autoregressive (AR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) model.

"Zareipour H., Cañzares C.A., Bhattacharya K., Thomson J.",Application of public-domain market information to forecast Ontario's wholesale electricity prices,2006,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,111,"This paper evaluates the usefulness of publicly available electricity market information in forecasting the hourly Ontario energy price (HOEP). In order to do so, relevant data from Ontario and its neighboring electricity markets, namely, New York, New England, and PJM electricity markets, are investigated, and a final set of explanatory variable candidates that are available before real-time are selected. Multivariate transfer function and dynamic regression models are employed to relate HOEP behavior to the selected explanatory variable candidates. Univariate ARIMA models are also developed for the HOEP. The HOEP models are developed on the basis of two forecasting horizons, i.e., 3 h and 24 h, and forecasting performance of the multivariate models is compared with that of the univariate models. The outcomes show that the market information publicly available before real-time can be used to improve HOEP forecast accuracy to some extent; however, unusually high or low prices remain unpredictable, and hence, the available data cannot lead to significantly more accurate forecasts. Nevertheless, the generated forecasts in this paper are significantly more accurate than currently available HOEP forecasts. To analyze the relatively low accuracy of the HOEP forecasts, comparisons are made with respect to ARIMA models developed for locational marginal prices (LMPs) of Ontario's three neighboring markets, and price volatility analyses are presented. © 2006 IEEE.",Electricity markets; Price forecasting; Time series models; Volatility analysis,Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Marketing; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Transfer functions; Electricity markets; Price forecasting; Volatility analysis; Electric power systems,4,1,1,1

The MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) results show a clear increasing trend with the increase in hour ahead load and price forecasting. The sample average of MAPEs for one hour ahead price forecasts is 9.75%. This figure increases to only 20.03% for six hour ahead predictions. Similarly, the one to six hour ahead load forecast errors (MAPE) range from 0.56% to 1.30% only.

"Gareta R., Romeo L.M., Gil A.",Forecasting of electricity prices with neural networks,2006,Energy Conversion and Management,118,"During recent years, the electricity energy market deregulation has led to a new free competition situation in Europe and other countries worldwide. Generators, distributors and qualified clients have some uncertainties about the future evolution of electricity markets. In consequence, feasibility studies of new generation plants, design of new systems and energy management optimization are frequently postponed. The ability of forecasting energy prices, for instance the electricity prices, would be highly appreciated in order to improve the profitability of utility investments. The development of new simulation techniques, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), has provided a good tool to forecast time series. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the Neural Network (NN) approach can be used to forecast short term hourly electricity pool prices (for the next day and two or three days after). The NN architecture and design for prices forecasting are described in this paper. The results are tested with extensive data sets, and good agreement is found between actual data and NN results. This methodology could help to improve power plant generation capacity management and, certainly, more profitable operation in daily energy pools. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, the confidence interval of the forecasted prices is estimated assuming the residual errors are in gaussian or uniform distribution. Hourly MCP forecasting of the Californian Power Market is used as a computer example, and the comparison with conventional ARIMA approach is given.

Deregulation of the electric power industry worldwide raises many challenging issues. Under this environment there will be new tasks to be solved. In the traditional and also new structure of the power industry, accurate short and long term load forecasting have been crucial to the efficient and economic operation of the system. However in the environment of a deregulated power market, various decisions require accurate knowledge of future spot prices for electricity. To buy or sell physical electricity, to offer a transaction to the market, or to analyze security of the network are examples of transactions that can rationally be made only with an idea of future electricity prices.

Good LMP forecasting will help market participants make effective decisions when preparing offers and bids and making bilateral contracts.

This paper presents a neural network-based method for forecasting zonal LMPs by using the Decoupled Extend Kalman Filter (DEKF) with UD factorization and sequential updating. Congestion components are emphasized by forecasting differences between zonal LMPs and hub LMPs, and the hub LMPs themselves are forecasted by their logarithm to better reflect market behaviors. A method is also developed to capture system transmission outages. To overcome the unavailability of zonal loads, a method is developed to predict zonal loads based on the total load. Two neural networks are developed to forecast real-time LMPs before and after the day-ahead market is cleared.

A single neural network, however, may misrepresent part of the input-output data mapping that could have been correctly represented by different networks. The use of a ""committee machine"" composed of multiple networks can in principle alleviate such a difficulty. A major challenge for using a committee machine is to properly combine predictions from multiple networks, since the performance of individual networks is input dependent due to mapping misrepresentation. This paper presents a new method in which weighting coefficients for combining network predictions are the probabilities that individual networks capture the true input-output relationship at that prediction instant.

Specifically, we fit marginal distributions of power prices to two special classes of distributions by matching the quantile of an empirical distribution to that of a theoretical distribution. The distributions from the first class have closed form formulas for probability densities, probability distribution functions, and quantile functions, while the distributions from the second class may have extremely unbalanced tails. Having rich tail behaviors, both classes allow realistic modeling of the power price dynamics. The appealing features of this approach are that it can effectively model the heavy tail behavior of electricity prices caused by jumps and stochastic volatility and that the resulting distributions are easy to simulate. This latter feature enables us to perform both parameter estimation and derivative pricing tasks based on price data directly observed from real markets. © 2002 IEEE.",Electricity supply industry; Energy management; ISO; Mathematical model; Power markets; Power system management; Pricing; Probability distribution; Risk management; Stochastic processes,Commerce; Costs; Distribution functions; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric utilities; Energy management; Inverse problems; Mathematical models; Power markets; Probability; Random processes; Risk management; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Empirical distributions; ISO; Marginal distribution; Power system management; Probability densities; Quantile functions; Stochastic volatility; Stochastic Volatility Model; Probability distributions,4,"2, 3",1,2

"Guo J.-J., Luh P.B.",Market clearing price prediction using a committee machine with adaptive weighting coefficients,2002,Proceedings of the IEEE Power Engineering Society Transmission and Distribution Conference,12,"The use of a committee machine composed of multiple neural networks can capture more features in data and overcome the inadequacy of a single network. Different neural networks, however, may capture different features in data, and result in different inferences and predictions. Furthermore, network performance may not be constant as input features change. Without information on prediction quality of individual networks, it is difficult to appropriately combine them in a committee machine. To overcome the difficulty, insightful information called the prediction confidence is introduced and an associated method of determining adaptive weighting coefficients is developed in this paper. The key idea is that the confidence of a prediction is measured by the inverse of a prediction variance. Adaptive weighting coefficients are then derived to depend on past network performance and the confidence of current predictions. Therefore, a committee machine can properly determine coefficients according to past performance and prediction confidence of networks.

"Ni E., Luh P.B.",Forecasting power market clearing price and its discrete PDF using a Bayesian-based classification method,2001,Proceedings of the IEEE Power Engineering Society Transmission and Distribution Conference,49,"Neural network methods have been successfully used for various applications. In time series prediction problems, the regression models such as multiple layer perceptron (MLP) and the radial basis function network (RBF) are usually applied. However, they cannot predict the probability density function (PDF) that is critical for some applications. When there is noise or corrupt data in the process, these regression models could be misled, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. In this paper, a classification method combined with a simple regression model is presented to predict the discrete PDF of power market clearing prices, which is critical for many decision-makings such as optimizing bidding strategies, and is very difficult to predict because of high market uncertainties. Our basic idea is to form a number of classes by discretizing the variable to be predicted, and thus converts the time series prediction problem into a pattern classification problem. The classes are clustered based on historical data, and the input statistics (e.g., input mean and covariance matrix, etc.) corresponding to each class are obtained via clustering. Given a new input, these classes are sorted according to the posterior probabilities calculated by using the Bayes’ formula. The prediction is then generated by using an auto-regression method (AR) for the classes with high posterior probabilities. The classes are then updated after the actual output is available. The method developed can be seen as an RBF with variable structure. The posterior probabilities can be viewed as an approximation of the discrete PDF, providing valuable information for decision-makes and for what if analysis. The developed method has been used to predict the on-peak and off-peak average MCPs in the New England market. The testing results show that it outperforms the RBF network in terms of prediction accuracy and computational time.",Auto-regression; Bayes’ rule; Classification; Deregulated electric power markets; MCP prediction,Decision support systems; Electric power systems; Marketing; Multilayer neural networks; Probability density function; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Uncertain systems; Bayesian classification method; Power market clearing price; Regression model; Electric load forecasting,4,1,1,1

Almost until the end of last century, electricity supply was considered a public service and any price forecasting which was undertaken tended to be over the longer term, concerning future fuel prices and technical improvements. Nowadays, short-term forecasts have become increasingly important since the rise of the competitive electricity markets. In this new competitive framework, short-term price forecasting is required by producers and consumers to derive their bidding strategies to the electricity market. Accurate forecasting tools are essential for producers to maximize their profits, avowing profit losses over the misjudgement of future price movements, and for consumers to maximize their utilities. A three-layered feedforward neural network, trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, is used for forecasting next-week electricity prices.

"Sioshansi R., Short W.",Evaluating the impacts of real-time pricing on the usage of wind generation,2009,,153.0,"One of the impediments to large-scale use of wind generation within power systems is its nondispatchability and variable and uncertain real-time availability. Operating constraints on conventional generators such as minimum generation points, forbidden zones, and ramping limits as well as system constraints such as power flow limits and ancillary service requirements may force a system operator to curtail wind generation in order to ensure feasibility. Furthermore, the pattern of wind availability and electricity demand may not allow wind generation to be fully utilized in all hours. One solution to these issues, which could reduce these inflexibilities, is the use of real-time pricing (RTP) tariffs which can both smooth-out the diurnal load pattern in order to reduce the impact of binding unit operating and system constraints on wind utilization, and allow demand to increase in response to the availability of costless wind generation. We use and analyze a detailed unit commitment model of the Texas power system with different estimates of demand elasticities to demonstrate the potential increases in wind generation from implementing RTP. © 2009 IEEE.",Power system economics; Real-time pricing; Unit commitment; Variable renewable energy resources; Wind power generation,Ancillary service; Demand elasticities; Electricity demands; Load patterns; Non-dispatchability; Operating constraints; Power flows; Power system economics; Power systems; Real-time pricing; System constraints; System operator; Time availability; Unit commitment; Unit commitments; Variable renewable energy resources; Wind generation; Wind utilizations; Costs; Economics; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Internet protocols; Power transmission; Rapid thermal annealing; Real time systems; Wind power,,,,

"Zhao J.H., Dong Z.Y., Xu Z., Wong K.P.",A statistical approach for interval forecasting of the electricity price,2008,,124.0,"Electricity price forecasting is a difficult yet essential task for market participants in a deregulated electricity market. Rather than forecasting the value, market participants are sometimes more interested in forecasting the prediction interval of the electricity price. Forecasting the prediction interval is essential for estimating the uncertainty involved in the price and thus is highly useful for making generation bidding strategies and investment decisions. In this paper, a novel data mining-based approach is proposed to achieve two major objectives: 1) to accurately forecast the value of the electricity price series, which is widely accepted as a nonlinear time series; 2) to accurately estimate the prediction interval of the electricity price series. In the proposed approach, support vector machine (SVM) is employed to forecast the value of the price. To forecast the prediction interval, we construct a statistical model by introducing a heteroscedastic variance equation for the SVM. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is used to estimate model parameters.

"Wan C., Xu Z., Wang Y., Dong Z.Y., Wong K.P.",A hybrid approach for probabilistic forecasting of electricity price,2014,,121.0,"The electricity market plays a key role in realizing the economic prophecy of smart grids. Accurate and reliable electricity market price forecasting is essential to facilitate various decision making activities of market participants in the future smart grid environment. However, due to the nonstationarities involved in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather difficult to accurately predict MCPs in advance. The challenge is getting intensified as more and more renewable energy and other new technologies emerged in smart grids. Therefore transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts can be of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts, thus effectively supporting the decision making activities against uncertainties and risks ahead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to construct prediction intervals of MCPs with a two-stage formulation. In the first stage, extreme learning machine (ELM) is applied to estimate point forecasts of MCPs and model uncertainties involved. In the second stage, the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the noise variance.

"Khotanzad A., Zhou E., Elragal H.",A neuro-fuzzy approach to short-term load forecasting in a price-sensitive environment,2002,,108.0,"This paper presents a new approach to short-term load forecasting in a deregulated and price-sensitive environment. A real-time pricing type scenario is envisioned where energy prices could change on an hourly basis with the consumer having the ability to react to the price signal through shifting his electricity usage from expensive hours to other times when possible. The load profile under this scenario would have different characteristics compared to that of the regulated, fixed-price era. Consequently, short-term load forecasting models customized on price-insensitive (PIS) historical data of regulated era would no longer be able to perform well. In this work, a price-sensitive (PS) load forecaster is developed. This forecaster consists of two stages, an artificial neural network based PIS load forecaster followed by a fuzzy logic (FL) system that transforms the PIS load forecasts of the first stage into PS forecasts. The first stage forecaster is a widely used forecaster in industry known as ANNSTLF. For the FL system of the second stage, a genetic algorithm based approach is developed to automatically optimize the number of rules and the number and parameters of the fuzzy membership functions.

In this article a new and very easy method to compute accurate forecasts for electricity prices using mixed models is proposed. The main idea is to develop an efficient tool for one-step-ahead forecasting in the future, combining several prediction methods for which forecasting performance has been checked and compared for a span of several years. Also as a novelty, the 24 hourly time series has been modelled separately, instead of the complete time series of the prices. This allows one to take advantage of the homogeneity of these 24 time series. The purpose of this paper is to select the model that leads to smaller prediction errors and to obtain the appropriate length of time to use for forecasting. These results have been obtained by means of a computational experiment. A mixed model which combines the advantages of the two new models discussed is proposed.

"Lu X., Dong Z.Y., Li X.",Electricity market price spike forecast with data mining techniques,2005,,88.0,"Electricity market price forecast is a changeling yet very important task for electricity market managers and participants. Due to the complexity and uncertainties in the power grid, electricity prices are highly volatile and normally carry with spikes, which may be tens or even hundreds of times higher than the normal price. Such electricity spikes are very difficult to be predicted. So far, most of the research on electricity price forecast is based on the normal range electricity prices. This paper proposes a data mining based electricity price forecast framework, which can predict the normal price as well as the price spikes. The normal price can be predicted by a previously proposed wavelet and neural network based forecast model, while the spikes are forecasted based on a data mining approach. This paper focuses on the spike prediction and explores the reasons for price spikes based on the measurement of a proposed composite supply-demand balance index (SDI) and relative demand index (RDI). These indices are able to reflect the relationship among electricity demand, electricity supply and electricity reserve capacity. The proposed model is based on a mining database including market clearing price, trading hour, electricity demand, electricity supply and reserve. Bayesian classification and similarity searching techniques are used to mine the database to find out the internal relationships between electricity price spikes and these proposed. The mining results are used to form the price spike forecast model. This proposed model is able to generate forecasted price spike, level of spike and associated forecast confidence level. The model is tested with the Queensland electricity market data with promising results. Crown Copyright © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The choice of the forecasting model becomes the important influence factor on how to improve price forecasting accuracy. This paper provides a hybrid methodology that combines both autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and artificial neural network (ANN) models for predicting short-term electricity prices. This method is examined by using the data of Australian national electricity market, New South Wales, in the year 2009.

Byström H.N.E.,Extreme value theory and extremely large electricity price changes,2005,,85.0,"Nord Pool, the first multinational exchange for electricity trading, has existed since January 1996. Typical characteristics of electricity prices on Nord Pool are a very high volatility and a large number of very large, or extreme, price changes. In this paper, we look at hourly spot prices on Nord Pool and apply extreme value theory (EVT) to investigate the tails of the price change distribution. We get a good fit of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) to AR-GARCH filtered price change series, and accurate estimates as well as forecasts of extreme quantiles are produced. Generally, our results suggest EVT to be of interest to both risk managers and portfolio managers in the highly volatile electricity market. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In the first stage, a SOM network is applied to cluster the input-data set into several subsets in an unsupervised manner. Then, a group of SVMs is used to fit the training data of each subset in the second stage in a supervised way. With the trained network, one can predict straightforwardly the next-day hourly electricity prices.

"Shrivastava N.A., Panigrahi B.K.",A hybrid wavelet-ELM based short term price forecasting for electricity markets,2014,,83.0,"Accurate electricity price forecasting is a formidable challenge for market participants and managers owing to high volatility of the electricity prices. Price forecasting is also the most important management goal for market participants since it forms the basis of maximizing profits. This study investigates the performance of a novel neural network technique called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in the price forecasting problem. Keeping in view the risk associated with electricity markets with highly volatile prices, relying on a single technique is not so profitable. Therefore ELM has been coupled with the Wavelet technique to develop a hybrid model termed as WELM (wavelet based ELM) to improve the forecasting accuracy as well as reliability. In this way, the unique features of each tool are combined to capture different patterns in the data. The robustness of the model is further enhanced using the ensembling technique. Performances of the proposed models are evaluated by using data from Ontario, PJM, New York and Italian Electricity markets.

"Hong Y.-Y., Lee C.-F.",A neuro-fuzzy price forecasting approach in deregulated electricity markets,2005,,80.0,"Bidding competition is a main transaction approach in a deregulated market. Locational marginal prices (LMPs) resulting from bidding competition signal electricity values at a node or in an area.

This paper presents a method using fuzzy reasoning and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting LMPs. The fuzzy rules are used to perform the linguistic reasoning about the contingencies. The reasoning results serve as a part of inputs to the RNNs for forecasting the LMPs. The historical LMPs in the PJM market are used to test the proposed method.

Two different agents are considered in the model, namely, the distribution company (DisCo) and the owner of the DG. The former seeks the minimization of the payments incurred in attending the forecasted demand, while the latter seeks the maximization of his profit. To meet the expected demand, the DisCo has the option to purchase energy from any DG unit within its network and directly from the wholesale electricity market. A traditional distribution utility model with no competition among DG units is considered. The proposed model positions the DG owner in the outer optimization level and the DisCo in the inner one. This last optimization problem is substituted by its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, turning the bilevel programming problem into an equivalent single-level nonlinear programming problem which is solved using commercially available software.

A nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (NARX) has proven to enjoy a superior performance to capture such dependencies than other learning machines. However, it is not examined for electricity price forecasting so far. In this paper, we have employed a NARX network for forecasting electricity prices. Our prediction model is then compared with two currently used methods, namely the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and wavelet neural network. All the models are built on the reconstructed state space of market's historical data, which either improves the results or decreases the complexity of learning algorithms. Here, we also criticize the one-step ahead forecasts for electricity price that may suffer a one-term delay and we explain why the mean square error criterion does not guarantee a functional prediction result in this case.

The context is the UK market, after the reforms introduced in March 2001, analysed with an original set of price drivers reflecting economic, technical, strategic, risk, behavioural and market design effects. Models are estimated separately as daily time-series of the 48 half-hourly trading periods. All coefficients exhibit substantial intra-day variation, relating to the heterogeneity of operating plants and market design aspects. This reveals a market responding to economic fundamentals and plant operating properties, with learning and emergent financial characteristics, as well as some strategic manipulation of capacity, most effectively exercised by the more flexible plants. Using regime-switching parameters, the effects of capacity margin and inter-day capacity adjustment are elucidated, suggesting rent-seeking behaviour, despite the relatively low prices at the time.

Different scenarios in terms of wind penetration, wind forecasts, and wind curtailment are modeled in order to analyze the impact of wind power on electricity prices for different wind penetration levels and for different levels of wind power visibility and controllability. The analysis concludes that electricity price volatility increases even as electricity prices decrease with increasing wind penetration levels. The impact of wind power on price volatility is larger in the shorter term (5-min compared to hour-to-hour). The results presented show that over-forecasting wind power increases electricity prices while under-forecasting wind power reduces them. The modeling results also show that controlling wind power by allowing curtailment increases electricity prices, and for higher wind penetrations it also reduces their volatility. © 2016.",Electricity price; Production cost modeling; Wind forecasting; Wind power; Wind power curtailment,Costs; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Power control; Wind power; Electricity price volatilities; Electricity prices; Independent system operators; Production cost model; Wind forecasting; Wind penetration; Wind penetration levels; Wind power curtailments; Weather forecasting; cost analysis; electricity; numerical model; production cost; wind power; New England; United States,,,,

In this paper, a novel hybrid methodology for electricity price forecasting is introduced and applied on a set of real-world historical data taken from the New England area. The proposed approach is implemented in two steps. In the first step, a set of relevance vector machines (RVMs) is adopted, where each RVM is used for individual ahead-of-time price prediction. In the second step, individual predictions are aggregated to formulate a linear regression ensemble, whose coefficients are obtained as the solution of a single objective optimization problem. Thus, an optimal solution to the problem is found by employing the micro-genetic algorithm and the optimized ensemble is employed for computing the final price forecast. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with performance of autoregressive-moving-average and naïve forecasting methods, as well as to that taken from each individual RVM.

"Christensen T.M., Hurn A.S., Lindsay K.A.",Forecasting spikes in electricity prices,2012,,50.0,"In many electricity markets, retailers purchase electricity at an unregulated spot price and sell to consumers at a heavily regulated price. Consequently, the occurrence of spikes in the spot electricity price represents a major source of risk for retailers, and the forecasting of these price spikes is important for effective risk management. Traditional approaches to modelling electricity prices have aimed to predict the trajectory of spot prices. In contrast, this paper focuses on the prediction of price spikes. The time series of price spikes is treated as a discrete-time point process, and a nonlinear variant of the autoregressive conditional hazard model is used to model this process. The model is estimated using half-hourly data from the Australian electricity market for the period 1 March 2001 to 30 June 2007. One-step-ahead forecasts of the probability of a price spike are then generated for each half hour in the forecast period, 1 July 2007 to 30 September 2007.

"Amjady N., Daraeepour A.",Mixed price and load forecasting of electricity markets by a new iterative prediction method,2009,,48.0,"Load and price forecasting are the two key issues for the participants of current electricity markets. However, load and price of electricity markets have complex characteristics such as nonlinearity, non-stationarity and multiple seasonality, to name a few (usually, more volatility is seen in the behavior of electricity price signal). For these reasons, much research has been devoted to load and price forecast, especially in the recent years. However, previous research works in the area separately predict load and price signals. In this paper, a mixed model for load and price forecasting is presented, which can consider interactions of these two forecast processes. The mixed model is based on an iterative neural network based prediction technique. It is shown that the proposed model can present lower forecast errors for both load and price compared with the previous separate frameworks. Another advantage of the mixed model is that all required forecast features (from load or price) are predicted within the model without assuming known values for these features. So, the proposed model can better be adapted to real conditions of an electricity market. The forecast accuracy of the proposed mixed method is evaluated by means of real data from the New York and Spanish electricity markets.

"Rintamäki T., Siddiqui A.S., Salo A.",Does renewable energy generation decrease the volatility of electricity prices? An analysis of Denmark and Germany,2017,,43.0,"Although variable renewable energy (VRE) technologies with zero marginal costs decrease electricity prices, the literature is inconclusive about how the resulting shift in the supply curves impacts price volatility. Because the flexibility to respond to high peak and low off-peak prices is crucial for demand-response applications and may compensate for the losses of conventional generators caused by lower average prices, there is a need to understand how the penetration of VRE affects volatility. In this paper, we build distributed lag models with Danish and German data to estimate the impact of VRE generation on electricity price volatility. We find that in Denmark wind power decreases the daily volatility of prices by flattening the hourly price profile, but in Germany it increases the volatility because it has a stronger impact on off-peak prices. Our analysis suggests that access to flexible generation capacity and wind power generation patterns contribute to these differing impacts. Meanwhile, solar power decreases price volatility in Germany. By contrast, the weekly volatility of prices increases in both areas due to the intermittency of VRE. Thus, policy measures for facilitating the integration of VRE should be tailored to such region-specific patterns. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",EEX; Electricity price volatility; Nord Pool; Solar power; Time-series model; Wind power,Electric power generation; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Wind power; Conventional generators; Distributed lag models; Electricity price volatilities; Generation capacity; Nord Pool; Renewable energy generation; Time series modeling; Variable renewable energies; Costs; alternative energy; electricity supply; numerical model; price dynamics; renewable resource; solar power; time series; wind power; Denmark; Germany,,,,
"Haldrup N., Nielsen F.S., Nielsen M.Ø.",A vector autoregressive model for electricity prices subject to long memory and regime switching,2010,,43.0,"A regime dependent VAR model is suggested that allows long memory (fractional integration) in each of the observed regime states as well as the possibility of fractional cointegration. The model is motivated by the dynamics of electricity prices where the transmission of power is subject to occasional congestion periods. For a system of bilateral prices non-congestion means that electricity prices are identical whereas congestion makes prices depart. Hence, the joint price dynamics implies switching between a univariate price process under non-congestion and a bivariate price process under congestion. At the same time, it is an empirical regularity that electricity prices tend to show a high degree of long memory, and thus that prices may be fractionally cointegrated.Analysis of Nord Pool data shows that even though the prices are identical under non-congestion, the prices are not, in general, fractionally cointegrated in the congestion state. Hence, in most cases price convergence is a property following from regime switching rather than a conventional error correction mechanism. Finally, the suggested model is shown to deliver forecasts that are more precise compared to competing models. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Cointegration; Electricity prices; Fractional integration; Long memory; Regime switching,Cointegration; Electricity prices; Fractional integration; Long memories; Regime switching; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Lakes; Switching; Costs; cointegration analysis; commodity price; electricity; empirical analysis; error correction; forecasting method; numerical model; price determination; price dynamics; vector autoregression,,,,
"Unsihuay-Vila C., Zambroni de Souza A.C., Marangon-Lima J.W., Balestrassi P.P.",Electricity demand and spot price forecasting using evolutionary computation combined with chaotic nonlinear dynamic model,2010,,43.0,"This paper proposes a new hybrid approach based on nonlinear chaotic dynamics and evolutionary strategy to forecast electricity loads and prices. The main idea is to develop a new training or identification stage in a nonlinear chaotic dynamic based predictor. In the training stage five optimal parameters for a chaotic based predictor are searched through an optimization model based on evolutionary strategy. The objective function of the optimization model is the mismatch minimization between the multi-step-ahead forecasting of predictor and observed data such as it is done in identification problems. The first contribution of this paper is that the proposed approach is capable of capturing the complex dynamic of demand and price time series considered resulting in a more accuracy forecasting. The second contribution is that the proposed approach run on-line manner, i.e. the optimal set of parameters and prediction is executed automatically which can be used to prediction in real-time, it is an advantage in comparison with other models, where the choice of their input parameters are carried out off-line, following qualitative/experience-based recipes. A case study of load and price forecasting is presented using data from New England, Alberta, and Spain. A comparison with other methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and artificial neural network (ANN) is shown. The results show that the proposed approach provides a more accurate and effective forecasting than ARIMA and ANN methods. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Ruibal C.M., Mazumdar M.",Forecasting the mean and the variance of electricity prices in deregulated markets,2008,,42.0,"A fundamental bid-based stochastic model is presented to predict electricity hourly prices and average price in a given period. The model captures both the economic and physical aspects of the pricing process, considering two sources of uncertainty: availability of the units and demand. This work is based on three oligopoly models-Bertrand, Cournot, and supply function equilibrium (SFE) due to Rudkevich, Duckworth, and Rosen-and obtains closed form expressions for expected value and variance of electricity hourly prices and average price. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the number of firms, anticipated peak demand, and price elasticity of demand. The results show that as the number of firms in the market decreases, the expected values of prices increase by a significant amount. Variances for the Cournot model also increase, but the variances for the SFE model decrease, taking even smaller values than Bertrand's. Thus, if the Rudkevich model is an accurate representation of the electricity market, the results show that an introduction of competition may decrease the expected value of prices but the variances may actually increase. Finally, using a refinement of the model, it has been demonstrated that an accurate temperature forecast can reduce significantly the prediction error of the electricity prices. © 2007 IEEE.","Average prices; Bertrand model; Cournot model; Deregulated electricity markets; Edgeworth expansion; Electricity price variance; Electricity prices; Hourly prices; Method of cumulants; Rudkevich, Duckworth, and Rosen's formula; Stochastic load; Supply function equilibrium",Competition; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electric load management; Marketing; Stochastic models; Uncertainty analysis; Bertrand model; Cournot model; Edgeworth expansion; Electricity price variance; Method of cumulants; Supply function equilibrium; Electric rates,,,,

"Amjady N., Keynia F.",Electricity market price spike analysis by a hybrid data model and feature selection technique,2010,,40.0,"In a competitive electricity market, energy price forecasting is an important activity for both suppliers and consumers. For this reason, many techniques have been proposed to predict electricity market prices in the recent years. However, electricity price is a complex volatile signal owning many spikes. Most of electricity price forecast techniques focus on the normal price prediction, while price spike forecast is a different and more complex prediction process. Price spike forecasting has two main aspects: prediction of price spike occurrence and value. In this paper, a novel technique for price spike occurrence prediction is presented composed of a new hybrid data model, a novel feature selection technique and an efficient forecast engine. The hybrid data model includes both wavelet and time domain variables as well as calendar indicators, comprising a large candidate input set. The set is refined by the proposed feature selection technique evaluating both relevancy and redundancy of the candidate inputs. The forecast engine is a probabilistic neural network, which are fed by the selected candidate inputs of the feature selection technique and predict price spike occurrence.

"Pedregal D.J., Trapero J.R.",Electricity prices forecasting by automatic dynamic harmonic regression models,2007,,39.0,"The changes experienced by electricity markets in recent years have created the necessity for more accurate forecast tools of electricity prices, both for producers and consumers. Many methodologies have been applied to this aim, but in the view of the authors, state space models are not yet fully exploited. The present paper proposes a univariate dynamic harmonic regression model set up in a state space framework for forecasting prices in these markets. The advantages of the approach are threefold. Firstly, a fast automatic identification and estimation procedure is proposed based on the frequency domain. Secondly, the recursive algorithms applied offer adaptive predictions that compare favourably with respect to other techniques. Finally, since the method is based on unobserved components models, explicit information about trend, seasonal and irregular behaviours of the series can be extracted. This information is of great value to the electricity companies' managers in order to improve their strategies, i.e. it provides management innovations. The good forecast performance and the rapid adaptability of the model to changes in the data are illustrated with actual prices taken from the PJM interconnection in the US and for the Spanish market for the year 2002. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"Mandal P., Srivastava A.K., Park J.-W.",An effort to optimize similar days parameters for ANN-based electricity price forecasting,2009,,38.0,"This paper presents a sensitivity analysis of similar days (SD) parameters to increase the accuracy of artificial neural network (ANN) and SD-based short-term price forecasting. Work presented in this paper is an extended version of previous works done by the authors to integrate ANN and SD method for predicting electricity price. The focus here is on sensitivity analysis of SD parameters while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) (regional transmission organization in northeast America) electricity market. Several cases are simulated by choosing (a) two, (b) three, (c) four, and (d) five SD parameters to calculate the norm. In addition, sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the time framework of SD (d = 15, 30, 45, 60) and the number of selected similar price days (N = 5, 10). From sensitivity analysis, it is identified that the optimized mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained using case-c with d = 30 and N = 10. MAPE of reasonably small value, along with forecast mean square error and mean absolute error of around 2$/MWh and 1$/MWh, is obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price.

Hence, this paper proposes a new hybrid evolutionary-adaptive methodology for electricity prices forecasting in the short-term, i.e., between 24 and 168 h ahead, successfully combining mutual information, wavelet transform, evolutionary particle swarm optimization, and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. In order to determine the accuracy, competence and proficiency of the proposed methodology, results from real-world case studies using real data are presented, together with a thorough comparison considering the results obtained with previously reported forecasting tools. Not only is the accuracy an important factor, but also the computational burden is relevant in a comparative study. The results show that it is possible to reduce the uncertainty associated with electricity market prices prediction without using any exogenous data, just the historical values, thus requiring just a few seconds of computation time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Zhao J.H., Dong Z.Y., Li X.",Electricity market price spike forecasting and decision making,2007,,33.0,"Forecasting price spikes is a timely issue for the deregulated electricity market. Traditional price forecasting techniques show poor performance in handling price spikes, which usually follow a pattern different from the prices under normal market conditions. Therefore, novel approaches are required to forecast both the occurrences and values of spikes. In this paper a comprehensive study is conducted to investigate the performance of several data mining techniques for spike forecasting. Another major contribution of this paper is that a novel approach is proposed to integrate the spike forecasting process with decision-making, and to provide a comprehensive risk management tool against spikes. This approach is based on the Naïve Bayesian Classifier. The benefits/costs of possible decisions are considered in the spike forecasting process to achieve the maximum benefits from the decisions against price spikes.

Thus, there is a need of providing methodology that is able to deal with the most important features of electricity price series, which are well known for presenting not only structure in conditional mean but also time-varying conditional variances.

These common factors are jointly estimated as well as their relationship with the original vector of series, and the dynamics affecting both their conditional mean and variance. The estimation of the model is carried out under the state-space formulation.

The forecasted amount of future renewable power will not provide enough power production to meet growing demand for renewable energy; although, it will help with modernization of the energy sector and development of renewable technology and innovation. At the same time, the capacity support scheme for renewable energy may adversely affect capacity prices and become an additional burden for industrial consumers, who are already paying the cost of capacity support for conventional power plants, so-called Capacity Delivery Agreements (CDAs). This work assesses the impact of the new capacity based support scheme on capacity and electricity price formation.

"Cludius J., Forrest S., MacGill I.",Distributional effects of the Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET) through wholesale and retail electricity price impacts,2014,,26.0,"The Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET) has spurred significant investment in renewable electricity generation, notably wind power, over the past decade. This paper considers distributional implications of the RET for different energy users. Using time-series regression, we show that the increasing amount of wind energy has placed considerable downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices through the so-called merit order effect. On the other hand, RET costs are passed on to consumers in the form of retail electricity price premiums. Our findings highlight likely significant redistributive transfers between different energy user classes under current RET arrangements. In particular, some energy-intensive industries are benefiting from lower wholesale electricity prices whilst being largely exempted from contributing to the costs of the scheme. By contrast, many households are paying significant RET pass through costs whilst not necessarily benefiting from lower wholesale prices. A more equitable distribution of RET costs and benefits could be achieved by reviewing the scope and extent of industry exemptions and ensuring that methodologies to estimate wholesale price components in regulated electricity tariffs reflect more closely actual market conditions. More generally, these findings support the growing international appreciation that policy makers need to integrate distributional assessments into policy design and implementation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Distributional effects; Electricity market; Renewable energy,Cost benefit analysis; Electricity; Investments; Wind power; Distributional effects; Electricity market; Electricity tariff; Energy intensive industries; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Time-series regression; Wholesale electricity; Costs; alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy use; policy analysis; price dynamics; renewable resource; wind power; Australia,,,,

"Hu Z., Yu Y., Wang Z., Sun W., Gan D., Han Z.",Price forecasting using an integrated approach,2004,,26.0,"In this paper, a BP model for short-term price forecasting and a linear regress model for mid/long-term price forecasting are described together with forecasting results. A detailed discussion on the choice of forecast models and forecast variables is reported. A salient feature of the reported methods is that the forecast models can take into account the influence of market power on electricity prices. Specifically, a market power index, namely Must Run Ratio (MRR), is judiciously selected as an input to the price forecast models. An added advantage of presented models is that the number of required input variables can be reduced significantly without perceived loss of accuracy. The suggested methods are being utilized, by the transmission company, to forecast short-term, mid/long-term prices in Zhejiang Electricity Market. The results show that the proposed forecast models meet the basic requirement of Zhejiang electricity market operation.",BP model; Correlation analysis; Electricity market; Linear regression model; Market power; Price forecast,Computer software; Correlation methods; Costs; Electric generators; Electric loads; Electric potential; Forecasting; Game theory; Marketing; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Power transmission; Regression analysis; BP model; Correlation analysis; Electricity markets; Linear regression model; Market power; Price forecasts; Electric industry,,,,
"Madaeni S.H., Sioshansi R.",Measuring the benefits of delayed price-responsive demand in reducing wind-uncertainty costs,2013,,25.0,"Demand response has benefits in mitigating unit commitment and dispatch costs imposed on power systems by wind uncertainty and variability. We examine the effect of delays in consumers responding to price signals on the benefits of demand response in mitigating wind-uncertainty costs. Using a case study based on the ERCOT power system, we compare the cost of operating the system with forecasts of future wind availability to a best-case scenario with perfect foresight of wind. We demonstrate that wind uncertainty can impose substantive costs on the system and that demand response can eliminate more than 75% of these costs if loads respond to system conditions immediately. Otherwise, we find that with a 30-min lag in the response, nearly 72% of the value of demand response is lost. © 2013 IEEE.",Power system economics; Real-time pricing; Unit commitment; Wind forecast errors; Wind power generation,Effect of delays; Perfect foresights; Power system economics; Real time pricing; System conditions; Unit commitment; Wind forecasts; Wind uncertainties; Economics; Electric power generation; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Costs,,,,
"Mirza F.M., Bergland O.",Pass-through of wholesale price to the end user retail price in the Norwegian electricity market,2012,,24.0,"In this paper we estimate the pass-through of wholesale electricity price to the end consumer price with variable price contracts in the Norwegian electricity market using weekly data. We find substantial asymmetry when retailers pass on the impact of price changes in the wholesale market to the retail prices as price increases are transmitted more quickly than price decreases. By examining the cumulative adjustment function of price change, we identify that some dominant retailers might be exercising market power in the retail electricity market. For an average Norwegian household with variable price contract, the cost of asymmetric price pass-through due to 2.5. Øre/kWh change in the wholesale price over the complete life of pass-through in a year reaches to a high of 2.28 NOK. This cost sums up to 3.8 million NOK for all the Norwegian households on variable price contracts for one time price change. To deal with this asymmetric price setting behavior, end consumers should switch to spot price contracts and make use of ""smart grid"" technologies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Market power; Norwegian electricity market; Price asymmetry; Price pass-through; Transmission lag,Electricity market; End consumers; End users; Market Power; Price asymmetry; Price changes; Price increase; Price pass-through; Price setting; Retail electricity markets; Retail price; Smart grid; Spot price; Whole sale prices; Wholesale electricity; Wholesale markets; Commerce; Consumer behavior; Electric industry; Sales; Costs; asymmetry; consumption behavior; electricity supply; price dynamics; retailing; Norway,,,,

As a flexible tariff mechanism, making rational CPP implementation strategies and selecting suitable critical days are crucial to its successful implementation.

Furthermore, a CPP decision model which considers the interests of both customers and load serving entity (LSE) is introduced and then solved by 0-1 integer programming.

Cramton P.,Competitive bidding behavior in uniform-price auction markets,2004,,24.0,"Profit-maximizing bidding in uniform price auction markets involves bidding above marginal cost. It therefore is not surprising that such behavior is observed in electricity markets. This incentive to bid above marginal cost is not the result of coordinated action among the bidders. Rather, each bidder is independently selecting its bid to maximize profits based on its estimate of the residual demand curve it faces. The supplier bids a price for its energy capacity to optimize its marginal tradeoff between higher prices and lower quantities. Price response from either demand or other suppliers prevents the supplier from raising its bid too much. Profit maximizing bidding should be expected and encouraged by regulators. It is precisely this profit maximizing behavior that guides the market toward long-run efficient outcomes.",,Competition; Electric industry; Electric rates; Marketing; Optimization; Problem solving; Auction markets; Competitive bidding; Energy capacity; Profit maximizing bidding; Industrial economics,,,,
"Kekatos V., Giannakis G.B., Baldick R.",Grid topology identification using electricity prices,2014,,23.0,"The potential of recovering the topology of a grid using solely publicly available market data is explored here. In contemporary whole-sale electricity markets, real-time prices are typically determined by solving the network-constrained economic dispatch problem. Under a linear DC model, locational marginal prices (LMPs) correspond to the Lagrange multipliers of the linear program involved. The interesting observation here is that the matrix of spatiotemporally varying LMPs exhibits the following property: Once premultiplied by the weighted grid Laplacian, it yields a low-rank and sparse matrix. Leveraging this rich structure, a regularized maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is developed to recover the grid Laplacian from the LMPs. The convex optimization problem formulated includes low rank-and sparsity-promoting regularizers, and it is solved using a scalable algorithm.

More specifically, price variability, price jumps, long-range correlation, and non-linearity of the prices are analyzed using the available measures in the literature. For the Ontario electricity market, the prices of 10-min spinning, 10-min non-spinning, and 30-min operating reserves for the period May 1, 2002 to December 31, 2007 are analyzed. For the New York market, prices of the same reserves plus regulation service are studied for the period February 5, 2005 to December 31, 2008. For the ERCOT market, we analyze the prices of responsive reserve, regulation up and regulation down services, for the period January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009.

Four alternative sets of price forecasts are used in this study which have different levels of accuracy. The economic impact of price forecast inaccuracies is calculated by comparing the economic benefits of the GenCos in two self-scheduling scenarios. In the first scenario, electricity market price forecasts are used to optimally schedule the GenCos' next day operation. In the second scenario, perfect price forecasts, i.e., actual market prices, are used for self-scheduling of the GenCos. Two indices are utilized to quantify the differences in the economic benefits of the GenCos under the two scenarios.

"Bello A., Reneses J., Muñoz A., Delgadillo A.",Probabilistic forecasting of hourly electricity prices in the medium-term using spatial interpolation techniques,2016,,21.0,"In the context of competitive electricity markets, medium-term price forecasting is essential for market stakeholders. However, very little research has been conducted in this field, in contrast to short-term price forecasting. Previous studies of electricity price forecasting have tackled the problem of medium-term prediction using fundamental market equilibrium models with daily data, or at most, averages of groups of hours. Similarly, the limitations of point forecasts are recognized widely, but the literature dealing with probabilistic forecasts is sparse. In this study, a novel methodology for the medium-term hourly forecasting of electricity prices is proposed. This methodology is unique in the sense that it also attempts to perform punctual and probabilistic hourly predictions simultaneously. The approach consists of a nested combination of several modeling stages. The first stage consists of generating multiple scenarios of uncertain variables. In a second stage, a market equilibrium model that incorporates Monte Carlo simulation and a new definition of load levels is executed for a reduced combination of the scenarios generated. The application of spatial interpolation techniques allows us to estimate numerous feasible realizations of electricity prices from only several hundred executions of the fundamental market equilibrium model without any loss of accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is verified in a real-size electricity system that is characterized by complex price dynamics: the Spanish market. © 2015 International Institute of Forecasters",Electricity prices; Medium-term hourly prediction; Medium-term probabilistic forecasting; Monte Carlo simulation,,,,,

Besides improving forecasting, electricity retailers can meet this challenge by partly adopting the demand side of the electricity markets to the fluctuating supply side. The necessary communication infrastructure for this so-called demand side management (DSM) such as dynamic pricing are relatively well understood. However, there is little known about the economic potential of DSM for retailers to reduce price uncertainty in deregulated markets. We present the foundation of a DSM system that targets both diminishing price uncertainty and reducing total expenditures. To succeed in these goals, we integrate DSM within the Energy Informatics Framework, derive an optimal strategy for DSM decisions and design an appropriate Information System.

"Valenzuela J., Mazumdar M.",On the computation of the probability distribution of the spot market price in a deregulated electricity market,2001,,20.0,"In a deregulated electricity market, short- and long-term decisions will be based on the spot price of electricity rather than on the load. The hourly spot prices of electricity have so far shown evidence of being highly volatile. In this paper, we propose a stochastic model for the spot market price of electricity in which no historical data for the prices are required. Rather than directly modeling the price, we model the underlying stochastic processes of the marginal unit that determines the price of electricity under market competition. The deregulated market of electricity is still evolving and the set of generating units participating in a particular market can be constantly changing. A model that uses historically observed market prices may thus give inaccurate predictions. Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to collect empirical data to obtain an accurate forecast for the spot market price. Our price model represents the market by a power generation system and captures its fundamenta l stochastic characteristics. This model highlights the dependence of the price on temperature fluctuations. The model is also used to provide analytical approximations to the bivariate probability distribution of the spot prices at two different hours.",Deregulation; Electricity; Marginal unit; Monte carlo; Power generation; Production costing models; Spot price; Stochastic models,Costs; Economics; Electric loads; Electric losses; Electric power generation; Mathematical models; Probability distributions; Deregulated electricity markets; Electric utilities,,,,

Firstly, an individual TCL model on account of consumer behaviors is developed to characterize the impact of fluctuated electricity prices and different thermal comfort requirements. Secondly, a novel optimization model of heterogeneous TCLs, which can guarantee consumer satisfaction, is proposed to provide operating reserve for power systems.

Under this pricing mechanism, electricity is priced at the exanté price (calculated based on predicted demand) up to the amount consumed at the previous time period. Any deviation of the demand from the previous time period is penalized or reimbursed at the ex-post price (calculated based on actual demand, after consumption). It is assumed that the exanté and ex-post prices are calculated based on the aggregate consumption of the population. Therefore, although an individual consumer is a price-taker, he might adjust his behavior strategically based on the mean consumption of the population. Within this class of pricing mechanisms we investigate the social welfare and price stability properties.

The daily electricity price time series is analyzed in two layers - normal behavior and spiky behavior. Two different data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle trend and seasonality in the time series. An ARMA-based model is used to catch the linear relationship between the normal range price series and the explanatory variable, a GARCH model is used to unveil the heteroscedastic character of residuals and a neural network is applied to present the nonlinear impact of the explanatory variable on electricity prices and improve predictions based on time series techniques. The probability of a price spike occurrence and the value of a price spike are produced by a Gaussian Mixture model and K-nearest neighboring model, respectively. Forecasts of normal range prices and price spikes are generated to form an overall price forecast up to one week ahead.

Breipohl A.M.,Electricity price forecasting models,2002,,17.0,"This paper proposes that the price of electricity should be parsed into two components: energy price and ""reliability price"". From the supply point of view, in addition to the energy price, there is a cost associated with reliability, or continuity of supply. This cost, which differs from other commodities, arises because electricity cannot be stored. From the demand point of view for some customers electricity is an essential commodity, while other customers may want a choice of how much reliability they are willing to pay for. If customers have the options of interruptible rates or curtailable rates, or perhaps the option of limiting demand upon receipt of a signal from the control center, then they can consume energy but not reliability, or they can only partially consume reliability. Furthermore suppliers can reduce supply costs if they can reduce demand. In the long term reduced demand reduces the need for generation capacity. Over the short term, demand reduction that is under the control of the dispatch center can reduce the demand for ancillary services.",,Customer satisfaction; Electric power systems; Electricity; Reliability; Energy prices; Electric industry,,,,
"Swinand G.P., O'Mahoney A.",Estimating the impact of wind generation and wind forecast errors on energy prices and costs in Ireland,2015,,16.0,"This paper studies the impact of wind generation on system costs and prices in Ireland. The importance of wind power and potential impacts on system costs is of interest to power system planners and policy makers globally. However, the impact of wind generation on system costs has been only studied with limited actual data from power systems with increased wind penetration. The paper uses a unique dataset of half-hourly system demand, generation, forecast and actual wind generation, along with Irish system marginal price (SMP) data from 2008 to autumn 2012. An econometric time-series model of SMP as a function of forecast and realized demand and wind generation yields results which suggest that each 1% increase in wind generation reduces SMP in Ireland by about 0.06%, while each 1% wind forecast error increases SMP about 0.02%. In absolute terms, though, at the mean the impact of wind forecast errors is small, or about 0.4€cent/MWh-wind generated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Cost function; Econometrics; Power generation economics; Power system economics; Wind power generation,Wind power; Econometrics; Energy prices; Ireland; Power generation economics; Power system economics; Wind forecasts; Wind generation; Cost functions; cost analysis; econometrics; energy planning; error analysis; forecasting method; power generation; price determination; renewable resource; wind power; Ireland,,,,
Kristiansen T.,A time series spot price forecast model for the Nord Pool market,2014,,16.0,We present three relatively simple spot price forecast models for the Nord Pool market based on historic spot and futures prices including data for inflow and reservoir levels. The models achieve a relatively accurate forecast of the weekly spot prices. The composite regression model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of around 7.5% and under-forecasts the actual spot price by some 1.4 NOK/MW h in the sample period. Out of sample testing achieves a MAPE of around 7.4% including a match of the actual spot price. A myopic model using the previous week's spot price as a predictor for the next week's spot price achieves a MAPE of 7.5% and under-forecasts the actual spot price by some 0.9 EUR/MW h. A futures model using the futures price for next week as a predictor for next week's spot price achieves a MAPE of 5.3% and over-forecast the actual spot price by some 4.3 EUR/MW h. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Bi S., Zhang Y.J.",False-data injection attack to control real-time price in electricity market,2013,,16.0,"The normal operation of electricity market requires accurate state estimation of the power grids. However, recent research shows that carefully synthesized false-data injection attacks can easily introduce errors to state estimates without being detected by the current security systems. In this paper, we analyze and formulate an effective false-data injection attack to control real-time electricity price at any tagged bus. It is observed that an adversary capable of false-data injection attack can induce false real-time electricity price by fabricating biased transmission congestion pattern. From the strategic level, we propose a simple algorithm that finds the effective congestion pattern with minor distortion to the normal system operation. For practical implementation, load redistribution attack, a special false-data injection attack which produces biased load estimates, is used to achieve the derived congestion pattern. We also propose a cost-aware neighborhood load redistribution attack, which only compromises limited measurements around the tagged bus. From theory to practice, our results here reveal the potential cyber vulnerabilities of current electricity market and would help to build more secure smart power grid in the future. © 2013 IEEE.",,Communication; Costs; Electric industry; Smart power grids; State estimation; Cyber vulnerabilities; Electricity market; Electricity prices; False-data injection attacks; Load redistribution; Normal operations; Recent researches; Transmission congestion; Security of data,,,,

The market participants are modelled as price-elastic units, price-inelastic units, and storage operators. The distributed control algorithm determines prices over a time horizon through a negotiation procedure in order to maximize social welfare while satisfying network constraints. A simple flow allocation method is used to assign responsibility for constraint violations on the network to individual units and a control rule is then used to adjust nodal prices accordingly. Such a framework is appropriate for the inclusion of aggregated household appliances or other 'virtual' market participants realized through smart grid infrastructure. Results are examined in detail for a 4-bus network and then success is demonstrated for a densely-populated 39-bus network.

The regulatory authority in Great Britain, however, believed that sometimes electricity prices were significantly higher than what was expected and, therefore, introduced price-cap regulation and divestment series. In this study, I analyze how the introduced institutional changes and regulatory reforms affected the dynamics of daily electricity prices in the England and Wales wholesale electricity market during 1990-2001.This research finds that the introduction of price-cap regulation did achieve the goal of lowering the price level at the cost of higher price volatility. Later, the first series of divestments is found to be successful at lowering price volatility, which however happens at the cost of a higher price level.

"Xiao C., Dong Z., Xu Y., Meng K., Zhou X., Zhang X.",Rational and self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine for electricity price forecast,2016,,14.0,"Electricity price forecast is of great importance to electricity market participants. Moreover, various prediction approaches based on extreme learning machine (ELM) have been identified as effective on normal decision space. Especially, evolutionary extreme learning machine (E-ELM) may obtain better solution quality. However, in high dimensional space, E-ELM is time-consuming because it is difficult to converge into optimal region when just relied on stochastic searching approaches. In addition, due to the complex functional relationship is often complicated, the objective function of E-ELM seems hard to be mined directly for obtaining useful mathematical information to guide the optimum exploring. This paper proposes a new differential evolution (DE)-like algorithm to enhance E-ELM for more accurate and reliable prediction of electricity price. The approximation model for producing DE-like trail vector is the key mechanism, which may use simpler mathematical mapping to replace the original yet complicated functional relationship within a small region. Thus, the evolutionary procedure frequently guided by rational searching directions may make the E-ELM more robust and faster than supported only by those stochastic methods. Several benchmarks are applied to test the performances of the proposed algorithm and the experimental results have shown that the new method can improve the performance of E-ELM. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Approximation model; Differential evolution; Electricity price prediction; Extreme learning machine,Benchmarking; Costs; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Functions; Knowledge acquisition; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Approximation model; Differential Evolution; Electricity prices; Extreme learning machine; Functional relationship; High dimensional spaces; Mathematical information; Stochastic searching; Learning systems,,,,

We use both high frequency (30-min) and daily datasets for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). We estimate autoregressive distributed lag models (ARDL) to decompose the merit order effect of wind and utility-scale solar PV generation over time and across states. We find that an extra GW of dispatched wind capacity decreases the wholesale electricity price by 11 AUD/MWh at the time of generation, while solar capacity by 14 AUD/MWh. The daily merit order effect is lower. We show that the wind merit order effect has been increasing as a function of dispatched wind capacity over time. Despite of this, wholesale electricity prices in Australia have been increasing, predominantly driven by the increase in natural gas prices.

Comparing with the existed uncertain self-scheduling approaches, the new method has twofold characteristics. First, it does not need a prediction of distribution of random variables and just requires an estimated value and the uncertain set of power price. Second, the counterpart of RO corresponding to the self-scheduling is a simple quadratic or quadratic cone programming.

The market mechanism is described by a feedback system, in which the independent system operator (ISO) interacts with generation companies (GenCOs) via proposing and responding to real-time nodal prices. The linear constrained quadratic optimal tracking problem is formulated; and the solution (nodal price sequence) is repeatedly computed by fusing the recently available information with backward manner and updated over the receding preview horizon. So that the total supply dynamically tracks the demand, the price is stationarized and each GenCO gains the maximal profit for the given price. Numeric results on a 118-bus network validate IFPC's effectiveness and flexibility on incorporating various line rating constraints as well as wind power fluctuation uncertainties. Comparative study demonstrates that IFPC outperforms the negotiated predictive dispatch but elapsing heavier computations. The irrational behavior analysis verifies the convergence to equilibrium; and speculation behavior of GenCOs in the real market is also discussed.

"Shrestha G.B., Songbo Q.",Analysis of electricity price in competitive markets a study in Singapore market,2008,,9.0,"Market participants have to deal with constantly changing electricity price in competitive electricity markets in the course of their everyday system operation. Although these prices in a particular market do exhibit some characteristics they are stochastic in nature and the prices cannot be predicted or forecasted for an individual hour. Yet, reasonable predictions or representations of such prices are very crucial for the operations of many market participants, such as Gencos. Many studies have adopted suitable statistical representation of the price in order to carry out system operation problems. However, justification for such models on the basis of real market prices is rarely found. This paper presents the initial findings of the study conducted to characterize the statistical behavior of electricity price in competitive markets. The published electricity prices from Singapore market have been used in these studies. The preliminary analysis is carried out using the price data from the first three years after the introduction deregulation in the market. It is used to identify the general behavior of the mean values of electricity price which show that it is possible to establish reasonable relationship between the market price and many system related factors. Recent historical data from the same market are used to investigate the statistical nature of the electricity price. Several statistical distribution functions are identified through the analyses of the historical price data which are likely to represent the stochastic nature of the electricity price. Graphical and statistical analyses are used for this purpose. Statistical analysis and testing have indicated that the behavior of the market price may resemble log-normal distribution.

The procedure comprises two main steps. The first step is feature extract of price feature by independent component analysis that has special effect on extracting the latent source feature. The second step is regression modeling by support vector machine training with the refined features that can realize higher-dimensional nonlinear regression with good generalization ability. In this way, the two algorithms have combined, whose advantages have been made a full use. Case studies are applied to test the proposed model. ©2008 IEEE.",,Electronics industry; Feature extraction; Food processing; Forecasting; Independent component analysis; Industrial electronics; Support vector machines; Case studies; Competitive electricity markets; Electricity pricing; Generalization ability; Hybrid algorithm; Independent components; Non-linear regression; Price forecasting; Regression modelling; Special properties; Spot markets; Electric load forecasting,,,,

"Gomez-Quiles C., Gil H.A.",Price and resource-related uncertainty in the estimation of the revenue of a wind farm,2011,,8.0,The revenue that wind farms produce is subject to the inherent uncertainty of the wind resource in the short-run and the long-term. This revenue is subject to an additional price-related uncertainty in jurisdictions where the output of the wind farms is paid at the prices cleared at the local electricity market. An econometric model is developed to estimate the risks of using limited information in the estimation of the annual revenue of a wind farm. Sensitivities that measure the influence of each uncertainty factor in the overall risks are also developed. An application example is shown by which investors or policy-makers may determine how typical wind farm capital costs may influence financial project feasibility under a predetermined risk. © 2006 IEEE.,Electricity markets; revenue; risk; wind farms,Annual revenue; Application examples; Capital costs; Econometric model; Electricity market; Limited information; Policy makers; Project feasibility; revenue; Uncertainty factors; Wind farm; wind farms; Wind resources; Costs; Electric utilities; Estimation; Farms; Risk perception; Wind power; Commerce,,,,

Accurate estimating price is the most essential task and the basis for any decision making and developing biding strategies. In this paper Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is applied to forecast electricity price. ANNs have been used successfully in many forecasting applications recently. Historical data of weighted average prices in electricity market that cleared with pay as bid settlement rule and also forecasted electricity demand are used to train neural networks (NN) model. The data for historical electricity prices are considered by two criterion of temperature and load in order to improve training. Data are categorized in to two seasonal parts of warm and cold days and also they are categorized by three loads level of low, normal and peak. To support better accuracy of estimating prices six different NN architectures are modeled for combination of the criterions, the NN also selected electricity prices of similar days in previous year. In the end, the results of forecasting prices of ANNs are compared with the results obtained from regression model.

This paper focuses on the Spanish electricity market. In order to develop a model capable of evaluating and predicting the Spanish electricity prices, we use data from January 1998 until August 2005. In addition, as one of the aims is to get short and medium term forecasts, we analyze the data in a daily and monthly basis, using different techniques.

Any prediction errors may result in higher costs to the supplier. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel, practical closed-loop pricing algorithm (PCPA). Using the closed-loop control to well coordinate the customers and the supplier, the power system can run more efficiently, resulting in both cost saving for customers and higher profit for the supplier. We prove the convergence of PCPA, i.e., a stable price can be achieved. We provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the win-win solution for both the customers and the supplier, and an upper bound of the gain. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition of that the highest win for both the customers and the supplier can be achieved. Extensive simulations have shown that PCPA can outperform the existing prediction-based pricing algorithms.

Three price series were selected: (1) the Nord Pool market clearing price, (2) western Denmark's area spot price (DK1), and (3) Finland's (FI) area spot price. Data were drawn for the 16 years, 2000–2015. Linear regression was used. The results showed that changes in the energy sources used to supply electricity had varying impacts, showing that average annual prices were affected more when there was a decrease in nuclear production levels rather than an increase.

Kury T.J.,Price effects of independent transmission system operators in the United States electricity market,2013,,7.0,"In 1996, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) sought to ""remove impediments to competition in the wholesale bulk power marketplace and to bring more efficient, lower cost power to the Nation's electricity consumers"" through a series of market rules. A product of these rules was the establishment of regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) charged with facilitating equal access to the transmission grid for electricity suppliers. Whether these changes in market structure have succeeded in achieving FERC's goal to provide ""lower cost power to the Nation's electricity consumers"" remains an open question. This paper utilizes a panel data set of the 48 contiguous United States and a treatment effects model in first differences to determine whether there have been changes in delivered electric prices as a result of the establishment of ISOs and RTOs. To avoid the confounding effects of electric restructuring, the model is estimated with the full panel data set, and then again without the states that have restructured their electric markets. This estimation shows that electricity prices fall approximately 4. 8 % in the first 2 years of an ISO's operation and that this result is statistically significant. However, this result is dependent on the presence of states that restructured their electricity markets. When these restructured states are removed from the data set the price effects of RTOs become indistinguishable from zero. The paper concludes that rate agreements are the principal source of the observed decrease in prices and that RTOs have not had the desired effect on electricity prices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Electricity market reform; Electricity market structure; Regional transmission organizations,,,,,

One of the important issues in this context is how to charge the users for the use of transmission facilities in the fair way and at the same time allowing the transmission utilities to recover their transmission costs. Several methodologies have been developed to recover the cost of transmission services and to estimate the power contributed by single generating unit in lines and loads. Both developed methods attempt to allocate the charge of the use of the transmission system. This paper describes certain aspects to be considered in pricing the unbundled transmission services. These aspects cover the type of transmission services, the costs related to the services and the methods used to calculate the costs of transmission services.

"Mount T., Oh H.",On the first price spike in summer,2004,,6.0,"The objective of this paper is to determine why price spikes occur in deregulated wholesale markes for electricity, and how effectively they can be mitigated by different modifications to the market.. The analysis employs a multi-agent system (MAS) to replicate a spot market with six supply firms, represented by adaptive autonomous agents,. These firms submit offers to maximize their own expected profits, and an Independent System Operator (ISO) clears the market for a predetermined load in a uniform price auction. The firms learn about the market and the behavior of their competitors by comparing actual market outcomes with predicted outcomes based on an estimate of their own residual demand curve. This estimated demand curve is updated each period using a Kalman filter. The main results for creating price spikes are 1) uncertainty about the system load is an important determinant of observed behavior (i.e. offer curves shaped like a hockey stick) that is replicated in the MAS, and 2) all firms eventually become speculators, and it is unrealistic to expect firms to behave like price takers in a market with six suppliers. The main results for mitigating high prices are 1) it is impractical to rely on more suppliers, vertically integrated firms, capacity payments or fixed contracts for power to eliminate speculative behavior, and 2) price responsive load is an effective way to mitigate high prices, particularly if some load responds at relatively low prices. Overall, the results show that a MAS can be used to evaluate a wide range of policy options and supplement the results of market tests using human subjects.",,Automatic mitigation procedures (AMP); Electricity markets; Independent system operators (ISO); Litigation; Computer simulation; Costs; Deregulation; Electric loads; Estimation; Industrial economics; Kalman filtering; Multi agent systems,,,,

"Le Coq C., Orzen H., Schwenen S.",Pricing and capacity provision in electricity markets: an experimental study,2017,,5.0,"The creation of adequate investment incentives has been of great concern in the restructuring of the electricity sector. However, to achieve this, regulators have applied different market designs across countries and regions. In this paper we employ laboratory methods to explore the relationship between market design, capacity provision and pricing in electricity markets. Subjects act as firms, choosing their generation capacity and competing in uniform price auction markets. We compare three regulatory designs: (1) a baseline price cap system that restricts scarcity rents, (2) a price spike regime that effectively lifts these restrictions, and (3) a capacity market that directly rewards the provision of capacity. Restricting price spikes leads to underinvestment. In line with the regulatory intention both alternative designs lead to sufficient investment albeit at the cost of higher energy prices during peak periods and substantial capacity payments in the capacity market regime. To some extent these results confirm theoretical expectations. However, we also find lower than predicted spot market prices as sellers compete relatively intensely in capacities and prices, and the capacity markets are less competitive than predicted. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Auctions; Electricity; Price caps; Supply function competition,,,,,
"Li L., Mendoza-Arriaga R., Mo Z., Mitchell D.",Modelling electricity prices: a time change approach,2016,,5.0,"To capture mean reversion and sharp seasonal spikes observed in electricity prices, this paper develops a new stochastic model for electricity spot prices by time changing the Jump Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (JCIR) process with a random clock that is a composite of a Gamma subordinator and a deterministic clock with seasonal activity rate. The time-changed JCIR process is a time-inhomogeneous Markov semimartingale which can be either a jump-diffusion or a pure-jump process, and it has a mean-reverting jump component that leads to mean reversion in the prices in addition to the smooth mean-reversion force. Furthermore, the characteristics of the time-changed JCIR process are seasonal, allowing spikes to occur in a seasonal pattern. The Laplace transform of the time-changed JCIR process can be efficiently computed by Gauss–Laguerre quadrature. This allows us to recover its transition density through efficient Laplace inversion and to calibrate our model using maximum likelihood estimation. To price electricity derivatives, we introduce a class of measure changes that transforms one time-changed JCIR process into another time-changed JCIR process. We derive a closed-form formula for the futures price and obtain the Laplace transform of futures option price in terms of the Laplace transform of the time-changed JCIR process, which can then be efficiently inverted to yield the option price. By fitting our model to two major electricity markets in the US, we show that it is able to capture both the trajectorial and the statistical properties of electricity prices.

For the optimization problem (formulated within the framework of nonsmooth analysis using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle), we propose a new method that uses diverse mathematical techniques (the Shooting Method, Euler's Method, the Cyclic Coordinate Descent Method).

We model long-term electricity forward prices through demand and supply of electricity, adjusted with a risk premium. Long-term prices of electricity, oil, coal, natural gas, emission allowance, imported electricity, and aluminum are modeled with a vector autoregressive model (VAR). For estimation, we use weekly prices of far-maturity forwards relevant for the Nordic electricity market. Although electricity prices experienced a few substantial shocks during the period we analyzed, there is no evidence of a structural break. Cointegration analysis reveals two stationary long-run relationships between all variables except the gas price, indicating that these variables move together over time.

The concept of smart grid has been introduced to mitigate this problem by satisfying not only real-time power demands, but also by restricting power usage within the capacity. Its consistent outperformance and new perspective in computer intelligence to control the grid for autonomous power consumption has been gradually replacing the conventional power grid. However, even in smart grid, providing high satisfaction to users often leads smart grid operator (SGO) to loss and vice versa. In this paper, we develop an optimal dynamic pricing mechanism for trading-off (ODPT), for SGOs that tradeoff between user utility and operator profit in smart grid systems. It allows the operator to purchase power from multiple energy producers and to set selling price to users dynamically following the demand-supply theory of economics. It also exploits an artificial neural network model to more accurately predict the power usage. The simulation results, carried out on a commercially available optimization modeling tool using practical power usage data, prove the effectiveness of the proposed ODPT in increasing the operator profit while satisfying user demands. © 2013 IEEE.",Dynamic power pricing; Internet of Things (IoT); operator profit; smart grid; smart grid operator (SGO); user utility,Costs; Data structures; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Green computing; Interactive computer systems; Internet of things; Neural networks; Optimization; Production; Profitability; Real time systems; Dynamic power pricing; Internet of Things (IOT); Power demands; Predictive models; Smart grid; User utility; Smart power grids,,,,
"Clements A.E., Hurn A.S., Li Z.",The effect of transmission constraints on electricity prices,2017,,4.0,"Electricity prices in an interconnected market are influenced by the occurrence of transmission constraints. Until relatively recently, however, the important effects of transmission constraints on both the trajectory and volatility of electricity prices have not played a large role in empirical models of prices. This paper explores the contribution to price volatility in the Queensland electricity market made by transmission constraints. It is found that robust estimation techniques are necessary to guard against incorrect inference in time series models using electricity price data in which severe price spikes occur. The main empirical lesson is that transmission constraints contribute significantly both to the level and variability of price and consequently the performance of a price forecasting model is likely to be improved by incorporating information on transmission constraints. While the general tenor of this conclusion will come as no surprise, the extent and the importance of these effects found in this paper for forecasting price and for computing summary measures like Value-at-Risk serve as a timely reminder to practitioners. © 2017 by the IAEE.",Price spikes; Regional electricity prices; Transmission constraints,,,,,

"Abdullah M.P., Nazar N.S.M., Hassan M.Y., Hussin F.",Optimizing time of use (ToU) electricity pricing in regulated market,2016,,4.0,"Time-of-Use (ToU) electricity price for residential consumers is receiving lots of attention lately with the increment of smart meters usage among residential customers. ToU prices reflect the actual electricity cost and the rate is commonly set base on market price of electricity. Implementing ToU pricing system on a regulated electricity system such as in Malaysia is complicated due to non existence of electricity market. The electrical utility company or the regulator will need to determine the optimum ToU prices that would give the correct price signal so that customers will react accordingly. Many factors need to be considered such as impact on electricity generation cost, load profile, load elasticity and customers’ satisfaction. This paper presents an optimization method to estimate the optimum ToU prices for given electricity demand profile and demand elasticity. The presented method able to reduce the gap between peak and off-peak demand and ensure the estimated ToU prices are fairly proportionate among hours i.e. summation of rate increments (from the fixed price) is equal to the summation of rate decrements.

"Wang J., Xiao L., Shi J.",The combination forecasting of electricity price based on price spikes processing: A case study in South Australia,2014,,4.0,"Electricity price forecasting holds very important position in the electricity market. Inaccurate price forecasting may cause energy waste and management chaos in the electricity market. However, electricity price forecasting has always been regarded as one of the largest challenges in the electricity market because it shows high volatility, which makes electricity price forecasting difficult. This paper proposes the use of artificial intelligence optimization combination forecasting models based on preprocessing data, called ""chaos particles optimization (CPSO) weight-determined combination models."" These models allow for the weight of the combined model to take values of [-1,1]. In the proposed models, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is used to identify outliers, and the outliers are replaced by a new data-produced linear interpolation function. The proposed CPSO weight-determined combination models are then used to forecast the projected future electricity price. In this case study, the electricity price data of South Australia are simulated. The results indicate that, while the weight of the combined model takes values of [-1,1], the proposed combination model can always provide adaptive, reliable, and comparatively accurate forecast results in comparison to traditional combination models. © 2014 Jianzhou Wang et al.",,,,,,
"Yang Y., Dong Y., Chen Y., Li C.","Intelligent optimized combined model based on GARCH and SVM for forecasting electricity price of New South Wales, Australia",2014,,4.0,"Daily electricity price forecasting plays an essential role in electrical power system operation and planning. The accuracy of forecasting electricity price can ensure that consumers minimize their electricity costs and make producers maximize their profits and avoid volatility. However, the fluctuation of electricity price depends on other commodities and there is a very complicated randomization in its evolution process. Therefore, in recent years, although large number of forecasting methods have been proposed and researched in this domain, it is very difficult to forecast electricity price with only one traditional model for different behaviors of electricity price. In this paper, we propose an optimized combined forecasting model by ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) based on the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and support vector machine (SVM) to improve the forecasting accuracy. First, both GARCH model and SVM are developed to forecast short-term electricity price of New South Wales in Australia. Then, ACO algorithm is applied to determine the weight coefficients. Finally, the forecasting errors by three models are analyzed and compared.

The choice of the underlying process is crucial for the simulation outcome. For power plants the core question is the existence of stable long-term cointegration relations. Therefore we investigate the impacts of different ways to model price movements in a portfolio selection model for the German electricity market. Three different approaches of modelling fuel prices are compared: initially, all prices are modelled as correlated random walks. Thereafter the coal price is modelled as random walk. The gas price follows the coal price through a mean-reversion process. Lastly, all prices are modelled as mean reversion processes with correlated residuals. The prices of electricity base and peak futures are simulated using historical correlations with gas and coal prices. Yearly base and peak prices are transformed into an estimated price duration curve followed by the steps power plant dispatch, operational margin and net present value calculation and finally the portfolio selection.

When the prices drop to minimum levels, however, (a situation called here as price depletion) the profitability of some conventional generators necessary for the supply adequacy of the system in times of low wind power production may get compromised. This work uses a probabilistic model to estimate the role that wind power is playing in the price depletion situations sometimes observed in Spain. Evidence shows that it is a balanced combination of factors what leads to this circumstance. © 2011 IEEE.",Electricity Markets; Prices; Wind Power,Electricity market; Electricity prices; Prices; Probabilistic models; Supply adequacy; Wind power production; Commerce; Drops; Electric utilities; Electricity; Profitability; Wind power; Costs,,,,

"Areekul P., Senju T., Toyama H., Chakraborty S., Yona A., Urasaki N., Mandal P., Saber A.Y.",A new method for next-day price forecasting for PJM electricity market,2010,,3.0,"In the framework of the competitive electricity markets, electricity price forecasting is important for market participants in a deregulated electricity market. Rather than forecasting the value, market participants are sometimes more interested interval of the peak electricity price forecasting. Forecasting the peak price is essential for estimating the uncertainty involved in the price and thus is highly useful for making generation bidding strategies and investment decisions. The choice of the forecasting model becomes the important influence factor how to improve price forecasting accuracy. This paper proposes new approach to reduce the prediction error at occurrence time of the peak electricity price, and aims to enhance the accuracy of the next day electricity price forecasting. In the proposed method, the weekly variation data is used for input factors of the ANN at occurrence time of the peak electricity price in order to catch the price variation. Moreover, learning data for the ANN is selected by rough sets theory at occurrence time of the peak electricity price. This method is examined by using the data of the PJM electricity market. From the simulation results, it is observed that the proposed method provides a more accurate and effective forecasting, which helpful for suitable bidding strategy and risk management tool for market participants in a deregulated electricity market.

When grey GM (1, 1) model is used in forecast, the forecast error exceeded the permitted precision. This is because GM (1, 1) model is invalidated only if the price series did not follow the rule of exponential growth. In this case, grey model with period residual modification is proposed, which inherits the advantages of grey model and makes the forecasting price curve fluctuated. Meanwhile, a series of technology is used, such as smooth processing to original data, improvement of initial condition and period residual modification. Thus the fitting curve is closer to original data and the forecasting precision is improved.

Presented work is an extended version of previous works done by authors to integrate ANN and similar days method for predicting electricity price. Focus here is on sensitivity analysis of similar days parameters while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the PJM (regional transmission organization in north-east America) electricity market. Several cases are simulated by choosing: (a) two; (b) three; (c) four; and (d) five similar days parameters to calculate the norm. Additionally, sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing time framework of similar days (d=15, 30, 45, 60) and number of selected similar price days (N=5, 10). From sensitivity analysis, it is identified that the optimized mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained using case-c with d=30 and N=10. MAPE of reasonably small value along with forecast mean square error (FMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of around 2$/MWh and 1$/MWh are obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price.

"Benaouda D., Murtagh F.",Neuro-wavelet approach to time-series signals prediction: An example of electricity load and pool-price data,2007,,3.0,"Accurate electricity load and pool-price forecasting can provide a set of vital predicted information that helps generation, transmission and retailer participating companies to bid strategically into a deregulated electricity market in order to maximize their profits and increase returns to their stakeholders. Although a number of forecasting methods have been proposed to solve the shortterm and long-term electricity load forecast, pool-price forecasting is a relatively new research area. In this article, we propose an autoregressive approach, based on a wavelet multiscale decomposition, for the prediction of one-hour ahead load and pool price based respectively on historical electricity load, and pool-price data. This approach is based on a multiple resolution decomposition of the signal using the redundant Haar à trous wavelet transform whose advantage is taking into account the asymmetric nature of the time-varying data. There is an additional computational advantage in that there is no need to re-compute the wavelet transform (wavelet coefficients) of the full signal if the electricity and pool price data (time series) is regularly updated. We assess results produced by this multiscale autoregressive method, in both linear and nonlinear variants, with single resolution autoregressive, multilayer perceptron, Elman recurrent neural network and the general regression neural network models. The input data consists of historical load and pool price data, which is collected over a period of 3 years (1999-2001), used for training, and 1 year (2002) used for testing. Experimental results are based on the New South Wales (Australia) electricity load and pool price data that is provided by the National Electricity Market Management Company.

"Yudantaka K., Kim J.-S., Song H.",Dual deep learning networks based load forecasting with partial real-time information and its application to system marginal price prediction,2019,,2.0,"Load power forecast is one of most important tasks in power systems operation and maintenance. Enhancing its accuracy can be helpful to power systems scheduling. This paper presents how to use partial real-time temperature information in forecasting load power, which is usually done using past load power and temperature data. The partial real-time temperature information means temperature information for only part of the entire prediction time interval. To this end, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is trained using past temperature and load power data in order to forecast load power, where forecasted load power depends on the temperature prediction implicitly. Then, in order to deal with the case where nontrivial temperature prediction errors happen, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network is trained using the past data describing the relation between temperature variation and load power variation. Then, the temperature is measured at the beginning of the prediction time-interval and compensated load forecast is computed by adding the output of the LSTM and that of the MLP whose input is the temperature prediction error. It is shown that the proposed compensation using the real-time temperature information indeed improves performance of load power forecast. This improved load forecast is used to predict system marginal price (SMP). The proposed method is validated using the real temperature and load power data of South Korea. © 2019 by the authors.",Load forecast; LSTM (long short-term memory); MLP (multi-layer perceptron); SMP (system marginal price) forecast,Brain; Deep learning; Electric power plant loads; Information use; Long short-term memory; Load forecast; LSTM (long short-term memory); MLP (multilayer perceptron); Multi layer perceptron; Power systems operation; System marginal price; Temperature information; Temperature prediction; Forecasting,,,,

"Arci F., Reilly J., Li P., Curran K., Belatreche A.",Forecasting short-term wholesale prices on the irish single electricity market,2018,,2.0,"Electricity markets are different from other markets as electricity generation cannot be easily stored in substantial amounts and to avoid blackouts, the generation of electricity must be balanced with customer demand for it on a second-by-second basis. Customers tend to rely on electricity for day-to-day living and cannot replace it easily so when electricity prices increase, customer demand generally does not reduce significantly in the short-term. As electricity generation and customer demand must be matched perfectly second-by-second, and because generation cannot be stored to a considerable extent, cost bids from generators must be balanced with demand estimates in advance of real-time. This paper outlines a a forecasting algorithm built on artificial neural networks to predict short-term wholesale prices on the Irish Single Electricity Market so that market participants can make more informed trading decisions.

"He J., Zhao C., Cai L., Cheng P., Shi L.",Supply and demand in smart grid: A closed-loop pricing strategy,2015,,2.0,"How to design a dynamic pricing strategy in smart grid is an important but challenging problem due to the uncertainty of customers' demand and their reaction to the price. Most of the existing pricing strategies depend on the prediction of customers' demand and their reaction to the price, thus are not robust enough due to the prediction which may cause a high cost to the supplier. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop pricing algorithm (CPA), which can largely decrease the cost and result in both costing savings for customers and higher profit for the supplier, and thus achieves a win-win solution. We provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the win-win solution for customers and the supplier. We also prove that CPA can obtain a stable price.

Prices in deficit are important parameters exogenous to the chain of models for planning the operation of electric power in Brazil, so the application of this methodology should have a positive impact on the calculation of marginal costs of operation and expansion, as well as on the calculation of the spot price. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based indeed in the relaxation and separation of a performance cost function, the coordinator computes a price vector (Lagrange Multiplier) that coordinates the global system while respecting its constraints. This vector is transmitted to the subsystems that use this information for adjusting the control policies according to the global objectives, but without total dependence on the coordinator. In particular, if this information is lost, the system can still be operative because the subsystems control strategies are computed locally. In this frame, a distributed power system is considered as an example, in which it is shown that the proposed technique indeed maintains the system in a stable operation, with the same characteristics as the case of a centralized control solution, as well as robustness under loss of information from the coordinator. © 2014 EUCA.",Decentralized Control; Model Predictive Control for Linear Systems; Power Plants,Costs; Decentralized control; Distributed computer systems; Linear systems; Model predictive control; Power plants; Predictive control systems; Centralized control; Control strategies; Distributed Model predictive Control; Distributed power systems; Handling constraints; Model predictive controllers; Power generation systems; Price-driven coordination; Lagrange multipliers,,,,

"Papler D., Bojnec Š.",Determinants of costs and prices for electricity supply in Slovenia,2012,,2.0,"This paper analyzes determinants of costs and real prices for retail electricity supply in Slovenia. We estimate cost and price functions in a retail electricity distribution enterprise in Slovenia by ordinary least square regressions on time series data. We confirm the hypotheses that real costs for electricity supply are positively and significantly associated with the costs for purchases of electric energy from electricity producers/wholesalers and with remuneration costs in electricity distribution enterprises. We did not confirm a negative association between the real costs for retail electricity supply and the proxy variable for electricity market liberalization. Market deregulation and price liberalization with increased competition have caused an initial decline in real consumer prices of electric energy. We found that the real consumer price of electric energy is positively associated with producer/wholesaler prices of electric energy, real wages in electricity distribution enterprises, and real tax expenses in the distribution enterprise, but negatively associated with the variable for electricity market liberalization. The results confirm the crucial role of the transmission of producer/wholesaler prices of electric energy and costs within the distribution enterprises, including labor costs, on the consumer prices of electric energy. © 2012 M.E.

Gutiérrez-Alcaraz G.,Dynamic pricing and area-time specific marginal capacity cost for distribution investment deferment,2011,,2.0,"Electricity deregulation makes it more feasible to apply differential rates across customers. Dynamic prices can be used to reflect the changes in marginal energy costs of a power system. Some dynamic pricing pilot projects reveal that dynamic prices can actually reduce or shift electricity usage. However, system-load peaks and local-area load peaks could occur at different times. When both peaks are coincident, two objectives can be achieved simultaneously by applying dynamic pricing: total system demand and local demand reduction. However, when these peaks are non-coincident, local demand requires investment. We propose and extended dynamic pricing scheme by taking area- and time-specific marginal distribution capacity costs into account for addressing locational investment deferral.

Vassilopoulos P.,"Price signals in ""Energy-only"" wholesale electricity markets: An empirical analysis of the price signal in France",2010,,2.0,"This paper analyzes the price signals of the French wholesale electricity market. We build a model of electricity prices that takes into account several key features of the French electricity market in order to assess the capacity of the price signal to guide investments. Wholesale prices should reflect the imbalances in the generation mix but the signal can be distorted if monopoly rents and/or ""missing money"" are present. We simulate over the 2003-2005 period theoretical perfectly competitive prices with the installed capacity and with the optimal mix to estimate the capacity imbalances and scarcity rents. We then compare the investment signal sent by observed electricity prices and the theoretical prices with the installed capacity. Although there are signs of market conte stability for the mid-merit load, through market integration with the other continental markets, observed prices are too high for the baseload and too low for the peakload, as a result distorting the signal.

"Lu X., Sugianto L.F., Lee V.",Test of asymmetry effect of demand on spot price using MCMC methods,2006,,2.0,"Analysing and forecasting spot price has become a task that cannot be overlooked since the deregulation of the electricity market in Australia. There are many factors that affect electricity spot prices. Demand, especially, as one of the fundamental drivers, plays an important role as prices are decided according to the balance of the supply and demand. Financial economists have studied the temporal relationship between price and the trading volume in most commodity markets. The relationship implies the validity of a number of hypotheses, including sequential information arrival hypothesis and the market inefficiency, in the sense that volume can be used to predict future price changes. Such research finding can be used to design trading strategy for market players. Previous studies were either mainly concentrated on price itself or the direct relationship between demand and price, if they incorporate demand into spot price forecasting. In this paper, we attempt to find out whether or not positive and negative changes in demand have the same effect on spot price. As electricity spot prices possess the characteristics of mean-reversion, stochastic volatility and occasional Jumps, we considered a mean-reverting asset pricing model that allows the conditional variance to incorporate log-stochastic volatility and a Poisson-directed jump process. Due to the complexity of the model, conventional estimation methods, such as Ordinary Least Squares, Maximum Likelihood and Quasi Maximum Likelihood, do not suit anymore. To accommodate this, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, combined with Bayesian inference, is chosen to estimate the chosen model. MCMC methods have been reported to outperform the conventional estimation methods especially in estimating asset pricing models with stochastic volatility. The data we used in this study is the peak 30-minute spot price and demand from 2001-2005 in the Victoria region, Australia. The findings should help predict future electricity spot prices and strengthen any trading strategy based on price-demand relationship. © 2006 IEEE.",Asymmetry effect; Bayesian inference; MCMC methods; Price-demand relationship; Stochastic processes; Trading strategy,Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Poisson distribution; Random processes; Asymmetry effects; Bayesian inference; Price-demand relationship; Trading strategies; Costs,,,,

Long-term marginal prices are considered the most interesting and economically sound way of allocating network costs to users. Additionally, they inherently deal with the revenue-reconciliation problem, as they generally do not require other large supplementary tariff terms.

"Muchayi M., El-Hawary M.E.",Method for optimal pricing of electric supply including transmission system considerations,1999,,2.0,"Determining real-time electricity rate structures is currently receiving a great deal of attention. In this paper, a strategy for pricing electricity supply is formulated and evaluated. Unlike other methods which use only the variation of fuel cost for generation to estimate the rate structures, the proposed pricing algorithm incorporates the optimal allocation of transmission system operating costs based on time-of-use pricing. The transmission costs are obtained by assigning a price k to each unit of power flow in the network. The assignment does not discriminate between participants located at differing parts of the network. The real-time pricing reflects the instantaneous cost of production and functions as a load management tool because this interacts with consumer behavior. The demand for power flows and transmission on an electricity supply system, like the demand for any bundle of economic goods depends upon the assigned transmission prices, together with the economic benefit to the consumer. It is assumed that there are no privately owned generating plants and that all plants and transmission lines are operated by the utility. The modeling scheme is applied to the IEEE standard 5, 14, 30 and 57 bus power systems and involves solving a modified optimal power flow problem (OPF) iteratively using the MINOS package. It is concluded that the method has a wide potential application in electricity supply pricing.",,Algorithms; Costs; Electric load flow; Electric load management; Electric power transmission; Electric power utilization; Electric rates; Fuels; Electric supply; Fuel costs; Modified optimal power flow problem; Optimal pricing; Transmission system operating costs; Transmission systems considerations; Electric power systems,,,,

The issue of long-term planning in the electric utility industry as it relates to the adoption of socially optimal spot pricing is considered. Optimal investment conditions are derived and an algorithm is developed which allows integration of these conditions into long-term planning. The proposed algorithm is an extension of Booth-Baleriaux probabilistic production costing and thus exhibits high computational efficiency. It provides the building block for incorporating spot pricing into mathematical programming methodologies used in generation expansion planning. The algorithm's usefulness to produce optimal spot price forecasts that may induce socially efficient investments in non-utility-owned generation and to facilitate empirical studies on the income distributional impact of spot price implementation is discussed.,,ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS - Planning; COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY; ELECTRICITY SPOT PRICING; INVESTMENT DECISIONS; LONG-TERM PLANNING; OPTIMAL SPOT PRICING; PRODUCTION COSTING; ELECTRIC UTILITIES,,,,

However, energy flexibility is required to cope with the increased share of renewable energy. Utilising it necessitates mathematical models of the operational response of energy flexible consumers. In this paper we present an accurate and general dynamic model of energy flexibility based on stochastic differential equations. The intuitive interpretation of the parameters is explained, to show the generality of the proposed model. To validate the approach, the parameters are estimated for three water towers and three buildings controlled by economic model predictive controllers. The model is then used to offer the energy flexibility on the current electricity market of Scandinavia, Nord Pool, using the so called “flexi orders”. Finally, the energy flexibility is used by controlling the demand of the water towers indirectly, through price signals designed based on the proposed model. Compared to having perfect foresight of electricity prices and future demand, between 63% and 98% of the potential savings were obtained in for these case studies. This shows that even without direct control of energy flexible systems, most of the potential can be reached under the current market conditions. © 2020 The Authors",Demand response; Energy flexibility; Flexibility function; State space model; Stochastic differential equations,Commerce; Differential equations; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Water towers; Electricity prices; Energy flexibility; Non-linear modelling; Perfect foresights; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Response of energy; Stochastic differential equations; Stochastic models; accuracy assessment; alternative energy; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity industry; nonlinearity; parameterization; price dynamics; stochasticity; Scandinavia,,,,

Thanks to the advances in information and communication technologies (ICT), Demand Side Management (DSM) is now possible, and promises more efficient and reliable power grids. This paper presents a study of different dynamic pricing techniques that are used as means to shape the demand in ways that minimize generation cost or maximize profit. This is achieved by using a fuzzy logic model that takes into account the different types of customers in the system. The paper further uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to generate the parameters that can achieve optimal grid operation. Results show that when customers are actively engaged in DSM schemes, and with the proper Dynamic Pricing scheme, optimal results can be obtained that benefit both the customers and the utility company, not to mention the savings in energy production and its impact on the sustainability of our cities. The results show that savings up to 12% in generation cost and a three times increase in profit can be achieved using an optimized DSM scheme. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Demand prediction; Demand side management; Fuzzy logic; Particle swarm optimization; Probabilistic model; Real-time pricing,Computer circuits; Demand side management; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Fuzzy logic; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Sales; Smart power grids; Demand prediction; Energy productions; Information and Communication Technologies; Monitor and control; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Probabilistic modeling; Real time pricing; Utility companies; Costs,,,,
"Lisin E., Kurdiukova G., Okley P., Chernova V.",Efficient methods of market pricing in power industry within the context of system integration of renewable energy sources,2019,,1.0,"Currently, the majority of world economies (even those located in the sunbelt (+/− 35 degrees of latitude with good sunshine with low seasonality) uses various types of fossil fuels as the main source of energy for their economies. However, this represents a very volatile and unsustainable strategy, since according to various estimates, the fossil fuel era will inevitably end as all carbon fuels are going to be spent in the next few centuries. Unlike traditional energy, renewable energy sources (RES) are not based on energy resources, but rather rely upon natural energy flows. With regard to its unique property, there has been an active construction of power plants of renewable energy and their gradual integration into national energy supply systems in recent decades. At the same time, the existing models of electricity markets were unprepared for their wide distribution. Hence, determination of the market value of energy generated by power plants using renewable energy sources becomes a particularly significant issue. This market value has to take into account the prevention of costs from the use of fossil fuels, as well as the resulting environmental benefits. Our paper proposes methods for solving this problem, contributing to the increase of economic efficiency of investment projects for the construction of renewable energy facilities and the formation of economic incentives for their propagation in energy supply systems. The proposed methods are based on the dynamic differentiation of tariffs for consumers with renewable energy sources depending on their structure of electricity consumption. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by calculating the cost of electricity for households located in the Krasnodar region using renewable energy sources. It is shown that this approach to the formation of tariffs for consumers allows the household to receive additional savings from the efficient use of energy installations on RES and energy storage devices in terms of alignment of the energy consumption schedule. This creates a significant incentive for households to use them and contributes to increasing the effectiveness of government renewable energy support programs, including by solving the acute problem of raising electricity tariffs from the grid. © 2019 by the authors.

"Ferreira Â.P., Ramos J.G., Fernandes P.O.",A linear regression pattern for electricity price forecasting in the Iberian electricity market,2019,,1.0,"The Iberian Market for Electricity resulted from a cooperation process developed by the Portuguese and Spanish administrations, aiming to promote the integration of the electrical systems of both countries. This common market consists of organised markets or power exchanges, and non-organised markets where bilateral over-the-counter trading takes place with or without brokers. Within this scenario, electricity price forecasts have become fundamental to the process of decision-making and strategy development by market participants. The unique characteristics of electricity prices such as non-stationarity, non-linearity and high volatility make this task very difficult. For this reason, instead of a simple time forecast, market participants are more interested in a causal forecast that is essential to estimate the uncertainty involved in the price. This work focuses on modelling the impact of various explanatory variables on the electricity price through a multiple linear regression analysis. The quality of the estimated models obtained validates the use of statistical or causal methods, such as the Multiple Linear Regression Model, as a plausible strategy to achieve causal forecasts of electricity prices in medium and long-term electricity price forecasting. From the evaluation of the electricity price forecasting for Portugal and Spain, in the year of 2017, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) were 9.02% and 12.02%, respectively. In 2018, the MAPE, evaluated for 9 months, for Portugal and Spain equals 7.12% and 6.45%, respectively. © 2018 Revista Facultad de Ingenieria -redin- - Todos los derechos reservados.",Forecasting; MIBEL; Regression analysis,,,,,

"Zhao H., Guo S., Zhao H.",A multi-stage intelligent model for electricity price prediction based on the Beveridge-Nelson disintegration approach,2018,,1.0,"Accurate electricity price prediction is key to the orderly operation of the electricity market. However, the uncertain, stochastic and fluctuant characteristics of electricity pricees make prediction difficult. With the aim of solving this issue, this investigation proposed a multi-stage intelligent model integrating the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition (B-N-D) model, the least square support vector machine (LSSVM), and a nature-inspired optimization model named the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). Firstly, the B-N-D model was utilized to decompose the hourly electricity price time series into determinacy component, periodic trend, and stochastic item. Secondly, the WOA-LSSVM model was proposed to forecast the future hourly data of three components respectively, of which the optimal parameters of LSSVM were determined by using WOA. Finally, the future hourly electricity price data were computed by multiplying the forecasted data of those terms. To verify the validity of the proposed electricity price prediction model in this paper, five comparison approaches based on the B-N-D approach were selected, which are autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), single LSSVM, LSSVM optimized by the fruit-fly optimization algorithm (FOA), LSSVM optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) models, and WOA-LSSVM without B-N-D. By comparatively analyzing the error criteria values of the above models through testing on the objective data of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) electricity market collected from 11 December 2017 to 18 December 2017, from 15 January 2018 to 22 January 2018, and from 1 February 2018 to 25 February 2018, we conclude that the constructed intelligent model in this paper can greatly enhance the prediction precision of electricity prices. © 2018 by the authors.",Beveridge-Nelson decomposition approach; Electricity price prediction; Least square support vector machine; Multi-stage intelligent model; Whale optimization algorithm,accuracy assessment; algorithm; electricity generation; electricity industry; least squares method; numerical model; optimization; prediction; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; United States; Cetacea,,,,

However, the uncertainty of renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind generator (WG), makes it difficult to predict the output power of these resources. Hence, battery energy storage system (BESS) is being introduced. BESS is very effective equipment because it is possible to prevent the power output variation of renewable energy facilities through the charging and discharging of the BESS. Furthermore, demand response (DR) program is attracting attention as an effective instrument for energy management method. It can be divided into two main categories: time-based program and incentive-based program. This paper addresses real-time pricing (RTP) under the time-based program. It enables power supplier to control the load demand based on electricity prices.

"Burnett J.W., Zhao X.",Spatially Explicit Prediction of Wholesale Electricity Prices,2017,,1.0,"Transmission constraints often limit the flow of electricity in a regional transmission network leading to strong interaction effects across different geographically distributed points within the system. In modern wholesale electricity markets, these transmission constraints lead to spatial patterns within the nodal electricity spot prices. This study exploits these spatial patterns to better predict spot prices within a wholesale electricity market. More specifically, we use the latest spatial panel data econometric models to compare within-sample and out-of-sample forecasts against nonspatial panel data models. The spatial panel data approach is explained by demonstrating a simple network optimization model. We find that a dynamic, spatial panel data model provides the best predictions within a forecasting error context. Our results may suggest that the spatial autocorrelation between node prices extends beyond the current market-defined zonal boundaries, which calls into question whether the zonal boundaries accurately reflect the congestion boundaries within the system. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",electricity prices; forecasting; locational marginal pricing; spatial panel data econometrics,autocorrelation; econometrics; electricity supply; error analysis; forecasting method; optimization; panel data; price dynamics; spatial data,,,,
"Grossi L., Nan F.",Robust self exciting Threshold autoregressive models for electricity prices,2014,,1.0,"In this paper we suggest the use of robust GM-SETAR (Self Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive) processes to model and forecast electricity prices observed on deregulated markets. The robustness of the model is achieved by extending to time series the generalized M-type (GM) estimator first introduced for independent multivariate data. As it has been shown in a very recent paper [1], the polynomial weighting function over-performs the classical ordinary least squares method when extreme observations are present. The main advantage of estimating robust SETAR models is the possibility to capture two very well-known stylized facts of electricity prices: nonlinearity produced by changes of regimes and the presence of sudden spikes due to inelasticity of demand. The forecasting performance of the model applied to the Italian electricity market (IPEX) is improved by the introduction of predicted demand as an exogenous regressor. The availability of this regressor is a particular feature of the Italian market. By means of prediction performance indexes and tests, it will be shown that this regressor plays a crucial role and that robust methods improve the overall forecasting performance of the model. © 2014 IEEE.",extreme values; GM estimator; nonlinear models; Terms-Electricity prices,Commerce; Deregulation; Estimation; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Extreme value; Forecasting performance; GM estimator; Non-linear model; Ordinary least squares methods; Prediction performance; Self-Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive models; Terms-Electricity prices; Costs,,,,

For an optimal strategy development, both the internal system costs as well as the future values of the series of electricity prices in external markets need to be known. But in practice, the real problems that must be faced are that both future electricity prices and costs are unknown. Thus, the first ones must be modeled and forecasted and the costs must be calculated. Our methodology for building an optimal strategy consists of three steps: The first step is modeling and forecasting market prices in external systems. The second step is the cost calculation on internal system taking into account the expected prices in the first step. The third step is based on the results of the previous steps, and consists of preparing the bids for external markets.

"Azuma T., Watanabe T.",Stability analysis of load frequency control systems with real-time pricing and external signals,2013,,1.0,"This paper discusses stability of a load frequency control system with real-time pricing. The load frequency control system considered in this paper also depends on an external signal. The external signal corresponds to the predicted electrical load in spot pricing and is called as load-predicted signal. The load frequebcy control system with the external signal can be derived as an uncertain linear system. Since the uncertain linear system is described as an extended uncertain linear system which consists of monomials about the state, stability of the extened system is analized based on sum of squares.

Taking a multi-agent system modeling approach, this paper presents a conceptual platform for discovering dynamic pricing solutions that reflect the varying cost of electricity in the wholesale market as well as the level of demand participation, especially regarding household customers and small and medium sized businesses. At first, an agent-based meta-model representing various concepts, relations, and structure of agents is constructed. Then a domain model can be instantiated based upon the meta-model. Finally, a simulation experiment is developed for use case demonstration and model validation. The simulation is for the supplier to obtain the profit-maximizing demand curve which has such a shape that it follows the spot price curve in inverse ratio. The result suggests that this multi-agent-based construct could contribute to 1) estimating the impacts of various timevarying tariff options on peak-period energy use through simulation, before any experimental pilots can be carried out; 2) modeling the electricity retail market evolving interactions in a systematic manner; 3) inducing innovative simulation configurations.",Agent-based modeling; Computational intelligence; Demand response; Electricity markets; Meta-model; Multi-agent systems; Real-time pricing; Smart grids,Agent-based model; Demand response; Electricity market; Meta model; Real time pricing; Smart grid; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computational methods; Costs; Information systems; Mathematical models; Multi agent systems; Smart power grids; Computer simulation,,,,

"Nerves A.C., Bunyi J.E.A.",A no-arbitrage approach to pricing of Flexible Electricity Contracts considering transmission line rentals,2012,,1.0,"This study considers the impact of transmission line rentals on the pricing of Flexible Electricity Contracts, which allow flexible scheduling of electric energy, using a no-arbitrage approach. A Flexible Electricity Contract requires the buyer or seller to schedule the amount of energy to be supplied for each time interval. Given stochastic models for spot and line rental prices, this approach determines the optimal price of the Flexible Electricity Contract by determining the opportunities that can be advantageous to the buyer or seller, and setting the price of the contract such that there is no arbitrage. The stochastic spot prices are modeled using autoregressive models. On the other hand, stochastic line rental prices are modeled using simple linear regression, with the spot prices as the predictor variable. Based on the said stochastic models for the spot prices and line rental prices, the optimal contract price is determined using Monte Carlo simulation. Simulations are conducted using spot and line rental price information from the Philippine Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. Analysis performed in this study shows that considering transmission line rentals has a significant impact on the pricing of Flexible Electricity Contracts. Furthermore, this study also considers the impact of daily and hourly scheduling provisions on the contract prices. © 2012 IEEE.",arbitrage; contract pricing; electricity market; flexible electricity contracts; Monte-Carlo simulation; transmission line rental,arbitrage; Contract pricing; Electricity contracts; Electricity market; Monte Carlo Simulation; Electric lines; Electricity; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Planning; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Transmission line theory; Costs,,,,

They have to cope with the changed power flow as well as to account for congestions. Therefore they have to take influence on these power flows. One opportunity is represented by variable grid fees which enable a causation-based allocation of grid costs and a higher predictability concerning power system planning. According to the development of pricing in the communication sector flat-rate pricing for grid usage seems to be an appropriate solution. Therefore an approach based on a flatrate tariff with an additional usage-sensitive component is developed. © 2012 IEEE.,distribution grid; flat-rate; Grid fee; grid usage; pricing; renewable energy,Costs; Electric power systems; Distribution grid; flat-rate; Grid fee; grid usage; Renewable energies; Economics,,,,
"Flórez J.Z., Besançon G., Martinez J.J., Davelaar F.",Explicit price method for coordinated control and hydro-power production example,2012,,1.0,"In the context of a general renewed interest in decomposition-coordination control approaches, and in the more particular continuity of former studies of the authors in that respect, the present paper focuses on some so-called price coordination method based on distributed receding horizon controllers, here emphasizing possible explicit schemes both at the controllers level and at the coordinator level. This can clearly be of interest for the control of large scale systems as they arise in power management issues, and is illustrated with an example of hydro-power application. In short, the coordinator computes a price vector and distributes it to the various subsystems composing the overall system to be controlled, on the basis of the predicted control strategies that each of them communicate to it. The main point is that the coordinator here takes advantage of the explicit solutions for local linear Receding Horizon Controls, to globally update those price values in an explicit way as well. This method is illustrated with simulations of an industrial Hydro-Power Valley case-study, using real-data from French main electricity provider EDF (Electricité de France), and a comparison with the more classical coordination scheme based on a gradient algorithm is presented.",Decomposition/coordination; Explicit control; Hydro-power plants; MPC; Price coordination,Controllers; Electric power generation; Electric power system control; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Large scale systems; Control of large-scale systems; Coordination methods; Decomposition-coordination control; Hydro power production; Hydropower plants; Price coordination; Receding horizon control; Receding horizon controllers; Power control,,,,

Nishikawa H.,Time series analysis of JEPX spot price with the box-Jenkins method,2007,,1.0,"Following the examples of other countries, in April 2005 Japan launched wholesale electric power exchange operations as a primary item of system reform in line with electric liberalization. Only two years have passed since the initiation of these operations. However, in the summer of 2005, the surge in market prices was evident, which suggested that certain measures should be taken to confront potential market risks. Establishing a useful system for forecasting market prices through the modeling of price fluctuations in the wholesale electric market became essential. Currently, various price models are being proposed. Taking both the limited amount of data and the model's purpose into consideration, this study adopted the univariate time series model. We conducted a time series analysis on the open price indexes in the JEPX spot market with the Box-Jenkins method. Since a seven-day cycle can be observed in the data, we adopted the seasonal ARIMA model. In accordance with the procedures of the Box-Jenkins method, we determined the degree of the model's polynomial using the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation of the data and estimated the parameters of the model with the maximum likelihood method. We conducted a forecast on next day JEPX spot market prices with this time series model and examined its validity and utility as a forecasting tool. Price forecasts made with this model require only a small amount of data and will save substantial analysis work. Consequently, this method is expected to be widely used by market participants as the reference data for their bid pricing.",Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX); Market risk; Seasonal ARIMA model; Spot market; Time series analysis,Data acquisition; Electric power transmission; Marketing; Parameter estimation; Polynomial approximation; Time series analysis; Box-Jenkins method; Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX); Market risk; Cost accounting,,,,

"Yang H., Lai M.",Chaotic characteristics of electricity price and its forecasting model,2005,,1.0,"In electricity market the price of electricity depends on the joint effect of many factors with its evolving process characterized by very complicated random motion. To reveal the inherent law behind the seemingly random evolving process, first the chaotic feature of electricity price is verified with the chaos theory. The Lyapunov exponents and the fractal dimensions of the attractors are extracted from the phase space reconstructed by the single variable time series of electricity price. Here it can be seen that the electricity price possesses chaotic characteristics, and such a chaotic behavior is further verified by the surrogate data method, providing the basis for performing the short-term forecast of electricity price with the help of the chaos theory. Then a more accurate phase space is reconstructed by the multi-variable time series constituted by the electricity price and its correlated factors, i.e., the system load and the available generating capacity time series. By tracing the evolving trend of the adjacent phase points in the phase space, the global and local electricity price forecasting models based on the recurrent neural network are established, with which the electricity prices in the New England electricity market are successfully predicted. © Institution of Engineers, Australia 2005.",,Chaos theory; Costs; Electric industry; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Multivariable systems; Phase control; Random processes; Time series analysis; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Forecasting models; Random motions; Electricity,,,,

In this paper we argue that most empirical studies using frontier estimation methods such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) over-estimate MACs. The first methodological contribution of this paper is to clarify the conceptual distinction between the shadow price and MAC in order to analyze three sources of upward bias due to the limited set of abatement options, inefficiency, and noisy data. Our second methodological contribution is to develop a novel MAC estimation approach based on convex quantile regression. Compared to the traditional methods, convex quantile regression is more robust to the choice of the direction vector, random noise, and heteroscedasticity.

We find some evidence that new investment arises in areas with recently elevated nodal prices. However, we find no evidence that new generation resources receive a nodal price premium post-entry as projected by the expectation of higher nodal prices. Further, a logit regression analysis suggests that the probability of natural-gas-fired generation investments tends to increase with expected nodal prices in peak hours. However, the estimated relationship is statistically and economically weak and sensitive to model specification.

"Wen S., Zhao T., Tang Y., Xu Y., Fang S., Zhu M., Ding Z.",Joint Energy Management and Voyage Scheduling for All-Electric Ships Using Dynamic Real-Time Electricity Price of Onshore Power,2020,,,"Unlike a land-based standalone microgrid, the shipboard power system of an all-electric ship (AES) needs to shut down generators during berthing at the port for exanimation and maintenance. Therefore, the cost of shore power plays an important role in an economic operation for AESs. In order to fully exploit its potential, a two-stage joint scheduling model is proposed to optimally coordinate the voyage scheduling and power generation of an AES. Different from previous studies which only consider the operation cost of the ship itself, a novel coordinated framework is developed in this paper to address the uncertainty of the real-time electricity price of shore-side electricity to optimize the AES's navigation. A deep learning-based forecasting method is utilized to predict the electricity price of various places for ship operators. Then, a multi-stage hybrid optimization algorithm is designed to solve the proposed multi-objective joint scheduling problem.

The non-storability of electricity and the need for instantaneous balancing of demand and supply can often cause extreme short-lived fluctuations in electricity prices. These fluctuations are termed price spikes.

As price spikes, we define the prices that lie above the 95th quantile estimated by fitting a Generalized Pareto distribution in the innovation distribution of an AR-EGARCH model.

"Agurto R., Fuentes F., García C.J., Skoknic E.",The macroeconomic impact of the electricity price: lessons from Chile,2020,,,"This article presents the hypothesis that exogenous shocks in the electricity market, through variations in prices that are independent of changes in oil prices, may affect the business cycle of the Chilean economy in the short and medium term. The results of our research confirm this hypothesis: shocks of different signs that modify investment in power generation—delays or new investment in renewable energies—have played an important role in the fluctuation of the business cycle. For example, the comparison of different scenarios reveals that after a few years, delays could have caused losses of around 6.0% of GDP growth, because the price of electricity would have been far from its equilibrium value for a long time. Therefore, without the strong investment in renewables, among other technologies, the delays would have materialized, resulting in relevant costs to the economy. These results have important policy implications. Chile has been a leader in Latin America in terms of electricity market reform since 1982. Therefore, it is essential to study possible changes in the Chilean electricity market, to the extent that it could lead other countries to question the benefits of implementing similar market reforms, especially if negative shocks in the electricity generation sector are not compensated by new investments. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bayesian estimation; Business cycle; Electric energy; Macroeconomics models,,,,,

The proposed model comprises a linear autoregressive (AR) part and nonlinear moving average (MA) part obtained through the use of Legendre polynomial basis functions. The Legendre polynomial functional block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher dimensional space through basis functions without using any hidden layer like the multilayered perceptron (MLP) network. Instead of using the standard forward-backward (FB-LMS) algorithm for learning the weight parameters of the ARMALEG (hybrid ARMA and Legendre network) a robust H-infinity filter is used which is superior to the widely used extended Kalman filter in terms of handling uncertain noise covariances resulting in fast convergence and tracking. Further to improve the accuracy, the H-infinity filter parameters are optimised using a differential evolution (DE) strategy.

This paper describes a novel model for price forecasting is proposed by the developed least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), which integrates Clustering algorithm with LS-SVM. First, clustering of the data samples are performed, which aims at mining the latent patterns in the data. After that, LS-SVM is applied for the nonlinear regression modeling of electricity price and its influence factors signed with its class, which results in a more efficient training and forecasting. Finally, hourly prices and loads of different market are employed to test the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.",Demand-side management; Electricity market; Least squares support vector machine; Nonlinear regression,Demand side managements; Electricity consumers; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Financial incentives; Least squares support vector machines; Non-linear regression; Nonlinear regression models; Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Electric utilities; Signal processing; Support vector machines,,,,
"Zhou Z., Botterud A.",Price responsive demand for operating reserves and energy in electricity markets with wind power,2013,,,"Similar to demand response for energy, operating reserve can be elastic to prices given that minimal reliability criteria are satisfied. We present a probabilistic-based framework to estimate a demand curve for operating reserves. The operating reserve is estimated accounting for uncertainties from load, thermal unit contingencies, and wind power. The resulting demand for reserves is dynamically scheduled and co-optimized with energy in the market clearing. In a case study, the framework is applied to a two-settlement electricity market with centralized unit commitment, also considering demand response for energy. We find that the proposed demand curve for operating reserves contributes to improved handling of system uncertainties and more efficient pricing of operating reserves. Price elastic demand for energy has a similar effect on dispatch flexibility and cost, but has a less significant impact on the prices for spinning reserves. © 2013 IEEE.",Demand response; electricity markets; forecast uncertainty; operating reserves; wind power,Demand response; Electricity market; Forecast uncertainty; Operating reserve; Price responsive demand; Reliability criterion; Spinning reserves; System uncertainties; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Costs,,,,
"Illing B., Bretschneider P., Westermann D.",Flat-rate pricing for grid usage in distribution grids,2013,,,The increasing change of the electrical power system caused by the influence of renewable energy on the power flow in the distribution grid effects mainly the distribution system operators. They have to deal with changed power flow as well as to account for congestions. Therefore they have to take influence on these power flows. One opportunity is represented by variable grid fees which enable a causation-based allocation of grid costs and a higher predictability concerning power system planning. According to the development of pricing in the communication sector flat-rate pricing for grid usage seems to be an appropriate solution. Therefore an approach based on a flat-rate tariff with an additional usage-sensitive component is proposed. © 2013 IEEE.,distribution grid; flat-rate; Grid fee; grid usage; pricing; renewable energy,Distribution grid; flat-rate; Grid fee; grid usage; Renewable energies; Commerce; Electric power systems; Costs,,,,
"Bosco B., Parisio L., Pelagatti M.",Optimal pricing behavior of vertically integrated utilities: Theory and evidence from the Italian electricity wholesale market,2013,,,"In this paper we present a model of supply prices coordination in electricity markets in which a group of firms is vertically integrated. We show that vertical integration, i.e. the presence of a supplier and a buyer belonging to the same coordinated group, represents an obstacle to the full exploitation of market power on the part of generators. This empirical evidence is still in search of a theoretical explanation and this paper contributes to the existing literature by offering both a theoretical discussion and an empirical investigation. The latter is conducted using Italian electricity auction data and shows that bid prices of generators are significantly affected (i.e. moderated) by variables incorporating vertical integration into the econometric model. This is what we call the counterspeculation effect of vertical integration. Italian empirical estimations confirm the presence of this effect and give information about its magnitude and significance. © 2013 IEEE.",electricity markets; Regulation; strategic delegation; vertical integration,Electricity auctions; Electricity market; Empirical estimations; Empirical investigation; Integrated utilities; Regulation; strategic delegation; Vertical integration; Costs; Integration; Commerce,,,,
"Hajiabadi M.E., Rajabi Mashhadi H.",Modeling of the maximum entropy problem as an optimal control problem and its application to pdf estimation of electricity price,2013,,,"This paper proposes a novel two step modeling and analysis on the continuous random variable of electricity price. At the first step, the continuous optimal control theory is used to model and solve the maximum entropy problem for a continuous random variable. The maximum entropy principle provides a method to obtain least-biased Probability Density Function (pdf) estimation. In this paper, to find a closed form solution for the maximum entropy problem with any number of moment constraints, the entropy is considered as a functional measure and the moment constraints are considered as the state equations. Therefore, the pdf estimation problem can be reformulated as the optimal control problem. At the second step, the proposed unbiased pdf estimator is used to estimate the pdf of electricity price. Moreover, the statistical indices and the distributional characteristics of electricity price are analyzed at each load level. The simulation results on the electricity price data of New England, Ontario and Nord Pool electricity markets show the efficiency of the proposed pdf estimator. In addition, the obtained results show that by decreasing the load, the statistical and distributional characteristics of the electricity price inclined toward the statistical properties of the normal distribution.",Electricity price; Maximum entropy (ME); Optimal control; Probability density function (pdf),,,,,

"Le Coq C., Orzen H.",Price caps and fluctuating demands in electricity markets: Experimental evidence of competitive bidding,2012,,,"This paper reports results from a laboratory experiment designed to test how competitive behavior is sensitive to price cap and demand level in a uniform price auction. Several features of the electricity markets inspire the experimental design. Two treatments with different price caps are considered and demand is high in certain periods, and low in others. In addition the market is characterized by excess capacity regardless of the demand level and competitive outcome is predicted. Although attempts to collude do take place, these fail to increase market prices in any substantial way. Despite this, inefficiencies do occur as the attempts at colluding imply that marginal costs fail to equalize across firms. This allocative inefficiencies appear to be more severe, both when the demand is high and when the price cap is high. © 2012 IEEE.",Industrial economics Oligopoly Power generation economics Electricity supply industry deregulation; Microeconomics,Competitive behavior; Competitive bidding; Electricity market; Excess capacity; Experimental evidence; Laboratory experiments; Marginal costs; Market price; Microeconomics; Power generation economics; Price caps; Uniform price auction; Commerce; Competition; Economics; Electric power generation; Costs,,,,

The models range from quantitative models, cost-based models, economic equilibrium models, agent-based models, experimental models, and fundamental models determining the stochastic properties of electricity prices. The focus of the investigation was to calibrate a fundamental model using actual data on electricity price and load from the European Energy Exchange EEX. Stationarity of historical data was ascertained using the Dickey-Fuller test. The calibration entailed the use of principal component analysis and a linear regression model in conjunction with Kalman filter and maximum likelihood method.

Helmke A.C.,"Wind energy auction in Brazil prices, barriers, opportunities",2010,,,"Since a severe energy crisis in 2001, Brazil has been exploring the vast potential - estimated at between 60 and 143 GW - of its wind resources. The federal government's promotion scheme Proinfa - based on a feed-in tariff - saw the installation of 1.422 MW. But Proinfa did not meet all stakeholder expectations. Projects were selected based on the issuing date of the environmental license, and wind turbines were not readily available. As a result Proinfa's tenure was extended twice. However, never before had a programme of its scale been attempted in Latin America. Presently, wind energy production is being encouraged through reverse auctions. This mirrors the Brazilian electricity market, which is also auction based. These auctions award PPAs to the lowest bidder. The first auction for wind energy took place at the end of December 2009. Some 1.800 MW of wind energy were contracted at an average price of approximately 60 Euros/MWh. The first auction drew significant interest from the sector which submitted backlogged projects. Barriers to market development like state-level taxation and grid-connection issues are offset by accessible public loans, several turbine manufacturers operating in Brazil, wind-hydro complementarity, increased political awareness, and the involvement of local utilities in the sector. As the sector has matured, the time to deliver operating projects has arrived. Long term promotion goals should also be formulated. If following these steps Brazil is in an excellent position to be the regional leader in wind energy.",,Brazilian electricity markets; Energy crisis; Federal governments; Feed-in tariff; Grid connections; Latin America; Market development; Operating project; Reverse auction; Time-to-deliver; Wind energy production; Wind resources; Energy policy; Exhibitions; Taxation; Wind power,,,,

As our estimations for Germany's power sector show, these price increases result in substantial windfall profits, giving rise to public skepticism and calls for an auctioning of certificates in the future. While empirical evidence on the ETS' impacts is scant, the findings reviewed here indicate that even in the absence of certificate auctioning, energy-intensive industry sectors may suffer heavily from the ETS-induced electricity price increases.

"Covas R., Pascual L.",Pricing daily electricity transfer capacities in the Spain - France interconnection,2008,,,"Nowadays, it is possible to sell energy across countries using the existing interconnections. In Europe, one example is the interconnection between France and Spain. These interconnections have limited capacity. Therefore, the right to use the interconnections becomes a valuable position for the different companies and players, due to the spread of electricity prices between countries. The transfer capacities are obtained in annual, monthly, daily and intra-day transfer auctions. This fact is well known by market players, who daily attend capacity auctions, on which they bid in order to gain access to the network. Actually, around 26 companies are entitled to attend these auctions. As a first approach, in order to set your bids for the daily auctions, the access to the network is valued through the Black & Scholes Formulas for the European Call Spread Option. This approach is based on forecasts for the hourly prices in both countries, and on the hourly correlation between them. Since selling energy across countries implies, additionally, offer and demand bids for electricity in each country, thus having positive probabilities of negative cashflows, the option to use transfer capacities cannot be priced with the Black-Scholes Formulas. In this work we propose a new way of pricing the daily electricity transfer capacity, where we take into account the trader's daily operation and, therefore, all the inherent risks factors not included in the Black & Scholes world. We support our proposal by comparing our results with real auction values, and the ones obtained with the Black & Scholes approach. ©2008 IEEE.",Conditional expectation; Day and intra-day electricity market; Multivariate normal distribution; Spread option; Transfer capacities auction,Arsenic compounds; Commerce; Computer networks; Costs; Industrial economics; Ketones; Occupational risks; Conditional expectation; Day and intra-day electricity market; Multivariate normal distribution; Spread option; Transfer capacities auction; Electric load forecasting,,,,

"Reinisch W., Tezuka T.",Simulating the Influence of Wind Power Generation on the Electricity Market Price,2005,,,"Wind power has recently become quite popular among power generation companies all over the world. In the year 2003 alone 8,133 MW of new installations have been built up. When integrating these huge amount of wind power into an existing power grid and the trading process of a power utility on the electricity market, the uncertainty in wind power generation becomes a critical point. There are basically two viewpoints on this issue. First, operating wind power generation in a power grid needs a high amount of regulation reserve. Therefore wind generation is expensive. On the other hand, wind power generation does not consume fuel and therefore there are no fuel cost. To estimate the consequences of high wind power generation we propose in this paper a simulation model that is capable of simulating spot and ancillary markets, as well as the physical aspects of electricity generation. By simulating the interaction between spot and ancillary market we calculate the development of the electricity prices on the spot market and the ancillary market with growing wind power generation. © 2005, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

The general result from the traditional theory charges the off-peak consumers marginal operating costs only and the peak users marginal operating plus marginal capacity cost. Theoretical attempts at modification have proved that the traditional conclusion holds only for homogeneous plant capacity (e.g., in one plant case), and in economic loading of two or more plants, the off-peak price also includes a part of capacity costs. This paper, however, shows that if the off-peak period output is explicitly expressed in terms of capacity utilisation of that period, the result will be an off-peak price including a fraction of the capacity cost in proportion to its significance relative to total utilisation. This would appear as a general case, irrespective of the nature of generation technology, that is, ever when there is only one plant.

"Muchayi Maxwell, El-Hawary M.E.",Method for optimal pricing of electric supply including transmission system considerations,1997,,,"Determining real-time electricity rate structures is currently receiving a great deal attention. In this paper, a strategy for pricing electricity supply is formulated and evaluated. Unlike other methods which use only the variation of fuel cost for generation to estimate the rate structures, the proposed pricing algorithm incorporates the optimal allocation of transmission system operating costs based on time-of-use pricing. The transmission costs are obtained by assigning a price k to each unit of power flow in the network. The assignment does not discriminate between participants located at differing parts of the network. The real-time pricing reflects the instantaneous cost of production and functions as a load management tool because this interacts with consumer behavior. The demand for power flows and transmission on an electricity supply system, like the demand for any bundle of economic goods, depends upon the assigned transmission prices, together with the economic benefit to the consumer. It is assumed that there are no privately owned generating plants and that all plants and transmission lines are operated by the utility. The modeling scheme is applied to the IEEE standard 5, 14, 30 and 57 bus power systems and involves solving a modified optimal power flow problem (OPF) iteratively using the MINOS package. It is concluded that the method has a wide potential application in electricity supply pricing.",,Algorithms; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Electric rates; Industrial economics; Iterative methods; Optimization; Resource allocation; Standards; Transmission network calculations; Electricity supply pricing; Software package MINOS; Electric utilities,,,,

Schramm G.,Relative price changes and the benefits and costs of alternative power projects,1969,,,"What are the conclusions that we have to draw from the foregoing discussion? We must conclude that the prevailing practice of evaluating benefits and costs in terms of present costs and prices is not only likely to lead to an under-statement of actual costs, but also may lead to gross inefficiencies in project selection. This danger is particularly great in cases of hydro projects with long construction time horizons or long-term project sequences that depend for their feasibility on some common facility. While the need to estimate future price relationships may seem to introduce new uncertainties into project evaluations the use of prevailing prices is even less satisfactory. A somewhat inaccurate estimate of future changes, as long as it points in the right direction and as long as it is backed up by a sensitivity analysis that tests the effects of the assumptions on overall benefits and costs will provide a better and more realistic picture. Today this issue is of particular urgency since the traditional cost advantage of hydro over thermal alternatives is quickly disappearing. Given the very dramatic cost reductions expected from the introduction of second and third generation atomic power plants it becomes mandatory for any power system planner to take these expected changes explicitly into account. © 1969 Annals of Regional Science.",,,,,,
