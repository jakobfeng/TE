"Heydari A., Majidi Nezhad M., Pirshayan E., Astiaso Garcia D., Keynia F., De Santoli L.",Short-term electricity price and load forecasting in isolated power grids based on composite neural network and gravitational search optimization algorithm,2020,2,"Electricity price forecasting is a key aspect for market participants to maximize their economic efficiency in deregulated markets. Nevertheless, due to its non-linearity and non-stationarity, the trend of the price is usually complicated to predict. On the other hand, the accuracy of short-term electricity price and load forecasting is fundamental for an efficient management of electric systems. An accurate prediction can benefit future plans and economic operations of the power systems’ operators. In this paper, a new and accurate combined model has been proposed for short-term load forecasting and short-term price forecasting in deregulated power markets. It includes variational mode decomposition, mix data modeling, feature selection, generalized regression neural network and gravitational search algorithm. A mixed data model for the price and load forecast has been considered and integrated with the original signal series of price and load and their decomposition. Throughout this model, the candidate input variables are chosen by a distinct hybrid feature selection. Two reliable electricity markets (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland and Spanish electricity markets) have been used to test the proposed forecasting model and the obtained results have been compared with different valid benchmark prediction models. Lastly, the real load data of Favignana Island's power grid have been considered to test the proposed model. The obtained results pinpointed that the proposed model's precision and stability is higher than in other benchmark forecasting models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price forecasting; Feature selection; Generalized Regression Neural Network; Load forecasting; Optimization algorithm; Power grid management,Deregulation; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Predictive analytics; Deregulated power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Generalized regression neural networks; Gravitational search algorithms; Hybrid feature selections; Short term load forecasting; Short-term price forecasting; Spanish electricity markets; Electric load forecasting; algorithm; artificial neural network; benchmarking; electricity generation; electricity supply; forecasting method; market conditions; nonlinearity; optimization; power plant; precision; prediction; Aegadian Islands; Favignana; Italy; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; Sicily; Trapani; United States,5,2,2,1,Article,1,c
"Halužan M., Verbič M., Zorić J.",Performance of alternative electricity price forecasting methods: Findings from the Greek and Hungarian power exchanges,2020,1,"This paper evaluates the performance of alternative algorithms for day-ahead electricity price forecasting. Forecasting performance is assessed based on evidence from the Greek and Hungarian Power Market simulation. The electricity price formation process is simulated on a long time series spanning from January 2015 to September 2018. The EPF models are structured upon the explanatory variables that are available to the market participants before the exchange gate closure, through the publicly available ENTSO-E transparency platform. Relationships between the electricity spot price and explanatory variables are estimated by the selected econometric, data mining, and machine learning algorithms. The econometric autoregressive model with exogeneous explanatory variables is a benchmark model, as the other alternative approaches are used to overcome the linearity bias in the ordinary least squares estimator. We analyse the impact of a different training sample size as well as the impact of training on an hourly clustered sample on the forecasting performance. The support vector machine algorithm turned out to be the best alternative approach, with the lowest mean absolute error and statistically confirmed better forecasts compared to the benchmark econometric autoregressive model. The majority of the tested algorithms perform better with smaller training samples, whereas neural network based approaches prefer large training samples. Models with hourly clustered training samples have higher accuracy based on the Hungarian evidence, while hourly non-clustered training is a superior training method based on the Greek findings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial neural networks; Data mining; Electricity price forecasting; ENTSOE-E transparency platform; Greek power exchange; Hungarian power exchange; Learning sample size; Machine learning; Rolling-window,Data mining; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Power quality; Sampling; Support vector machines; Alternative algorithms; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Forecasting performance; Network-based approach; Ordinary least squares estimators; Power market simulation; Support vector machine algorithm; Power markets; accuracy assessment; algorithm; alternative energy; artificial neural network; econometrics; error analysis; machine learning; numerical model; performance assessment; support vector machine; time series; vector autoregression; Alfold; Hungary,5,1,2,1,Article,"1, 4",a

This paper proposes a self-adaptive, decomposed, heterogeneous, and ensemble learning model for short-term electricity price forecasting one, two, and three-months-ahead in the Brazilian market. Exogenous variables, such as supply, lagged prices and demand are considered as inputs signals of the forecasting model. Firstly, the coyote optimization algorithm is adopted to tune the hyperparameters of complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition in the pre-processing phase. Next, three machine learning models, including extreme learning machine, gradient boosting machine, and support vector regression models, as well as Gaussian process, are designed with the intent of handling the components obtained through the signal decomposition approach with focus on time series forecasting. The individual forecasting models are directly integrated in order to obtain the final forecasting prices one to three-months-ahead. In this case, a grid of forecasting models is obtained. The best forecasting model is the one that has better generalization out-of-sample. The empirical results show the efficiency of the proposed model. Additionally, it can achieve forecasting errors lower than 4.2% in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error. The ranking of importance of the variables, from the smallest to the largest is, lagged prices, demand, and supply. This paper provided useful insights for multi-step-ahead forecasting in the electrical market, once the proposed model can enhance forecasting accuracy and stability. © 2020 by the authors.

"Zhang Y., Deng C., Zhao R., leto S.",A novel integrated price and load forecasting method in smart grid environment based on multi-level structure,2020,,"Prediction of load and price are two critical key in power system planning and operation. Most of the recent works in this area forecast the load and price signals separately but, a dynamic model in smart grid is evaluated while, the customers may have opportunity to react the proposed prices changing through shifting the electricity usages from expensive to cheaper hours. So, the load and price signals are coupled strongly which made the previous prediction models ineffective. In this research, a synthetic prediction approach has been proposed by considering the load and price signals, simultaneously. This method works as multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model based on least square support vector machine (LSSVM) forecast engine. Furthermore, a dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) is suggested in this approach to decompose the original signal into different small sub-signals. Beside of that, the modified mutual information (MMI) filter has been used to choose the best candidate input of forecast engine. The learning section is also coupled with novel modified optimization algorithm based on gravitational search algorithm (GSA) which called as modified GSA (MGSA). Finally, various forecasting errors have been considered as average mean absolute percentage error and error variance to get the comparison outcomes and performance of forecasting approaches. For this purpose, different markets have been considered as test case to show the efficiency of suggested approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",DWT; Feature selection; Load and price prediction; LSSVM; MIMO model; Smart grids,Electric power system planning; Electric power transmission networks; Engines; Errors; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; MIMO systems; Predictive analytics; Signal processing; Smart power grids; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Dyadic wavelet transform; Gravitational search algorithm (GSA); Least square support vector machines; Mean absolute percentage error; Multi-input-multi-output models; Optimization algorithms; Power system planning and operation; Price and load forecasting; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1,Article,4,
"Motamedi Sedeh O., Ostadi B.",Optimization of bidding strategy in the day-ahead market by consideration of seasonality trend of the market spot price,2020,,"Due to the liberalization of the electricity market, evaluation of competitor behaviors, as an uncertainty factor, is a critical information for a Generation Company (GenCo) to maximize its profit by optimizing bidding strategies. In this paper, a new bidding strategy model has been presented based on the Genetic Algorithm and a refined Monte Carlo simulation model. This process is done through the similarity function and consideration of the seasonality trend as the main characteristic of the electricity spot price. The main contributions of this paper include: (a): Consideration of the similarity value for all days in historical dates in the database, (b): Consideration of the seasonality trend of market clearing price by applying K-Means algorithm for clustering historical data based on demand, (c): Application of the proposed model for each cluster's data, (d): Performance evaluation of the fitness function of each generated strategy by a simulation model based on historical data. The proposed model has been tested for the 10 subsets of Iran's electricity market 2016.

"Fu T., Zhang S., Wang C.",Application and research for electricity price forecasting system based on multi-objective optimization and sub-models selection strategy,2020,,"In general, electricity prices reflect the cost to build, finance, maintain, and operate power plants and the electricity grid. Therefore, the cost-optimized scheduling of industrial loads with accurate price forecasts is very important. As such, recent studies have attempted to combine models to forecast electricity prices more accurately. Earlier combined models have tended to ignore the selection of sub-models and data analyses, leading to poor forecasting performance. In order to select the best forecasting models in a combined model, we propose a hybrid electricity price forecasting system that includes a data analysis module, a sub-model selection strategy module, optimized forecasting processing, and a model evaluation module. As such, the hybrid system fully exploits the advantages of a single model, thus improving the forecasting performance of the combined model. The experimental results show that the proposed system selects optimal sub-models effectively and successfully identifies future trend changes in the electricity price. Thus, the system can be an effective tool in the planning and implementation of smart grids. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Combined model; Electricity prices; Hybrid forecasting system; Sub-models selection strategy,Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Multiobjective optimization; Power plants; Electricity grids; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting models; Forecasting performance; Industrial loads; Model evaluation; Price forecasts; Power markets,5,1,1,1,Article,6,"a, c"
Marcjasz G.,Forecasting electricity prices using deep neural networks: A robust hyper-parameter selection scheme,2020,1,"Deep neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity. However, their application requires setting multiple hyper-parameters, and the performance relies strongly on this choice. We address this issue and propose a robust ex-ante hyper-parameter selection procedure for the day-ahead electricity price forecasting that, when used jointly with a tested forecast averaging scheme, yields high performance throughout three-year long out-of-sample test periods in two distinct markets. Being based on a grid search with models evaluated on long samples, the methodology mitigates the noise induced by local optimization. Forecast averaging across calibration window lengths and hyper-parameter sets allows the proposed methodology to outperform a parameter-rich least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-estimated model and a deep neural network (DNN) with non-optimized hyper-parameters in terms of the mean absolute forecast error. © 2020 by the author.

"MacIejowska K., Uniejewski B., Serafin T.",PCA forecast averaging - Predicting day-ahead and intraday electricity prices,2020,,"Recently, the development in combining point forecasts of electricity prices obtained with different length of calibration windows have provided an extremely efficient and simple tool for improving predictive accuracy. However, the proposed methods are strongly dependent on expert knowledge and may not be directly transferred from one to another model or market. Hence, we consider a novel extension and propose to use principal component analysis (PCA) to automate the procedure of averaging over a rich pool of predictions. We apply PCA to a panel of over 650 point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows length. The robustness of the approach is evaluated with three different forecasting tasks, i.e., forecasting day-ahead prices, forecasting intraday ID3 prices one day in advance, and finally very short term forecasting of ID3 prices (i.e., six hours before delivery). The empirical results are compared using the Mean Absolute Error measure and Giacomini and White test for conditional predictive ability (CPA). The results indicate that PCA averaging not only yields significantly more accurate forecasts than individual predictions but also outperforms other forecast averaging schemes. © 2020 by the authors.",Day-ahead market; Decision-making; Electricity price forecasting; EPF; Forecast averaging; Intraday market; Principal component analysis,Calibration; Costs; Day-ahead prices; Electricity prices; Expert knowledge; Individual prediction; Mean absolute error; Predictive abilities; Predictive accuracy; Very short term forecasting; Forecasting,5,1,"1, 3",1,Article,7,
"Gulay E., Duru O.",Hybrid modeling in the predictive analytics of energy systems and prices,2020,,"The aim of this paper is to illustrate the nature of the residuals of a forecasting process and to propose a hybrid approach with linear and nonlinear components predicted by corresponding methodologies. It is a common practice that residuals are assumed to be unpredictable or are reiterated into a model as lagged variables to capture any information remaining in the residual data. The central argument of this paper is that residuals from energy price forecasting can still carry predictive information in its complex and nonlinear form. Although the linear modeling is initially very accurate, reiterating residuals in linear structures is a mismatch of data type and methodology. In this regard, the proposed algorithm hybridizes or combines linear components captured by the Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) and nonlinear components processed by the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve post-sample accuracy. The conventional reiterative process can improve in-sample accuracy, which literally has no value for business forecasting practices. Through a fair benchmark comparison, including methodologies of other combinations, the proposed algorithm is cross-validated by predictive accuracy gain in the out-of-sample (holdout) dataset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Combination forecasting; Energy markets; Energy prices; Price discovery; Price forecasting; Residual modeling,Costs; Forecasting; Neural networks; Signal processing; Autoregressive distributed lag models; Benchmark comparison; Business forecasting; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Linear components; Nonlinear components; Predictive accuracy; Predictive information; Predictive analytics; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial neural network; data set; energy market; forecasting method,"4, 5",2,1,1,Article,1,"a, b, c"

Considering all the potent factors in determining the electricity prices - some of which have stochastic nature - makes this a cumbersome task. In this article, first, Grey correlation analysis is applied to select the effective parameters in EPF problem and eliminate redundant factors based on low correlation grades. Then, a deep neural network with stacked denoising auto-encoders has been utilized to denoise data sets from different sources individually. After that, to detect the main features of the input data and putting aside the unnecessary features, dimension reduction process is implemented. Finally, the rough structure artificial neural network (ANN) has been executed to forecast the day-ahead electricity price.

"Wang J., Yang W., Du P., Niu T.",Outlier-robust hybrid electricity price forecasting model for electricity market management,2020,5,"Electricity market management is of great importance for cleaner production in the development of society. However, despite this significance, electricity price forecasting remains a challenging task. Hybrid models are widely employed for forecasting electricity price, which has the characteristics of being non-stationarity, random, and non-linear. Despite their success, current hybrid models require improvement. In particular, data preprocessing, artificial intelligence optimization, feature selection, and basic forecasting engine selection should be considered. In this study, in addition to these issues, we consider the negative influence of outliers on the modeling of electricity price. In particular, a novel outlier-robust hybrid model is developed for forecasting electricity price, which combines a basic forecasting engine called outlier-robust extreme learning machine model and three new algorithms. Specifically, a new optimizer called chaotic sine cosine algorithm is developed to obtain the ideal parameters for phase space reconstruction, and then a novel feature selection method is developed to construct the optimal features in the modeling of electricity price. Moreover, an effective data preprocessing method is proposed for effective forecasting by capturing electricity price features. Subsequently, experiments based on electricity price data from the electricity markets of Australia and Singapore demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to other benchmark models.

In this context, some current forecasting systems use data preprocessing and optimization for theoretical and practical achievements. However, some limitations to these systems exist which need to be urgently solved. First, future information is overdrawn in the data preprocessing stage of these forecasting systems, which is actually unknown in practical applications. The crucial question, therefore, is how to develop a forecasting system without using any future information. Second, the complex features of original nonlinear and nonstationary electricity price have a negative influence on the generalization ability of these previously developed models. To decrease the negative effects on management, a method to develop a forecasting system to improve the model's generalization ability is required. Therefore, in this study, we developed an adaptive deterministic and probabilistic interval forecasting system for multi-step electricity price forecasting, which can present more valuable information to power market decision makers. Two cases and one comparative study are provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the developed system in multi-step electricity price forecasting.

"Bisoi R., Dash P.K., Das P.P.",Short-term electricity price forecasting and classification in smart grids using optimized multikernel extreme learning machine,2020,4,"Short-term electricity price forecasting in deregulated electricity markets has been studied extensively in recent years but without significant reduction in price forecasting errors. Also demand-side management and short-term scheduling operations in smart grids do not require strictly very accurate forecast and can be executed with certain practical price thresholds. This paper, therefore, presents a multikernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) for both short-term electricity price forecasting and classification according to some prespecified price thresholds. The kernel ELM does not require the hidden layer mapping function to be known and produces robust prediction and classification in comparison with the conventional ELM using random weights between the input and hidden layers. Further in the MKELM formulation, the linear combination of the weighted kernels is optimized using vaporization precipitation-based water cycle algorithm (WCA) to produce significantly accurate electricity price prediction and classification. The combination of MKELM and WCA is named as WCA-MKELM in this work. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, three electricity markets, namely PJM, Ontario and New South Wales, are considered for electricity price forecasting and classification producing fairly accurate results. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Electricity price forecasting and classification; Extreme learning machine; Kernel extreme learning machine; Kernel functions; Mutated water cycle algorithm; Price thresholds,Commerce; Deregulation; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme learning machine; Kernel function; Price thresholds; Water cycle; Power markets,5,2,1,1,Article,1,b

"Huang C.-J., Shen Y., Chen Y.-H., Chen H.-C.",A novel hybrid deep neural network model for short-term electricity price forecasting,2020,,"A Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things is fundamentally an Internet of Things, but focused upon power systems. Being able to predict these prices accurately may help with the identification of customer needs and the effective regulation of the power grid by power producers. It may also help electric power traders to manage risks, make correct decisions, and obtain more benefits. In this paper, a novel hybrid model is proposed for short-term electricity price prediction. The model consists of three algorithms: Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD); a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). This is called SEPNet for convenience. The annual electricity price data is divided into seasons because of seasonal differences in the time series of electricity prices. The VMD algorithm is used to decompose the complex time series of electricity prices into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different center frequencies. The CNN is used to further extract the time-domain features for all the intrinsic model functions in the VMD domain. The GRU is then employed to process and learn the time-domain features extracted by the CNN, leading to the final prediction. A comparison is made with five models, such as LSTM, CNN, VMD-CNN, BP, VMD-ELMAN. The results showed that the proposed model had the best performance, and it was found that using VMD can improve the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the four seasons by 84% and 81%, respectively. The addition of GRU in the SEPNet model further improved the MAPE and RMSE by 19% and 25%, respectively. Including CNN and VMD-CNN, that shows that the proposed model has the best performance. The MAPE and RMSE for the four seasonal averages are 0.730% and 0.453, respectively. This confirms that the SEPNet model has the feasibility and high accuracy to predict short-term electricity prices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",convolutional neural network; electricity price forecasting; gated recurrent unit; intrinsic mode function; variational mode decomposition,Backpropagation; Convolutional neural networks; Costs; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Internet of things; Mean square error; Power markets; Predictive analytics; Time series; Complex time series; Electricity price forecasting; Intrinsic Mode functions; Mean absolute percentage error; Neural network model; Root mean square errors; Seasonal differences; Time domain features; Long short-term memory,5,1,1,1,Article,1,d
"Gundu V., Simon S.P.",PSO–LSTM for short term forecast of heterogeneous time series electricity price signals,2020,,"Electricity price forecasting plays an important role in the power system network, in order to promote the decision-making process for power generation and consumption. Long term forecasting is not viable as there is an uncertainty in the forecast due to increasing the integration of renewable sources with the existing grids. Since the behavior of the electricity price time sequence signal is highly non-linear and seasonal, deep neural network is the best model for learning the non-linear behavior within the data and for the purpose of forecasting. Hence this paper proposes an enhanced particle swarm optimization based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model, which is used to forecast the closing price of the Indian Energy Exchange. Particle swarm optimization technique is used to optimize the LSTM network input weights, which in turn minimize the forecast error with reduced architecture.

However, it is very difficult to estimate the electricity energy production in advance and store the rest of the electric energy due to the climate, environment, population and other factors. Based on data preprocessing and artificial intelligence optimization algorithm, this paper introduces a combined forecasting method. The proposed method contains six individual methods, and each individual method has its own usage. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is adopted to reduce noise from the original data; three individual forecasting methods, Jordan neural network, the echo state network, least squares support vector machine, are applied to obtain the intermediate forecasting results; two optimization algorithms, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing, are used to optimize the parameters of the combined model. This paper not only validates the superiority of the combined model compared to the single predictive model through the simulation experiments of power load data and electricity price data. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of the combined power load and electricity price forecast results are 1.14% and 7.58%, respectively, which are higher than the MAPE error of the corresponding single models prediction results. It has also been verified that the process of eliminating noise by the SSA plays a positive role in the accuracy of the combined forecasting model. In addition, two series of experiments on the power load data lead to two very interesting conclusions. One of the conclusions is that as the size of the test data increases, the prediction accuracy of the model decreases; the other is that the predicted result calculated through the optimized combined weight is better than the combined result calculated using the average weight, and the average weight is used. Weighted combination does not improve the prediction accuracy of a single model. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",ESN network; Jordan neural network; LSSVM; Power load and price forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis,Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Particle size analysis; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Simulated annealing; Spectrum analysis; Support vector machines; Combined forecasting; Echo state networks; Jordan neural networks; Least squares support vector machines; Optimization algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Short term electric load; Singular spectrum analysis; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1,Article,5,

First, EWT is used as a processing tool to decompose the original signal into specific modal components according to the characteristics of the signal itself. Then, considering the complexity of forecasting nonlinear subseries, SVR and BiLSTM are used as basic framework to forecast the nonlinear subseries. At the same time, BO is introduced to adjust parameters and optimize model performance. In last, the final prediction results are combined by the prediction results of different models. The proposed hybrid model is employed on the data gathered from the European Power Exchange Spot (EPEXSPOT). Five different case studies are adopted to verify the effectiveness of BO, EWT and hybrid model respectively. Statistical tests of experimental results compared with other situations demonstrated the proposed hybrid model can achieve a better forecasting performance. © 2019",Bayesian optimization; Bi-directional long short-term memory; Electricity price forecasting; Empirical wavelet transform; Time series analysis,Brain; Commerce; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Signal processing; Time series analysis; Wavelet transforms; Bayesian optimization; Bi-directional; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting performance; Market participants; Model performance; Processing tools; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets,5,1,1,1,Article,4,

Starting from available state of the art, we propose a forecast technique exploiting a nonlinear auto regressive model with exogenous input, including a feature selection mechanism based on the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The rationale behind such a choice is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to target potential increase of forecast accuracy by learning complex non-linear mappings. On the other hand, we want to increase the interpretability of the resulting model and minimize the effort needed to properly set up the forecaster. A framework such as the LASSO, capable to self-extract features from spot price multi-variate time series, might represent a very useful tool for industrial practitioners.

"Xu J., Baldick R.",Day-ahead price forecasting in ERCOT market using neural network approaches,2019,1,"Electricity is the ""blood"" of society. Electricity is a special commodity that is not storable, so its production and load should always be balanced to maintain a tightly regulated system frequency. Electricity production and load both depend on many factors, such as the weather, temperature, and wind. These characteristics make the dynamics of electricity price very different from that of any other commodities or financial assets. The electricity price can exhibit hourly, daily, and seasonal fluctuations, as well as abrupt unanticipated spikes. Now almost all electricity market participants use wind/load/price forecasting tools in their daily operations to optimize their operation plans, and bidding and hedging strategies, in order to maximize the profits and avoid price risks. However, the unreliable and inaccurate predictions with current forecasting tools have caused many serious problems, which can cause system instabilities and result in extreme prices even in the absence of scarcity. This paper presents an implementation of state of the art machine learning approaches into the forecasting tools for the ERCOT Day-Ahead market to improve the reliability and accuracy of electricity price prediction. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Electricity Price Forecasting; Machine Learning; Neural Networks,Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Smart power grids; System stability; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Electricity production; Forecasting tools; Hedging strategies; Machine learning approaches; Market participants; Seasonal fluctuations; Power markets,5,1,1,1,Conference,"1, 2",a
"Chen Y., Wang Y., Ma J., Jin Q.",BRIM: An accurate electricity spot price prediction scheme-based bidirectional recurrent neural network and integrated market,2019,2,"For the benefit from accurate electricity price forecasting, not only can various electricity market stakeholders make proper decisions to gain profit in a competitive environment, but also power system stability can be improved. Nevertheless, because of the high volatility and uncertainty, it is an essential challenge to accurately forecast the electricity price. Considering that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are suitable for processing time series data, in this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based forecasting model, BRIM, which splits the state neurons of a regular RNN into two parts: the forward states (using the historical electricity price information) are designed for processing the data in positive time direction and backward states (using the future price information available at inter-connected markets) for the data in negative time direction. Moreover, due to the fact that inter-connected power exchange markets show a common trend for other neighboring markets and can provide signaling information for each other, it is sensible to incorporate and exploit the impact of the neighboring markets on forecasting accuracy of electricity price. Specifically, future electricity prices of the interconnected market are utilized both as input features for forward LSTM and backward LSTM. By testing on day-ahead electricity prices in the European Power Exchange (EPEX), the experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method BRIM in enhancing predictive accuracy in comparison with the various benchmarks, and moreover Diebold-Mariano (DM) shows that the forecast accuracy of BRIM is not equal to other forecasting models, and thus indirectly demonstrates that BRIM statistically significantly outperforms other schemes. © 2019 by the authors.",Bidirectional recurrent neural network; Deep learning; Electricity price forecasting; Market integration,Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Deep learning; Forecasting; Information use; Long short-term memory; System stability; Bidirectional recurrent neural networks; Competitive environment; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Market integration; Power system stability; Power-exchange market; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Power markets,5,1,1,1,Article,2,
"Nascimento J., Pinto T., Vale Z.",Day-ahead electricity market price forecasting using artificial neural network with spearman data correlation,2019,,"Electricity markets are complex environments with very dynamic characteristics. The large-scale penetration of renewable energy sources has brought an increased uncertainty to generation, which is consequently, reflected in electricity market prices. In this way, novel advanced forecasting methods that are able to predict electricity market prices taking into account the new variables that influence prices variation are required. This paper proposes a new model for day-ahead electricity market prices forecasting based on the application of an artificial neural network. The main novelty of this paper relates to the pre-processing phase, in which the relevant data referring to the different variables that have a direct influence on market prices such as generation, temperature, consumption, among others, is analysed. The association between these variables is performed using spearman correlation, from which results the identification of which data has a larger influence on the market prices variation.

"Luo S., Weng Y.",A two-stage supervised learning approach for electricity price forecasting by leveraging different data sources,2019,10,"Over the years, the growing penetration of renewable energy into the electricity market has resulted in a significant change in the electricity market price. This change makes the existing forecasting method prone to error, decreasing the economic benefits. Hence, more precise forecasting methods need to be developed. This paper starts with a survey and benchmark of existing machine learning approaches for forecasting the real-time market (RTM) price. While these methods provide sufficient modeling capability via supervised learning, their accuracy is still limited due to the single data source, e.g., historical price information only. In this paper, a novel two-stage supervised learning approach is proposed by diversifying the data sources such as highly correlated power data. This idea is inspired by the recent load forecasting methods that have shown extremely well performances. Specifically, the proposed two-stage method, namely the rerouted method, learns two types of mapping rules. The first one is the mapping between the historical wind power and the historical price. The second is the forecasting rule for wind generation. Based on the two rules, we forecast the price via the forecasted generation and the first learned mapping between power and price. Additionally, we observed that it is not the more training data the better, leading to our validation steps to quantify the best training intervals for different datasets. We conduct comparisons of numerical results between existing methods and the proposed methods based on datasets from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). For each machine learning step, we examine different learning methods, such as polynomial regression, support vector regression, neural network, and deep neural network. The results show that the proposed method is significantly better than existing approaches when renewables are involved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electricity price forecast; Machine learning methods; Renewables; Wind power generation,Commerce; Deep neural networks; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Forecasting; Machine learning; Mapping; Power markets; Supervised learning; Tunneling (excavation); Wind power; Electric reliability council of texas; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Renewables; Supervised learning approaches; Support vector regression (SVR); Numerical methods; alternative energy; artificial neural network; electricity industry; energy planning; forecasting method; historical perspective; numerical method; price determination; supervised learning; wind power; Texas; United States,5,1,1,1,Article,6,"a, c"

"Yousefi A., Sianaki O.A., Sharafi D.",Long-Term Electricity Price Forecast Using Machine Learning Techniques,2019,,"Predicting the performance of energy commodities has long been a global priority for researchers and investors in the Energy sector. Large green field and brown field projects (often exceeding 1bn USD) are financed with locked in capital from the start, and typically take decades to return. Despite being one of the most important aspects of investment decision making, the prediction methodologies used widely today are not sophisticated enough to provide accurate insights for the investors. The new approach was proposed in this research to provide data analytics backed analysis for the performance of energy related commodities using innovative feature discovery methods and machine learning tools. In the presented research, a machine learning model was trained to predict the average monthly price of electricity in the next 5 years with focus on the California State energy market. Data points from 2001 to 2017 were collected and 78 data points are considered for analyses to select the highly-correlated features which could potentially affect the electricity price in the medium to long term. An economic case study is undertaken to understand the correlation of the features, and to avoid multicollinearity. In the next step, the selected features are applied into an S-ARIMA time series prediction algorithm. In addition, several feature-based machine learning algorithms are applied to the data and the results analysed and compared to find the effective forcasting approach. The findings demonstrated promising results for three years future price prediction horizon.

"Chai S., Xu Z., Jia Y.",Conditional Density Forecast of Electricity Price Based on Ensemble ELM and Logistic EMOS,2019,13,"In recent years, probabilistic forecast of electricity price has become of particular interests to market participants as it can effectively model the uncertainties due to competitive market behaviors. Decision makers heavily rely on such forecast to formulate optimal strategies with minimal risk and maximum profits to deal with stochasticity in market and system operation. Different from the widely used volatility models with least square or maximum likelihood techniques in probabilistic forecast of prices, this paper proposes a reliable continuous ranked probability score-oriented predictive density construction strategy for day-ahead electricity prices. The proposed method effectively quantifies the uncertainty involved in extreme learning machine network by applying an ensemble structure and a logistic distribution-based ensemble model output statistics technique. Moreover, an efficient covariance structure directly determined by the empirical correlations of observed probabilistic forecast series is developed to capture the essential temporal interdependence thus to facilitate the operational scenarios' generation.

"Díaz G., Coto J., Gómez-Aleixandre J.",Prediction and explanation of the formation of the Spanish day-ahead electricity price through machine learning regression,2019,6,"Until recently, detailed information on the power system state to estimate future spot prices by regression analysis was generally restricted to qualified parties. However, to ensure transparency in operation, the Spanish Transmission System Operator has launched an informative web in which a sizable amount of real-time energy-related data can be consulted through a graphical interface. Undoubtedly, this provides the opportunity for non-qualified parties to develop applications and algorithms in which price forecast and maybe knowledge about how price is determined are required. This paper approaches the use of data extracted from that interface with two aims: the prediction of the day-ahead price in a simple way, and the exploration of the influence that the underlying energy drivers have on it. For the prediction we specified a quantile regression model based on Gradient Boosted Regression Trees. It improves the accuracy over multiple linear regression models at the cost of more complexity, and still it has simpler specification and tuning compared to other machine learning approaches. The calculated metrics show that our model produces remarkably low prediction errors when using the median as point prediction method (RMSE = 2.78 €/MWh, MAE = 1.94 €/MWh, and MAPE = 0.059). Interestingly, the quantile regression model also allows to inherently define prediction intervals, with a different interpretation of accuracy. Our results show that on average 90% of times the prediction error will not exceed 6.8 €/MWh. We also implemented a partial dependence analysis on that model. This implementation—as far as we know the first time employed to analyze the formation of electricity prices—has shown to be of significant usefulness in detecting highly non-linear relationships. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Day-ahead electricity price; Gradient boosting regression; Linear regression; Principal components; Quantile regression,Costs; Electric power transmission; Forecasting; Linear regression; Machine learning; Electricity prices; Gradient boosting; Machine learning approaches; Multiple linear regression models; Non-linear relationships; Principal Components; Quantile regression; Transmission system operators; Power markets; electricity; energy market; exploration; machine learning; operations technology; prediction; principal component analysis; regression analysis; Spain,5,1,1,2,Article,7,

In stage I, discrete wavelet transform (db4, level 3) is applied for decomposing the prices of electricity data to a set of constitutive for reducing the variation in the prices data. In stage II, ANFIS is used to forecast the electricity prices. KHA has been adopted in updating the various weights in the ANFIS to get better accuracy.

"Naz A., Javed M.U., Javaid N., Saba T., Alhussein M., Aurangzeb K.",Short-term electric load and price forecasting using enhanced extreme learning machine optimization in smart grids,2019,15,"A Smart Grid (SG) is a modernized grid to provide efficient, reliable and economic energy to the consumers. Energy is the most important resource in the world. An efficient energy distribution is required as smart devices are increasing dramatically. The forecasting of electricity consumption is supposed to be a major constituent to enhance the performance of SG. Various learning algorithms have been proposed to solve the forecasting problem. The sole purpose of this work is to predict the price and load efficiently. The first technique is Enhanced Logistic Regression (ELR) and the second technique is Enhanced Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (ERELM). ELR is an enhanced form of Logistic Regression (LR), whereas, ERELM optimizes weights and biases using a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Relief-F and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) are used for feature selection and extraction. On the basis of selected features, classification is performed using ELR. Cross validation is done for ERELM using Monte Carlo and K-Fold methods. The simulations are performed on two different datasets. The first dataset, i.e., UMass Electric Dataset is multi-variate while the second dataset, i.e., UCI Dataset is uni-variate. The first proposed model performed better with UMass Electric Dataset than UCI Dataset and the accuracy of second model is better with UCI than UMass. The prediction accuracy is analyzed on the basis of four different performance metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed techniques are then compared with four benchmark schemes. The comparison is done to verify the adaptivity of the proposed techniques. The simulation results show that the proposed techniques outperformed benchmark schemes. The proposed techniques efficiently increased the prediction accuracy of load and price. However, the computational time is increased in both scenarios. ELR achieved almost 5% better results than Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and almost 3% than LR. While, ERELM achieved almost 6% better results than ELM and almost 5% than RELM. However, the computational time is almost 20% increased with ELR and 50% with ERELM. Scalability is also addressed for the proposed techniques using half-yearly and yearly datasets. Simulation results show that ELR gives 5% better results while, ERELM gives 6% better results when used for yearly dataset. © 2019 by the authors.",CNN; ELR; ERELM; Forecasting; Load; LR; Price; RELM; Smart grid,Electric load forecasting; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Errors; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Lawrencium; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Loading; Mean square error; Monte Carlo methods; Neural networks; Power markets; Regression analysis; Classification and regression tree; ERELM; Feature selection and extractions; Mean absolute percentage error; Price; Recursive feature elimination; RELM; Smart grid; Smart power grids,5,1,1,1,Article,2,

The selection of the short-term type input variable applies the Pearson correlation coefficient.

"Ghayekhloo M., Azimi R., Ghofrani M., Menhaj M.B., Shekari E.",A combination approach based on a novel data clustering method and Bayesian recurrent neural network for day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets,2019,6,"Electricity price forecasting is an ancillary service that plays a key role for market participants in a deregulated structure. Compared to other commodities, electricity price exhibits higher levels of volatility and uncertainty. This imposes more restrictions on the accuracy of the forecast and leads to significant errors. This paper proposes a hybrid electricity price-forecasting framework with a novel time series data mining method to enhance the feature selection. The proposed method includes clustering, preprocessing and training stages. The proposed data clustering method uses both an enhanced game theoretic approach and neural gas in combination with competitive Hebbian learning to provide a better vector quantization. Six strategies are proposed to enable the non-winning neurons to participate in the learning phase and resolve the shortcomings of the original self-organizing map, where the dead neurons are far from the input patterns without having any chance to compete with the winning neurons. The price-load input data are clustered into a proper number of subsets using the proposed data mining method. A novel cluster selection method based on the persistence approach is applied to select the most appropriate cluster as the input to the BRNN. The selected data set is filtered by the harmonic analysis time series, and is time-series processed to provide the proper inputs for training neural networks. Bayesian approach is used to train a recurrent neural network, and forecast the electricity price. The performance of the proposed clustering algorithm is evaluated using different electricity market data. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed clustering algorithm as compared to K-means, neural gas and self-organizing map clustering methods Our proposed clustering provides 16.7%, 28.6%, and 13% more accurate results than K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map for the NYISO. CAPITL data. For the NYISO. CENTRL data, the developed clustering outperforms the K-means, neural gas, and self-organizing map by 21.4%, 21.4%, and 8.3%, respectively.

"Mujeeb S., Javaid N., Ilahi M., Wadud Z., Ishmanov F., Afzal M.K.",Deep long short-term memory: A new price and load forecasting scheme for big data in smart cities,2019,23,"This paper focuses on analytics of an extremely large dataset of smart grid electricity price and load, which is difficult to process with conventional computational models. These data are known as energy big data. The analysis of big data divulges the deeper insights that help experts in the improvement of smart grid's (SG) operations. Processing and extracting of meaningful information from data is a challenging task. Electricity load and price are the most influential factors in the electricity market. For improving reliability, control and management of electricity market operations, an exact estimate of the day ahead load is a substantial requirement. Energy market trade is based on price. Accurate price forecast enables energy market participants to make effective and most profitable bidding strategies. This paper proposes a deep learning-based model for the forecast of price and demand for big data using Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM). Due to the adaptive and automatic feature learning mechanism of Deep Neural Network (DNN), the processing of big data is easier with LSTM as compared to the purely data-driven methods. The proposed model was evaluated using well-known real electricity markets' data. In this study, day and week ahead forecasting experiments were conducted for all months. Forecast performance was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). The proposed Deep LSTM (DLSTM) method was compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) time series forecasting methods, i.e., Nonlinear Autoregressive network with Exogenous variables (NARX) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). DLSTM outperformed the compared forecasting methods in terms of accuracy. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method for electricity price and load forecasting. © 2019 by the authors.",Big data; Electricity load; Long Short-Term Memory LSTM; Price forecasting; Smart grid,artificial neural network; data set; electricity; energy market; forecasting method; price determination; profitability; smart city,5,1,1,1,Article,2,
"Cerjan M., Petričić A., Delimar M.",HIRA model for short-term electricity price forecasting,2019,3,"In competitive power markets, electric utilities, power producers, and traders are exposed to increased risks caused by electricity price volatility. The growing reliance on renewable sources and their dependence on weather, nuclear uncertainty, market coupling, and global financial instability are contributing to the importance of accurate electricity price forecasting. Since power markets are not all equally developed, different price forecasting methods have been introduced for individual markets. The aim of this research is to introduce a short-term electricity price forecasting method that addresses the problems of price volatility, a varying number of input parameters, varying data availability, and a large number of parameters and input data. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used on any market as it targets the characteristics and specifics of each market. The proposed Hybrid Iterative Reactive Adaptive (HIRA) method consists of two phases. In analysis phase, fundamental parameters which affect the electricity price are identified depending on market development. Obtained parameters are used as data inputs for price forecasting using a hybrid method. The HIRA model combines a statistical approach for large data set analysis and a similar day method with neural network tools. Similar days are examined using a statistical method which combines correlation significance, price volatility, and forecasting accuracy of the historical data. Data are collected based on their availability and electricity prices are forecasted in several iterations. All relevant data for price forecasting are collected, categorized, and arranged using simple indicators which makes the HIRA model adaptive and reactive to new market circumstances. The proposed model is validated using the Hungarian Power Exchange (HUPX) electricity price data records. The results show that with HIRA model forecasting, the error is stable and does not depend on price volatility. The HIRA method has proven to be applicable for forecasting electricity prices in real-time market conditions and enables effective hedging of price risk in the production or market portfolio. © 2019 by the authors.",Data mining; Dynamic hybrid model; Electricity market; Electricity price; Neural network; Short-term electricity price forecast; Spot market,Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Electric utilities; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Competitive power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity price volatilities; Electricity prices; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting electricity; Hybrid model; Spot market; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article,1,a

Consequentially, challenges for profitability as well as correct management of the electricity sector have increased its complexity. The use of forecasting tools that allow a real and robust approach makes it possible to improve system operation and thus minimizing costs associated with the activities of the electric sector. Hence, the forecasting approaches have an essential role in all stages of the electricity markets.

"Yang W., Wang J., Niu T., Du P.",A hybrid forecasting system based on a dual decomposition strategy and multi-objective optimization for electricity price forecasting,2019,48,"Electricity price forecasting plays a crucial role in balancing electricity generation and consumption, which is of great political and economic significance for all of society but is still a challenging task. However, in previous studies, most researchers have focused on improving either forecasting accuracy or stability while ignoring the significance of performing these tasks simultaneously. More importantly, few researchers have deeply studied the data preprocessing strategy, only focusing on the application of individual decomposition approaches. Therefore, a novel hybrid forecasting system based on a dual decomposition strategy and multi-objective optimization is developed for electricity price forecasting that includes four modules: a data preprocessing module, optimization module, forecasting module and evaluation module. In this system, an effective multi-objective optimization algorithm is employed to guarantee simultaneous improvements in accuracy and stability. In addition, an improved data preprocessing approach named the dual decomposition strategy is developed, which successfully overcomes the potential drawback of the individual decomposition approach and further improves the effectiveness of the developed forecasting system. Moreover, the evaluation module is incorporated to verify the superiority of the developed forecasting system. Case studies utilizing half-hourly electricity price data collected from New South Wales, Australia are employed as examples. The results prove the superiority of the multi-objective optimization algorithm and the developed dual decomposition strategy and reveal that the developed forecasting system outperforms all of the considered comparison models, which shows its better ability to forecast future electricity prices with better accuracy and stability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Dual decomposition strategy; Electricity price forecasting system; Forecasting accuracy and stability; Multi-objective optimization algorithm,"Forecasting; Power markets; System stability; Decomposition approach; Dual decomposition; Electricity generation; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Multi-objective optimization algorithms; New South Wales , Australia; Optimization module; Multiobjective optimization; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data processing; decomposition analysis; electricity; electricity generation; forecasting method; optimization; price dynamics; Australia; New South Wales",5,1,1,1,Article,2,
"de Marcos R.A., Bello A., Reneses J.",Electricity price forecasting in the short term hybridising fundamental and econometric modelling,2019,8,"Traders and practitioners in diverse power exchanges are nowadays being most exposed to uncertainty than ever. The combination of several factors such as renewable generation and regulatory changes calls for suitable electricity price forecasting models that can deal with complex and unusual market conditions. Several authors have proposed combining fundamental approaches with econometric models in order to cover all relevant aspects for electricity price forecasting. This combination has shown positive results for medium-term horizons. However, this approach has rarely been carried out for short-term applications. Moreover, several day-to-day applications in electricity markets require fast responsiveness and accurate forecasts. All of these facts encourage this work's short-term hybrid electricity price forecasting model, which combines a cost-production optimisation (fundamental) model with an artificial neural network (econometric) model. In order to validate the advantages and contributions of the proposed model, it has been applied to a real-size power exchange with complex price dynamics, such as the Iberian electricity market. Moreover, its forecasting performance has been compared with those of the two individual components of the hybrid model as well as other well-recognised methods.

However, due to the complex drivers and sharp fluctuation of electricity prices, accurate electricity price forecasting turns to be very difficult. To better capture the characteristics of day-ahead electricity prices, a new integrated model based on the improved empirical mode decomposition (IEMD), autoregressive moving average with exogenous terms (ARMAX), exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (EGARCH) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed in this paper.

"Wang F., Li K., Zhou L., Ren H., Contreras J., Shafie-khah M., Catalão J.P.S.",Daily pattern prediction based classification modeling approach for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2019,48,"Day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) plays a very important role in the decision-making optimization of electricity market participants, the dispatch control of independent system operators (ISOs) and the strategy formulation of energy trading. Unified modeling that only fits a single mapping relation between the historical data and future data usually produces larger errors because the different fluctuation patterns in electricity price data show different mapping relations. A daily pattern prediction (DPP) based classification modeling approach for DAEPF is proposed to solve this problem. The basic idea is that first recognize the price pattern of the next day from the “rough” day-ahead forecasting results provided by conventional forecasting methods and then perform classification modeling to further improve the forecasting accuracy through building a specific forecasting model for each pattern. The proposed approach consists of four steps. First, K-means is utilized to group all the historical daily electricity price curves into several clusters in order to assign each daily curve a pattern label for the training of the following daily pattern recognition (DPR) model and classification modeling. Second, a DPP model is proposed to recognize the price pattern of the next day from the forecasting results provided by multiple conventional forecasting methods. A weighted voting mechanism (WVM) method is proposed in this step to combine multiple day-ahead pattern predictions to obtain a more accurate DPP result. Third, the classification forecasting model of each different daily pattern can be established according to the clustering results in step 1. Fourth, the credibility of DPP result is checked to eventually determine whether the proposed classification DAEPF modeling approach can be adopted or not. A case study using the real electricity price data from the PJM market indicates that the proposed approach presents a better performance than unified modeling for a certain daily pattern whose DPP results show high reliability and accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Classification modeling; Daily pattern prediction; Day-ahead forecasting; Electricity price; Weighted voting mechanism,Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Decision making; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Mapping; Pattern recognition; Classification models; Day-ahead; Decision-making optimization; Different mapping relation; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Independent system operators; Weighted voting; Power markets,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article,"1, 7",c

The forecasting is done for 212 days from the beginning of 2017 and past data from 2016 is used. For forecasting, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Trigonometric Seasonal Box-Cox Transformation with ARMA residuals Trend and Seasonal Components (TBATS) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) methods are used and seasonal naïve forecast is utilized as a benchmark. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are used as accuracy criterions. ARIMA and ANN are utilized with external variables and variable analysis is realized in order to improve forecasting results. As a result of variable analysis, it was observed that excluding temperature from external variables helped improve forecasting results. In terms of mean error ARIMA yielded the best results while ANN had the lowest minimum error and standard deviation. TBATS performed better than ANN in terms of mean error. To further improve forecasting accuracy, the three forecasts were combined using simple averaging and ANN methods and they were both found to be beneficial, with simple averaging having better accuracy.

LSTM network has been widely used in various applications such as natural language processing and time series analysis. It is capable of learning features and long term dependencies of the historical information on the current predictions for sequential data. We propose to use LSTM model to forecast the day-ahead electricity price for Australian market at Victoria (VIC) region and Singapore market. Instead of using only historical prices as inputs to the model, we also consider exogenous variables, such as holidays, day of the week, hour of the day, weather conditions, oil prices and historical price/demand, etc. The output is the electricity price for the next hour. The future 24 hours of prices are forecasted in a recursive manner. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of four weeks for each season in VIC and Singapore markets are examined. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using real market data from both markets.

Accurate forecasting can make precise economically beneficial decision not only in efficient resource scheduling, but also in real-time energy arbitrage. To maximize the profit, the idea is to buy energy at low price and sell at high. However, it is very complex and volatile task since the electricity prices are highly fluctuating in nature as a result of bidding competition among the suppliers and consumers in the electricity market.

Then a Kohonen Self Organizing Map (SOM) finds similar days of load frequency components and feeds them into the second stage forecasting machine. In addition, mutual information based feature selection is used to find the relevant price data and rank them based on their relevance. The second stage uses Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for forecasting of load and price frequency components, respectively. The third stage machine uses the second stage outputs and feeds them into its MLP-ANN and ANFIS machines to improve the load and price forecasting accuracy.

"Ben Amor S., Boubaker H., Belkacem L.",Forecasting electricity spot price for Nord Pool market with a hybrid k-factor GARMA–LLWNN model,2018,1,"This paper proposes a new hybrid approach, based on the combination of parametric and nonparametric models by adopting wavelet estimation approach, to model and predict the price electricity for Nord Pool market. Our hybrid methodology consists into two steps. The first step aims at modeling the conditional mean of the time series, using a generalized fractional model with k-factor of Gegenbauer termed the k-factor GARMA model; the parameters of this model are estimated using the wavelet approach based on the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT). The second step aims at estimating the conditional variance, so we adopt the local linear wavelet neural network (LLWNN) model. The proposed hybrid model is tested using the hourly log-returns of electricity spot price from the Nord Pool market. The empirical results were compared with the predictions of the ARFIMA–LLWNN, the k-factor GARMA–FIGARCH and the individual LLWNN models. It is shown that the proposed hybrid k-factor GARMA–LLWNN model outperforms all other competing methods. Hence it is a robust tool in forecasting time series. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",electricity price; forecasting; hybrid; k-factor GARMA; LLWNN,Commerce; Forecasting; Lakes; Parameter estimation; Power markets; Time series; Discrete wavelet packet transforms; Electricity prices; Forecasting electricity; Forecasting time series; hybrid; K-factor GARMA; LLWNN; Wavelet neural networks; Telecommunication traffic,"4, 5","1, 2",1,1,Article,1,a
"Anamika, Peesapati R., Kumar N.",Electricity Price Forecasting and Classification Through Wavelet-Dynamic Weighted PSO-FFNN Approach,2018,11,"In competitive electricity markets, accurate price forecasting is required to both power producers and consumers for planning their bidding strategies in order to maximize their own benefits. Price classification is an alternative approach to forecasting where the exact values of future prices are not mandatory. Presently, two efficient algorithms are proposed for both short term price forecasting (STPF) and classification (STPC) purposes. The algorithms include various methodologies like wavelet transform (WT), fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization (FA-PSO) and feed forward neural networks (FFNN). WT is utilized to convert the pathetic price series to an inviolable price series without losing the originality in the signal. Standard PSO (S-PSO) is implemented to tune the fixed architecture FFNN weights and biases. In the present nonlinear problem, linear variation of inertia weight does not resemble exact search process. Hence, dynamic inertia weight is accomplished by implementing the fuzzy systems in the S-PSO approach. The hybrid methodology is implemented on Spanish electricity markets for the year 2002. To validate, three types of price classes and historical price series that are utilized by many researches as input features, are considered. Various statistical indicators are evaluated to compare and validate the proposed approaches with the past approaches available in the literature survey. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",Forecasting; fuzzy systems; neural networks (NN); particle swarm optimization (PSO); wavelet transform (WT),Biological systems; Commerce; Costs; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Neurons; Power markets; Wavelet transforms; Auto regressive process; Biological system modeling; Computational model; Neural network (nn); Predictive models; Particle swarm optimization (PSO),5,2,1,1,Article,3,
"Paulos J.P., Fidalgo J.N.",Load and electricity prices forecasting using generalized regression neural networks,2018,1,"Over time, the electricity price and energy consumption are increasingly growing their weight as prime foundations of the electrical sector, with their analysis and forecasts being targeted as key elements for the stable maintenance of electricity markets. The advent of smart grids is escalating the importance of forecasting because of the expected ubiquitous monitoring and growing complexity of a data-rich ever-changing milieu. So, the increasing data volatility will require forecasting tools able to rapidly readjust to a dynamic environment. The Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) approach is a solution that has recently re-emerged, emphasizing good performance, fast run-times and ease of parameterization. The merging of this model with more conventional methods allows us to obtain more sturdy solutions with shortened training times, when compared to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Overall, the performance of the GRNN, although slightly inferior to that of the ANN, is suitable, but linked to much lower training times. Ultimately, the GRNN would be a proper solution to blend with the latest smart grids features, which may require much reduced forecasting training times. © 2018 IEEE.",Data sampling; electricity prices forecasting; load forecasting; neural networks; performance evaluation,Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Neural networks; Power markets; Smart power grids; Conventional methods; Data sampling; Dynamic environments; Electricity prices forecasting; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Generalized regression neural networks; Load forecasting; Performance evaluations; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1,Conference,1,a

While many predictive models have been already proposed to perform this task, the area of deep learning algorithms remains yet unexplored. To fill this scientific gap, we propose four different deep learning models for predicting electricity prices and we show how they lead to improvements in predictive accuracy.

An hour-ahead forecast provides market participants with the pre-dispatch prices for the next hour.

In particular, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are tailor-made for time series price estimation. In this paper, we propose to use multi-layer Gated Recurrent Units as a new technique for electricity price forecasting.

In this paper we try to incorporate this uncertainty in the electricity price forecasting model by applying interval numbers to express the price of electricity, with no intention of exploring influencing factors. This paper represents a hybrid model based on fuzzy C-mean clustering and the interval-valued autoregressive process for forecasting the short-term electricity price. A fuzzy C-mean algorithm was used to create interval time series to be forecasted by the interval autoregressive process. In this way, the efficiency of forecasting is improved because we predict the interval, not the crisp value where the price will be.

In medium term forecast, electricity price can be predicted for several weeks ahead up to a year or few months ahead. It is useful for resources reallocation where the market players have to manage the price risk on the expected market scenario. However, researches on medium term price forecast have also exhibited low forecast accuracy. This is due to the limited historical data for training and testing purposes. Therefore, an optimisation technique of Genetic Algorithm (GA) for Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) was developed in this study to provide an accurate electricity price forecast with optimised LSSVM parameters and input features. So far, no literature has been found on feature and parameter selections using the method of LSSVM-GA for medium term price prediction.

Once sellers and buyers access an accurate price forecasting, managing the economic risk can be conducted appropriately through offering or bidding suitable prices. In networks with high wind power penetration, the electricity price is influenced by wind energy; therefore, price forecasting can be more complicated. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for price forecasting of day-ahead markets, with high penetration of wind generators based on Wavelet transform, bivariate Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN). To this end, a weighted time series for wind dominated power systems is calculated and added to a bivariate ARIMA model along with the price time series. Moreover, RBFN is applied as a tool to correct the estimation error, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the structure and adapt the RBFN to the particular training set. This method is evaluated on the Spanish electricity market, which shows the efficiency of this approach.

In particular, periods with low and high price levels are difficult to predict due to a limited number of representative cases in the historical dataset, which leads to forecast bias problems and wide forecast intervals. Moreover, these markets also require the inclusion of multiple explanatory variables, which increases the complexity of the model without guaranteeing a forecasting skill improvement.

"Guo W., Zhao Z.",A novel hybrid BND-FOA-LSSVM model for electricity price forecasting,2017,6,"Accurate electricity price forecasting plays an important role in the profits of electricity market participants and the healthy development of electricity market. However, the electricity price time series hold the characteristics of volatility and randomness, which make it quite hard to forecast electricity price accurately. In this paper, a novel hybrid model for electricity price forecasting was proposed combining Beveridge-Nelson decomposition (BND) method, fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) model, namely BND-FOA-LSSVM model. Firstly, the original electricity price time series were decomposed into deterministic term, periodic term, and stochastic term by using BND model. Then, these three decomposed terms were forecasted by employing LSSVM model, respectively. Meanwhile, to improve the forecasting performance, a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm FOA was used to automatically determine the optimal parameters of LSSVM model for deterministic term forecasting, periodic term forecasting, and stochastic term forecasting. Finally, the forecasting result of electricity price can be obtained by multiplying the forecasting values of these three terms. The results show the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the proposed BND-FOA-LSSVM model are respectively 3.48%, 11.18 Yuan/MWh and 9.95 Yuan/MWh, which are much smaller than that of LSSVM, BND-LSSVM, FOA-LSSVM, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-FOA-LSSVM models.

In this paper, a hybrid intelligent method is proposed to provide one-step ahead predicted values of electricity price with a couple of strategies; Fuzzy c-Varieties and improved GRBFN. The former is used to classify input data into some fuzzy clusters while the latter is employed to provide the predicted electricity price at each cluster by applying Deterministic Annealing clustering to the determination of the initial values of parameters in the Gaussian functions. The reason why Fuzzy c-Varieties are used is to increases the number of data by allowing each data to be belonged to more than two clusters.

"Peter S.E., Raglend I.J.",Sequential wavelet-ANN with embedded ANN-PSO hybrid electricity price forecasting model for Indian energy exchange,2017,8,"This research paper presents a novel sequential wavelet-artificial neural network (ANN) with embedded ANN-particle swarm optimization (PSO) for short-term day-ahead forecasting of market clearing price (MCP) in the Indian energy exchange. A precise price forecasting helps suppliers to set up bidding strategies, make investment decisions and be cautious against risks. Conversely, consumers can use price forecasting to exploit appropriate power purchasing strategies for maximum utility utilization. Here the most influential historical data, namely purchase bid and MCP, are considered for training the feed-forward back-propagation neural network. The proposed model involves three sequential phases. Initially, the raw historical data are smoothened by removing the high-frequency components using a wavelet transform method which may enable better training of neural network. Then, ANN is used to train historical patterns. More number of trials is carried out, and the final weights that give the least training error are stored. In the final phase, the stored weights that are obtained from various trials are used as the initial population for the embedded ANN-PSO model. Here the performance of the proposed forecasting model is carried out using three error indices, namely mean absolute percentage error, normalized mean square error and error variance. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Artificial neural networks; Mean absolute percentage error; Particle swarm optimization; Wavelet transform,Backpropagation; Costs; Errors; Forecasting; Investments; Mean square error; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Wavelet transforms; Electricity price forecasting; Feed-forward back-propagation neural networks; Forecasting modeling; High frequency components; Investment decisions; Market clearing prices; Mean absolute percentage error; Normalized mean square error; Power markets,5,1,1,1,Article,1,a
"Li P., Arci F., Reilly J., Curran K., Belatreche A., Shynkevich Y.",Predicting short-term wholesale prices on the Irish single electricity market with artificial neural networks,2017,3,"The ability to operate effectively on electricity spot markets relies on the capability to devise appropriate bidding strategies. These in turn can benefit from the inclusion of a reliable forecast of short term system marginal prices (SMPs). In a market with an increasing percentage of renewable generators, reliable forecasts must necessarily consider additional factors such as meteorological forecasts, forecasted demand and constraints imposed by network topology. Traditional time series forecasting algorithms (e.g. based on AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models) can perform reasonably well in this context but rely on assumptions being made on behavior over different temporal windows to yield consistent results. Research studies have demonstrated that an adaptive or self-adaptive approach to forecasting would appear more suited to the task of predicting energy demands in territory such as Ireland. Implementing an in-house self-adaptive model should yield good results in the dynamic uncertain Irish energy market. We have identified the features that such a model demands and outline it here. © 2017 IEEE.",,Commerce; Forecasting; Neural networks; Shape memory effect; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Electricity spot market; Renewable generators; Self adaptive approach; Self-adaptive models; System marginal price; Time series forecasting; Whole sale prices; Power markets,5,1,1,1,Conference,1,a

A stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA) model, a class of deep neural networks, and its extended version are utilized to forecast the electricity price hourly. Data collected in Nebraska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Indiana hubs in U.S. are utilized. Two types of forecasting, the online hourly forecasting and day-ahead hourly forecasting, are examined. In online forecasting, SDA models are compared with data-driven approaches including the classical neural networks, support vector machine, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. In the day-ahead forecasting, the effectiveness of SDA models is further validated through comparing with industrial results and a recently reported method.

This provides forward planning of their bidding strategies in order to maximise revenue, profit, and utility perspectives. Nevertheless, due to the non-stationarities involved in market clearing price, an accurate forecasting of these prices is very complex. In this case, transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval ones is of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts. In this study, interval forecasting of market clearing prices is conducted based on a novel approach within two consecutive steps. In the first step, a new hybrid method is proposed to estimate point forecasts: combination of wavelet transformation (Wt), feature selection based on Mutual Information (MI), extreme learning machine (ELM), and bootstrap approaches in an ensemble structure is employed. The second step consists of the following stepwise parts: calculating the variance of the model uncertainties based on the extracted data from the ensemble structure, estimating the noise variance by using the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), and improving the accuracy of interval forecasting by using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach termed as Wt-mutual information-ELM-MLE-PSO is validated through electricity market real data of Australian electricity network from real-time and day-ahead market viewpoints. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Electric industry; Learning algorithms; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Uncertainty analysis; Australian electricities; Extreme learning machine; Interval forecasting; Market Clearing Price; Model uncertainties; Mutual informations; Particle swarm optimisation; Wavelet transformations; Forecasting,5,1,"1, 2",2,Article,1,b

Day-ahead prediction provides forecast prices for a day ahead that is useful for daily operation and decision-making. The main challenge for day ahead price forecasting is the accuracy and efficiency. Lower accuracy is produced due to the nature of electricity price that is highly volatile compared to load series. Hence, some researchers have developed complex procedures to produce accurate forecast while considering significant features and optimum parameters. Therefore, a multistage optimization for hybrid Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model is developed in this study to provide an accurate price forecast with optimized parameters and input features. So far, no literature has been found on multistage feature and parameter selections using the methods of LSSVM-GA for day-ahead price prediction.

"Gupta S., Chitkara P.",Day ahead price forecasting models in thin electricity market,2017,2,"Day Ahead Electricity Markets (DAMs) in India are thin but growing. Consistent price forecasts are important for their utilization in portfolio optimization models. Univariate or multivariate models with standard exogenous variables such as special day effects etc. are not always useful. Drivers of demand and supply include weather variations over large geographic areas, outages of power system elements and sudden changes in contracts which lead the players to access power exchanges. These needs to be considered in forecasting models. Such models are observed to considerably reduce forecasting errors by outperforming other models under conditions, which are neither infrequent nor recur at defined intervals.

To fulfill this aim, we define the seasonal autoregressive neural network (SAR-NN) as a dynamic feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), essentially conceived to forecast electricity prices. The SAR-NN is an ANN-based autoregressive model that considers that autoregressors are only those that are lagged by a multiple of the period p of the dominating seasonality. Moving forward this neural network, step-by-step, allows to generate multiple-steps-ahead reliable forecasts. This model is specifically designed to robustly overcome the strong seasonal effects and the other nonlinear patterns that often harm ANNs forecasting performance.

"Varshney H., Sharma A., Kumar R.",A hybrid approach to price forecasting incorporating exogenous variables for a day ahead electricity Market,2017,7,"Predicting Location Based Market Price (LBMP) in real time is an important and complex task that involves a great accuracy to model extreme spikes. Occurrence of spikes in real time LBMP is due to uncertainty in load demand as well as a significant variation in surrounding temperature throughout the day. These fluctuations cause extreme spikes in market clearing price due to transmission outages, shortage of supply and consumption of costly generation reserves. Therefore, the market participants are forced to purchase the electricity at very high price but the regulation set on the price cap by market authorities results into an economic loss to retailers and market participants. Accordingly, accurate forecasting of price is an important exercise to hedge against volatility.

"Itaba S., Mori H.",A Fuzzy-Preconditioned GRBFN Model for Electricity Price Forecasting,2017,5,"This paper proposes a fuzzy-preconditioned ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model for electricity price forecasting. The deregulated electric power systems have been widely spread to trade electric power through electric power markets. The market players are interested in gaining the inside track to maximize the profits and minimize risks in advance. One of the most important tasks is how to forecast a complicated time series of electricity price that affects transmission network congestion. In practice, it is hard to forecast electricity price with the spikes due to the high nonlinearity. In this paper, GRBFN (General Radial Basis Function Network) of ANN is proposed for electricity price forecasting. It is an extension of RBFN of ANN in a way that the optimal parameters of the Gaussian functions are determined by the learning process in RBFN. To improve the model accuracy of GRBFN, FCE (fuzzy c-Elliptotypes) is introduced into GRBFN as a fuzzy precondition technique. FCE is an extension of FCM (fuzzy c-means) and plays a key role to classify input data into fuzzy clusters. The use of FCE contributes to the improvement of model accuracy for spikes of electricity price that bring about much higher price. This paper makes use of DA clustering to evaluate a better initial solution of the parameters of the Gaussian functions. Also, EPSO of evolutionary computation is used to evaluate better weights between neurons. The proposed method is successfully applied to real data of electricity price. © 2017 The Author(s).",artificial neural network; DA clustering; electricity price; EPSO; evolutionary computation; fuzzy c-Elliptotypes; fuzzy clustering; global clustering; GRBFN; power markets; RBFN; spikes; time-series forecasting,Adaptive systems; Commerce; Complex networks; Costs; Deregulation; Electric power systems; Embedded systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Function evaluation; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy inference; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Time series; DA clustering; Electricity prices; EPSO; fuzzy c-Elliptotypes; Global clustering; GRBFN; RBFN; spikes; Time series forecasting; Power markets,5,1,1,1,Conference,"1, 3",c

"Domanski P.D., Gintrowski M.",Alternative approaches to the prediction of electricity prices,2017,8,"Purpose: This paper aims to present the results of the comparison between different approaches to the prediction of electricity prices. It is well-known that the properties of the data generation process may prefer some modeling methods over the others. The data having an origin in social or market processes are characterized by unexpectedly wide realization space resulting in the existence of the long tails in the probabilistic density function. These data may not be easy in time series prediction using standard approaches based on the normal distribution assumptions. The electricity prices on the deregulated market fall into this category. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents alternative approaches, i.e. memory-based prediction and fractal approach compared with established nonlinear method of neural networks. The appropriate interpretation of results is supported with the statistical data analysis and data conditioning. These algorithms have been applied to the problem of the energy price prediction on the deregulated electricity market with data from Polish and Austrian energy stock exchanges. Findings: The first outcome of the analysis is that there are several situations in the task of time series prediction, when standard modeling approach based on the assumption that each change is independent of the last following random Gaussian bell pattern may not be a true. In this paper, such a case was considered: price data from energy markets. Electricity prices data are biased by the human nature. It is shown that more relevant for data properties was Cauchy probabilistic distribution. Results have shown that alternative approaches may be used and prediction for both data memory-based approach resulted in the best performance. Research limitations/implications: “Personalization” of the model is crucial aspect in the whole methodology. All available knowledge should be used on the forecasted phenomenon and incorporate it into the model. In case of the memory-based modeling, it is a specific design of the history searching routine that uses the understanding of the process features. Importance should shift toward methodology structure design and algorithm customization and then to parameter estimation. Such modeling approach may be more descriptive for the user enabling understanding of the process and further iterative improvement in a continuous striving for perfection. Practical implications: Memory-based modeling can be practically applied. These models have large potential that is worth to be exploited. One disadvantage of this modeling approach is large calculation effort connected with a need of constant evaluation of large data sets. It was shown that a graphics processing unit (GPU) approach through parallel calculation on the graphical cards can improve it dramatically. Social implications: The modeling of the electricity prices has big impact of the daily operation of the electricity traders and distributors. From one side, appropriate modeling can improve performance mitigating risks associated with the process. Thus, the end users should receive higher quality of services ultimately with lower prices and minimized risk of the energy loss incidents. Originality/value: The use of the alternative approaches, such as memory-based reasoning or fractals, is very rare in the field of the electricity price forecasting. Thus, it gives a new impact for further research enabling development of better solutions incorporating all available process knowledge and customized hybrid algorithms. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Artificial intelligence; Econometric; Energy sector; Forecasting; Modelling; Neural networks; Pricing; Time series analysis,Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Deregulation; Electronic trading; Energy dissipation; Forecasting; Fractals; Graphics processing unit; Iterative methods; Models; Neural networks; Normal distribution; Power markets; Probability distributions; Program processors; Time series analysis; Deregulated electricity market; Design/methodology/approach; Econometric; Electricity price forecasting; Energy sector; Probabilistic density function; Probabilistic distribution; Statistical data analysis; Costs,5,1,1,1,Article,1,a

However, electricity price series usually has complex features such as non-linearity, non-stationarity and volatility, which makes the price forecasting turn out to be very difficult. In order to improve the accuracy of electricity price forecasting, this paper first proposes a two-layer decomposition technique and then develops a hybrid model based on fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition (FEEMD), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and back propagation (BP) neural network optimized by firefly algorithm (FA). The proposed model is unique in the sense that VMD is specifically applied to further decompose the high frequency intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) generated by FEEMD into a number of modes in order to improve the forecast accuracy.

"Yang Z., Ce L., Lian L.","Electricity price forecasting by a hybrid model, combining wavelet transform, ARMA and kernel-based extreme learning machine methods",2017,138,"Electricity prices have rather complex features such as high volatility, high frequency, nonlinearity, mean reversion and non-stationarity that make forecasting very difficult. However, accurate electricity price forecasting is essential to market traders, retailers, and generation companies. To improve prediction accuracy using each model's unique features, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines the wavelet transform, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) based on self-adapting particle swarm optimization and an auto regressive moving average (ARMA). Self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) is adopted to search for the optimal kernel parameters of the KELM.

Thus, how to select an optimization model to improve the forecasting accuracy of electricity price is not only an extremely challenging problem but also a concerned problem for different participants in an electricity market due to our society becoming heavily reliant on electricity. Many researchers developed hybrid models through the use of optimization methods, classical statistical models, artificial intelligence approaches and de-noising methods.

Because of nonlinearity, nonstationary, and volatility of electricity price, it is highly essential to forecast the price on a short-term scale. This paper presents an efficient method based on a hybrid functional link dynamic neural network (DNN) trained by an adaptive robust unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The proposed method forecasts hourly prices for the day-ahead electricity market. The functional block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher-dimensional space through a basis function without using any hidden layer like multilayer perceptron structure. The DNN includes one or more infinite impulse response filters in the forward path providing feedback connections between outputs and inputs. This allows signal flow in both forward and backward directions, giving the network a dynamic memory useful to mimic dynamic systems. Also to improve the accuracy of the forecast, the noise covariance matrices of the UKF are adapted recursively. The proposed method is tested on PJM electricity market, and the residuals mean absolute error is compared with other forecasting methods, indicating the improved accuracy of the approach and its suitability to produce a real-time forecast.

Responsiveness of the market participants can improve reliability of system operation as well as capital cost investments. In this regard, the accurate forecast of electricity price and demand in smart grids is an important challenge as their strong correlation makes a separate forecasting to be ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneous forecast of price and demand that uses a set of effective tools in preprocessing part, forecast engine and tuned algorithm. To highlight our contributions, the proposed forecast algorithm classified into three main parts. The first part employs a new Flexible Wavelet Packet Transform (FWPT) to decompose a signal into multiple terms at different frequencies, and a new feature selection method that employs Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) and adjacent features in order to select valuable input data. The second part consists of a novel Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model based on Nonlinear Least Square Support Vector Machine (NLSSVM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in order to model the linear and nonlinear correlation between price and load in two stages. The final part employs a modified version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm based on time-varying coefficients and stumble generation operator, called TV-SABC, in order to optimize NLSSVM parameters in a learning process. The proposed hybrid forecasting algorithm is evaluated on several real and well-known markets illustrating its high accuracy in simultaneous forecast of electricity price and demand.

"Li P., Arci F., Reilly J., Curran K., Belatreche A.",Using artificial neural networks to predict short-term wholesale prices on the Irish Single Electricity Market,2016,2,"Electricity markets are different from other markets as electricity generation cannot be easily stored in large amounts and in order to avoid blackouts, the generation of electricity must be balanced with customer demand for it on a second-by-second basis. Customers tend to rely on electricity for day-to-day living and cannot replace it easily so when electricity prices increase, customer demand generally does not reduce significantly in the short-term. As electricity generation and customer demand must be matched perfectly second-by-second, and because generation cannot be stored to a large extent, cost bids from generators must be balanced with demand estimates in advance of real-time. This paper outlines a a forecasting algorithm built on artificial neural networks in order to predict short-term (72 hours ahead) wholesale prices on the Irish Single Electricity Market so that market participants can make more informed trading decisions. Research studies have demonstrated that an adaptive or self-adaptive approach to forecasting would appear more suited to the task of predicting energy demands in territory such as Ireland.

Specifically, the models refer to the sole application of ANNs or to hybrid models, where the ANN is combined with clustering algorithm. The training data are clustered in homogenous groups and for each cluster, a dedicated forecaster is employed. The proposed models are characterized by comprehensive operation and by high level of flexibility; different inputs can be taken under consideration and different ANN topologies can be examined. The models are tested on a data set that consists of atypical price patterns and many outliers.

"Ortiz M., Ukar O., Azevedo F., Múgica A.",Price forecasting and validation in the Spanish electricity market using forecasts as input data,2016,15,"The electricity sector has been subjected to major changes in the last few years. Previously, there existed a regulated system where electric companies could know beforehand the amount of energy each generator would produce, hence basing their largely operational strategy on cost minimization in order to increase their profits. In Spain, from 1988 till 1997, electricity prices were established by the 'Marco Legal Estable' - Stable Legal Framework -, where the Ministry of Industry and Energy acknowledged the existence of certain generation costs related to each type of technology. It was an industrial sector with no actual competition and therefore, with very few controllable risks. In the aftermath of the electricity market liberalization competition and uncertainty arose. Electricity spot prices became highly volatile due to the specific characteristics of electricity as a commodity. Long-term contracts allowed for hedge funds to act against price fluctuation in the electricity market. As a consequence, developing an accurate electricity price forecasting model is an extremely difficult task for electricity market agents. This work aims to propose a methodology to improve the limitations of those methodologies just using historical data to forecast electricity prices. In this manner, and in order to gain access to more recent data, instead of using natural gas prices and electricity load historical data, a regression model to forecast the evolution of natural gas prices, and a model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to forecast electricity loads, are proposed. The results of these models are used as input for an electricity price forecast model. Finally, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, several study cases applied to the Spanish market, using real price data, are presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Artificial neural network; Electricity markets; Price forecast; Regression model; Volatility,Commerce; Competition; Costs; Electric industry; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Natural gas; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity spot price; Long-term contracts; Operational strategies; Price forecasts; Regression model; Spanish electricity markets; Volatility; Power markets,5,3,1,1,Article,1,a
"Feijoo F., Silva W., Das T.K.",A computationally efficient electricity price forecasting model for real time energy markets,2016,12,"Increased significance of demand response and proliferation of distributed energy resources will continue to demand faster and more accurate models for forecasting locational marginal prices. This paper presents such a model (named K-SVR). While yielding prediction accuracy comparable with the best known models in the literature, K-SVR requires a significantly reduced computational time. The computational reduction is attained by eliminating the use of a feature selection process, which is commonly used by the existing models in the literature. K-SVR is a hybrid model that combines clustering algorithms, support vector machine, and support vector regression. K-SVR is tested using Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland market data from the periods 2005-6, 2011-12, and 2014-15. Market data from 2006 has been used to measure performance of many of the existing models. Authors chose these models to compare performance and demonstrate strengths of K-SVR. Results obtained from K-SVR using the market data from 2012 and 2015 are new, and will serve as benchmark for future models. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Electricity price forecasting; Real time electricity markets; Support vector machine; Support vector regression,Clustering algorithms; Commerce; Costs; Energy resources; Forecasting; Industrial economics; Support vector machines; Vectors; Computational reduction; Computationally efficient; Distributed Energy Resources; Electricity price forecasting; Locational marginal prices; Prediction accuracy; Real time; Support vector regression (SVR); Power markets,5,1,2,1,Article,4,

"Bisoi R., Dharmapandit O., Dash S.K.",A Functional link single layer feedforward neural network for electricity price forecasting using improved second order Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm,2016,,"Fuzzy neural networks (FNN) are found to be universal approximators when all the parameters of the network are adjusted simultaneously. Therefore, they have been used extensively for classification and regression problems. Normally FNN uses TSK-type fuzzy rules where the consequent part of the rule base comprises linear terms. Thus FNNs may not be able to effectively handle chaotic time series like stock or electricity price time series by providing an accurate mapping. In this paper, therefore, the consequent part of the time series comprises the output from a functional link network that provides an expanded input dimension to handle the uncertainties and chaotic fluctuation of the time series databases. Further to improve the training speed for the weights of the FNN a second order Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is used.

Price forecasting is very important for online trading, e-commerce and power system operation. Forecasting the hourly locational marginal prices (LMP) in the electricity markets is a very important basis for the decision making in order to maximize the profits/benefits. The novel approach proposed in this paper for forecasting the electricity prices uses WLS technique and compares the results with the results obtained by using ANNs. To perform this price forecasting, the market knowledge is utilized to optimize the selection of input data for the electricity price forecasting tool. In this paper, price forecasting for Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection is demonstrated using the ANNs and the proposed WLS technique. The data used for this price forecasting is obtained from the PJM website. The forecasting results obtained by both methods are compared, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting approach. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the accuracy of prediction has increased in both seasons using the proposed WLS technique.

This paper places itself in price directed power systems, where participants respond with their load demand to incoming price signals. To that end, a two hour-ahead forecasting method using a linear composition of kernel machines for electricity prices is introduced. Initially, two kernel machines, i.e., a Gaussian process (GP) and a relevance vector machine (RVM), are utilized for next-two-hour prediction making. Subsequently, a linear predictor composed of the two kernel machines, which are both equipped with the Gaussian kernel, is built that integrates the individual predictions to provide a single one. The linear coefficients are obtained as the solution of multiobjective problem that is sought by a genetic algorithm utilizing Pareto optimality theory. Method testing is performed on a set of historical data obtained from the New England area. The proposed Pareto optimal kernel machine composition outperforms in terms of accuracy the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) predictor as well as the individual kernel machines in the vast majority of the tested cases. © 2015 IEEE.",Electricity price forecasting; GP; Pareto optimality; RVM; smart power systems,Forecasting; Gaussian noise (electronic); Genetic algorithms; Global positioning system; Information science; Pareto principle; Power markets; Autoregressive moving average; Electricity price forecasting; Individual prediction; Multi-objective problem; Pareto-optimality; Relevance Vector Machine; Smart power distribution systems; Very short term forecasting; Costs,5,1,1,1,Conference,4,

Therefore, well-performing forecast methods for day-ahead electricity prices are essential for energy traders and supply companies.In this paper, a methodology based on artificial neuronal networks (ANN) is presented to forecast electricity prices. As the performance of an ANN forecast model depends on appropriate input parameter sets, the focus is set on the selection and preparation of fundamental data that has a noticeable impact on electricity prices. This is done with the help of different cluster algorithms, but also by comparing the results of the pre-selected model configurations in combination with different input parameter settings. After the determination of the optimal input parameters, affecting day-ahead electricity prices, and well-performing ANN configuration, the developed ANN model is applied for in-sample and out-of-sample analyses.

Comparisons of errors from different ISMPF models identified the most important variables for forecasting purposes. Similar analyses were applied to determine the best daily session models for price forecasts (DSMPF models) for the day-ahead price forecasting in the daily session of the MIBEL, considering as input variables extensive hourly time series records of recent prices, power demands and power generations in the previous day, forecasts of demand, wind power generation and weather for the day-ahead, and chronological variables. ISMPF models include the input variables of DSMPF models as well as the daily session prices and prices of preceding intraday sessions. The best ISMPF models achieved lower MAPEs for most of the intraday sessions compared to the error of the best DSMPF model; furthermore, such DSMPF error was very close to the lowest limit error for the daily session.

"Aghaebrahimi M.R., Taherian H.",Short-term price forecasting considering distributed generation in the price-sensitive environment of smart grids,2016,3,"In smart grids environment, all participants, including different load types, are able to utilize the network. Advances in measurement tools in these networks make it easy to move towards dynamic pricing and non-fixed electricity tariffs. In this environment, the forecasted electricity price is declared to wholesale and retail consumers via Advanced Measurement Instruments (AMI). Therefore, motivated by different factors such as optimizing the economic/environmental issues or increasing the reliability, the customers are able to react to prices and manage their consumption. This pattern of reaction brings about extensive changes in the load and price curves of the network. On the other hand, environmental concerns resulting from the use of fossil fuels have increased the exploitation of renewable energies. But, as the penetration of renewable energy sources increases, serious improvements and modifications for the existing electric grid are needed to accommodate and integrate these intermittent sources. In this paper, a hybrid model is presented for simultaneous short term forecasting of electricity prices considering Distributed Generation (DG) in the price-sensitive environment of smart grids. The proposed model combines the Support Vector Regression (SVR) network with an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) network, and it is capable of tracking customers' reaction to declared prices.

"Wang K., Xu C., Guo S.",Big data analytics for price forecasting in smart grids,2016,10,"Demand side management (DSM) is a key mechanism to make smart grids cost efficient using electricity price forecasting issue. Price forecasting method takes the big price data into account, and gives estimates of the future electricity price. However, most of existing price forecasting methods cannot avoid redundancy at feature selection and lack of an integrated framework that coordinates the steps in forecasting. To address this issue, we first propose a new electricity price forecasting framework. It is significant to design a system tool chain based on big data analytics for ensuring that the users can make appropriate decisions. To this end, three algorithms are proposed integratedly. First, feature redundancy elimination is implemented by the fusion of Grey Correlation Analysis (GCA) and ReliefF algorithm. Second, a combination of Kernel function and Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) is designed to achieve dimensionality reduction. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization algorithm based on differential evolution (DE) is proposed to forecast price classification. These three modules jointly power the price forecasting system.

"Mori H., Nakano K.",An Efficient Hybrid Intelligent Method for Electricity Price Forecasting,2016,1,"In this paper an efficient method is proposed for electricity price forecasting. This paper focuses on Locational Marginal Price (LMP) that efficiently maintains power markets by alleviating transmission network congestion. There are complicated behaviors of the time series due to uncertain factors in the power markets. From a standpoint of market players, a sophisticated method is required to forecast LMP effectively. The proposed method makes use of the hybridization of GP (Gaussian Process) of hierarchical Bayesian estimation, EPSO (Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization) of evolutionary computation and fuzzy c-means of allowing data to belong to two or more clusters. EPSO is used to improve the accuracy of parameters in MAP (Maximum a Posteriori) estimation for GP.

Thus, in the electricity markets, accurate electricity price forecasting plays significant role for power producers and consumers. Although many studies developing and proposing highly accurate forecasting models exist in the literature, there have been few investigations on improving the forecasting effectiveness of electricity price from the perspective of reducing the volatility of data with satisfactory accuracy. Based on reducing the volatility of the electricity price and the forecasting nature of the radial basis function network (RBFN), this paper successfully develops a two-stage model to forecast the day-ahead electricity price, of which the first stage is particle swarm optimization (PSO)-core mapping (CM) with self-organizing-map and fuzzy set (PCMwSF), and the second stage is selection rule (SR). The PCMwSF stage applies CM, fuzzy set and optimized weights to obtain the future price, and the SR stage is inspired by the forecasting nature of RBFN and effectively selects the best forecast during the test period.

"Mori H., Nakano K.",EPSO-based Gaussian process for electricity price forecasting,2015,1,"In this paper, a new method is proposed for Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) forecasting in Smart Grid. The marginal cost is required to supply electric power to incremental loads in case where a certain node increases power demands in a balanced power system. LMP plays an important role to maintain economic efficiency in electric power markets in a way that electricity flows from a low-cost area to high-cost ones and the transmission network congestion is alleviated. The power market players are interested in maximizing the profits and minimizing the risks through selling and buying electricity. As a result, it is of importance to obtain accurate information on electricity pricing forecasting in advance so that their aim is achieved. This paper presents the Gaussian Process (GP) technique that comes from the extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in which hierarchical Bayesian estimation is introduced to express the model parameters as the probabilistic variables. The advantage is that the model accuracy of GP is better than others. GP is integrated with k-means of clustering to improve the performance of GP. Also, this paper makes use of the Mahalanobis kernel in GP rather than the Gaussian one so that GP is generalized to approximate nonlinear systems. EPSO of evolutionary computation is applied to GP to determine the parameters of the kernel function.

However, the time series of electricity price has nonlinear, non-stationary and volatile behaviour and so its forecast method should have high learning capability to extract the complex input/output mapping function of electricity price. In this paper, a Combinatorial Neural Network (CNN) based forecasting engine is proposed to predict the future values of price data. The CNN-based forecasting engine is equipped with a new training mechanism for optimizing the weights of the CNN. This training mechanism is based on an efficient stochastic search method, which is a modified version of chemical reaction optimization algorithm, giving high learning ability to the CNN. The proposed price forecast strategy is tested on the real-world electricity markets of Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) and mainland Spain and its obtained results are extensively compared with the results obtained from several other forecast methods. These comparisons illustrate effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Kim M.-K.,A new approach to short-term price forecast strategy with an artificial neural network approach: Application to the Nord Pool,2015,6,"In new deregulated electricity market, short-term price forecasting is key information for all market players. A better forecast of market-clearing price (MCP) helps market participants to strategically set up their bidding strategies for energy markets in the short-term. This paper presents a new prediction strategy to improve the need for more accurate short-term price forecasting tool at spot market using an artificial neural networks (ANNs). To build the forecasting ANN model, a threelayered feedforward neural network trained by the improved Levenberg-marquardt (LM) algorithm is used to forecast the locational marginal prices (LMPs). To accurately predict LMPs, actual power generation and load are considered as the input sets, and then the difference is used to predict price differences in the spot market. The proposed ANN model generalizes the relationship between the LMP in each area and the unconstrained MCP during the same period of time. The LMP calculation is iterated so that the capacity between the areas is maximized and the mechanism itself helps to relieve grid congestion. The addition of flow between the areas gives the LMPs a new equilibrium point, which is balanced when taking the transfer capacity into account, LMP forecasting is then possible.

In fact, in this environment, the electricity price and load consumption are highly corrected such that the market participants will have complex model in their decisions to maximize their profit. Although the available forecasting mythologies perform well in electricity market by way of little or no load and price interdependencies, but cannot capture load and price dynamics if they exist. To overcome this shortage, a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) model is presented which can consider the correlation between electricity price and load.

This study presents a hybrid price forecasting framework based on a new data fusion algorithm. Owing to the complexity and distinct nature of the electricity price, a single forecast engine cannot capture all different patterns of the price signals. Hence, this study focuses on a hybrid forecasting method to extract the advantages of several forecasting engines. In the proposed method, artificial neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and autoregressive moving average are employed as primary forecast engines (agents) which provide three independent price forecasts. Then, a new data fusion algorithm, the modified ordered weighted average (modified OWA), is proposed to combine the three forecasts to generate a single unified price forecast.

"Mori H., Nakano K.",Application of Gaussian process to locational marginal pricing forecasting,2014,3,"In this paper, a new method is proposed for Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) forecasting in Smart Grid.

"Mei J., He D., Harley R., Habetler T., Qu G.",A random forest method for real-time price forecasting in New York electricity market,2014,13,"This paper mainly focuses on the real-time price forecasting in New York electricity market through random forest. Accurate forecasting is regarded as the most practical way to win power bid in today's highly competitive electricity market. Comparing with existing price forecasting methods, random forest, as a newly introduced method, will provide a price probability distribution, which will allow the users to estimate the risks of their bidding strategy and also making the results helpful for later industrial using. Furthermore, the model can adjust to the latest forecasting condition, i.e. The latest climatic, seasonal and market condition, by updating the random forest parameters with new observations. This adaptability avoids the model failure in a climatic or economic condition different from the training set.

"Wang Z., Liu F., Wu J., Wang J.",A hybrid forecasting model based on bivariate division and a backpropagation artificial neural network optimized by chaos particle swarm optimization for day-ahead electricity price,2014,11,"In the electricity market, the electricity price plays an inevitable role. Nevertheless, accurate price forecasting, a vital factor affecting both government regulatory agencies and public power companies, remains a huge challenge and a critical problem. Determining how to address the accurate forecasting problem becomes an even more significant task in an era in which electricity is increasingly important. Based on the chaos particle swarm optimization (CPSO), the backpropagation artificial neural network (BPANN), and the idea of bivariate division, this paper proposes a bivariate division BPANN (BD-BPANN) method and the CPSO-BD-BPANN method for forecasting electricity price. The former method creatively transforms the electricity demand and price to be a new variable, named DV, which is calculated using the division principle, to forecast the day-ahead electricity by multiplying the forecasted values of the DVs and forecasted values of the demand. Next, to improve the accuracy of BD-BPANN, chaos particle swarm optimization and BD-BPANN are synthesized to form a novel model, CPSO-BD-BPANN. In this study, CPSO is utilized to optimize the initial parameters of BD-BPANN to make its output more stable than the original model. Finally, two forecasting strategies are proposed regarding different situations. © 2014 Zhilong Wang et al.",,,5,1,1,1,Article,1,a
"Wu L., Shahidehpour M.",A hybrid model for integrated day-ahead electricity price and load forecasting in smart grid,2014,37,"Load and price forecasting are two key issues for market participants and system operators in electricity markets. Most existing works predict load and price separately. However, a dynamic pricing type scenario is envisioned in smart grid, where consumers may have the ability to react to constantly changing price signals by shifting electricity usages from expensive hours to others, which would consequently impact electricity prices. Thus, price and load signals are strongly coupled, and previous separated forecast models may not be as effective. In this study, a two-stage integrated price and load forecasting framework is developed. The first stage provides initial price and load forecasts separately, and the second stage considers load and price interaction with initial forecasts as inputs. At each stage, a hybrid time-series and adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) model is used, in which multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average catches the linear relationship of price and load log return series, generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic unveils heteroscedastic character of residuals and AWNN presents non-linear impacts. Several criteria such as average mean absolute percentage error and error variance are used to measure the forecasting accuracy.

Therefore, electricity price is a key element in optimum demand side management (DSM) in this environment. Accurate short-term forecasting of electricity price is of great importance for the market participants. However, due to the nonlinear, stochastic and time-variant nature of electricity price, accurate forecasting is extremely difficult. On the other hand, distributed generation resources, especially the wind, have widely penetrated these networks and the real time balancing of the demand and generation of power systems has become extremely complicated due to the variable nature of wind generation. In this paper, considering high penetration levels of wind generation, the short-term forecasting of electricity price is investigated based on the Nord Pool power market data.

Elattar E.E.,Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets based on local informative vector machine,2013,20,"In a competitive electricity market, short-term electricity price forecasting are very important for market participants. Electricity price is a very complex signal as a result of its non-linearity, non-stationarity and time-variant behaviour. This study presents a new approach to short-term electricity price forecasting. The proposed method is derived by integrating the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method with the local informative vector machine (IVM), which can be derived by combining the IVM with the local regression method. IVM is a practical probabilistic alternative to the popular support vector machine. Local prediction makes use of similar historical data patterns in the reconstructed space to train the regression algorithm. In the proposed method, KPCA is used to extract features of the inputs and obtain kernel principal components for constructing the phase space of the time series of the inputs. Then local IVM is employed to solve the price forecasting problem. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world dataset.

"Menniti D., Scordino N., Sorrentino N.",A novel approach to forecast day-ahead electricity prices by means of neural networks using groups of similar hours,2012,1,"Forecasting short-term electricity market prices has been the focus of several studies in recent years. Although various approaches have been examined, achieving sufficiently low forecasting errors has not always been possible. However, certain applications, such as demandside management, do not require exact values for future prices, but utilize average values as the basis for making short-term scheduling decisions. With the aim of enhancing the accuracy of the day-ahead electricity price forecasting, field records of the Italian electricity market have been correlated so as to identify a number of blocks of hours, characterized by similarity of price. This paper thus proposes an approach to forecast the day-ahead electricity prices by means of a number of Neural Networks (NNs), with such a number being equal to the number of groups of hours with similarity of price, and with each NN forecasting the mean price over the hours belonging to the related group, as previously determined. Simulation results show that the fundamental and novel contribution of identifying, firstly, the membership of an hour to a particular group of hours, clustered according to their similarity of price, and then forecasting day-ahead prices for the resulting number of groups of hours performs fairly well if compared with other forecasting techniques, either on an hourly or on an average basis, in terms of mean absolute and absolute percentage errors, as well as of variance. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.",Back propagation; Electricity market prices; Forecasting; Neural network; Time series,,5,1,1,1,Article,1,a

"Mohapatra A., Mallick M.K., Panigrahi B.K., Cui Z., Hong S.",A hybrid approach for short term electricity price and load forecasting,2011,3,"In a deregulated power industry, accurate short term load forecasting (STLF) and price forecasting (STPF) is a key issue in daily power market. The load forecasting helps in unit commitment as well as in economic scheduling of the generators. The price forecasting helps an electric utility to make important decisions like generation of electric power, bidding for generation, price switching and infrastructure development. Price forecasting is very much useful for energy suppliers, ISOs and other participants in electric generation, transmission and distribution. This paper presents a hybrid approach for the STLF and STPF. The time series data pertaining to load / price is decomposed into various decomposition levels by the use of Wavelet Transform (WT) and each level obtained by this process is predicted using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

The methods come from time series analysis and artificial intelligence disciplines, and include univariate, multivariate, linear and nonlinear. Within the univariate methods, the double seasonal ARIMA and the recently proposed exponential smoothing for double seasonality are compared and used as benchmarks. They allow us to quantify the improvement on price forecasting when including explanatory variables or using more complex models. Dynamic regression models including the electricity load forecast are then considered. Their good performance in price forecasting has been pointed out by many authors. However, we find evidences of their predictive accuracy can be significantly outperformed by accounting the wind generation forecast provided by the System Operator. Moreover, these forecasts can be even more accurate if changes of price's behavior according with the day of the week are taken into account by means of periodic models. The last of the tested methods are feed-forward neural networks used as multivariate nonlinear regression methods with universal function approximation capabilities.

However, price series usually have a complex behavior due to their nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and time variancy. In this paper, a novel hybrid method to forecast day-ahead electricity price is proposed. This hybrid method is based on wavelet transform, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFN). The wavelet transform provides a set of better-behaved constitutive series than price series for prediction. ARIMA model is used to generate a linear forecast, and then RBFN is developed as a tool for nonlinear pattern recognition to correct the estimation error in wavelet-ARIMA forecast. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the network structure which makes the RBFN be adapted to the specified training set, reducing computation complexity and avoiding overfitting. The proposed method is examined on the electricity market of mainland Spain and the results are compared with some of the most recent price forecast methods.

Deregulation in the power system industry has caused rising requirement in planning, operating and controlling electric energy systems, which brings electricity load forecasting to a crucial level. Therefore, adequate techniques are desired for accurately predicting the load and hence assisting power companies in generating capacity scheduling, maintenance, energy planning and procurement, etc. An accurate forecast can greatly help power distribution companies to improve their electricity marketing strategies and avoid over or under unitisation of generating capacity and therefore optimises energy prices. But, to predict the load demand in real time requires a considerable amount of efforts.

One of the most important ones is forecasting the market clearing price (MCP) of electricity. Decisions on various issues, such as to buy or sell electricity and to offer a transaction to the market, require accurate knowledge of the MCP. Another problem, which has also been an important issue of the traditional power systems, is load forecasting for both short and long terms. In this paper, a new forecasting method is introduced to predict the next day electricity price and load. The proposed method is based on cooperative co-evolutionary (Co-Co) approach and has been applied to the real power market. Most of the conventional forecasting methods are based on a single neural network prediction. These methods might misrepresent parts of the input-output data mapping that could have been correctly represented by cooperation of multiple networks.

"Niu D., Liu D., Wu D.D.",A soft computing system for day-ahead electricity price forecasting,2010,47,"Hourly energy prices in a competitive electricity market are volatile. Forecast of energy price is key information to help producers and purchasers involved in electricity market to prepare their corresponding bidding strategies so as to maximize their profits. It is difficult to forecast all the hourly prices with only one model for different behaviors of different hourly prices. Neither will it get excellent results with 24 different models to forecast the 24 hourly prices respectively, for there are always not sufficient data to train the models, especially the peak price in summer. This paper proposes a novel technique to forecast day-ahead electricity prices based on Self-Organizing Map neural network (SOM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. SOM is used to cluster the data automatically according to their similarity to resolve the problem of insufficient training data. SVM models for regression are built on the categories clustered by SOM separately. Parameters of the SVM models are chosen by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automatically to avoid the arbitrary parameters decision of the tester, improving the forecasting accuracy. The comparison suggests that SOM-SVM-PSO has considerable value in forecasting day-ahead price in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market, especially for summer peak prices. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Amjady N., Daraeepour A., Keynia F.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting by modified relief algorithm and hybrid neural network,2010,118,"In a power market, the price of electricity is the most important signal to all market participants. However, electricity price forecast is a complex task due to non-linearity, non-stationarity and volatility of the price signal.

Besides, there is a lack of robust feature selection technique for designing the input vector of electricity price forecast, which can consider the non-linearities of the price signal.

"Mandal P., Srivastava A.K., Senjyu T., Negnevitsky M.",A new recursive neural network algorithm to forecast electricity price for PJM day-ahead market,2010,14,"This paper evaluates the usefulness of publicly available electricity market information in predicting the hourly prices in the PJM day-ahead electricity market using recursive neural network (RNN) technique, which is based on similar days (SD) approach. RNN is a multi-step approach based on one output node, which uses the previous prediction as input for the subsequent forecasts. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed RNN model is done with respect to SD method and other literatures. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed RNN approach in forecasting short-term electricity prices, different criteria are used. Mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of reasonably small values were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. Error variance, one of the important performance criteria, is also calculated in order to measure robustness of the proposed RNN model. The numerical results obtained through the simulation to forecast next 24 and 72 h electricity prices show that the forecasts generated by the proposed RNN model are significantly accurate and efficient, which confirm that the proposed algorithm performs well for shortterm price forecasting.

"Vahidinasab V., Jadid S.",Bayesian neural network model to predict day-ahead electricity prices,2010,15,"Market participants in the new competitive electricity markets find price forecasting so valuable in developing their bidding strategies. In this paper, the Bayesian neural network (BNN) approach is proposed for day-ahead prediction of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the pool based energy markets, in which to select the optimum inputs of the BNN, the correlation coefficient technique is used. LMP has a volatile and time dependent behavior. Hence, prediction of such a complex signal is a challenging task requiring a qualified forecasting tool, which not only fits well to the training data, but also can predict the stochastic behavior of unseen part of the signal. The proposed Bayesian approach to predict day-ahead electricity prices presents noteworthy advantages over the classical neural networks (NN) methods which include the avoidance of network overfitting, an indication of the degree of uncertainty in the predictions, automatic selection of an appropriate scale for network weights and, accordingly, selection of the optimal forecasting model. Examining the proposed forecast strategy on the different periods of the Pennsylvania- New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can provide more accurate results than the other price forecasting techniques, such as, ARIMA time series, wavelet-ARIMA, classical NN, and also a similar day method.

"Filho J.C.R., Affonso C.M., Oliveira R.C.L.",Pricing analysis in the Brazilian energy market: A decision tree approach,2009,10,"There is a general consensus that electricity price forecasting is an important task nowadays since power market players are interested in the maximization of profit and the minimization of risk. In this context, this paper proposes the use of Data-Mining techniques to predict the short-term electricity price in the Brazilian market. In Brazil, the market model adopted has unique characteristics with a centralized form of dispatch due to the predominance of hydro generation. To apply the proposed prediction model, all features of the Brazilian electricity market are considered, such as the transmission restrictions among geo-electrical regions and the price dependency with storage energy in reservoirs. In the proposed prediction model, the electricity price is the dependent variable and the monthly time series data sets from the Brazilian system (such as power load, stored energy and thermal generation) are the independent variables. First, clustering of the data samples is performed to group similar behavior of the attributes. After that, a decision tree algorithm is applied to extract if-then rules from database. The rules obtained allow the identification of attributes that most influence the short-term electricity price. Results show that the proposed model can be an attractive tool to all electricity market players to forecast the short-term electricity price and mitigate the risks in purchasing power. © 2009 IEEE.",Clustering; Data-mining; Decision trees; Short-term electricity price forecasting,Brazilian electricity markets; Brazilian system; Clustering; Clustering data; Data sample; Decision-tree algorithm; Dependent variables; Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Energy markets; Hydro generation; If-then rules; Independent variables; Market model; Power load; Power markets; Prediction model; Purchasing power; Storage energy; Stored energy; Thermal generation; Time-series data; Cluster analysis; Commerce; Costs; Decision trees; Electric load forecasting; Electricity; Mathematical models; Profitability; Time series; Electric generators,5,1,1,1,Conference,7,

"Mandal P., Srivastava A.K., Negnevitsky M.",Improving performance of NN based electricity price forecasting using sensitivity analysis,2009,3,"This paper focuses on sensitivity analysis of neural network (NN) parameters in order to improve the performance of NN based short-term electricity price forecasting. Sensitivity analysis of NN parameters include back-propagation learning set (BP-set), learning rate (η), momentum (α) and NN learning days (dNN). Presented work is an extended version of previous work done by authors to integrate NN and similar days (SD) method for predicting day-ahead electricity prices. Similar days refer to similar price days, i.e., price data obtained from historical days. Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of similar price days. Similar days method adopts the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. The similar days parameters, i.e., time framework of similar days (d = 45 days) and number of selected similar price days (N = 5) are kept constant for all the simulated cases. Forecasting performance is carried out by choosing a day from each season of the year 2006 randomly, and for which, the NN parameters for the base case are considered as BP-set = 500, η = 0.8, α = 0.1 and dNN = 45 days. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the value of BP-set (500, 1000, 1500); η (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2), α (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and dNN (15, 30, 45 and 60 days). During the sensitivity analysis, the most favorable value of BP-set is first identified followed by that of η and α, and based on which the best value of dNN is determined. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the best value of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained when BP-set = 500, η = 0.8, α = 0.1 and dNN = 60 days for winter season, whereas for spring, summer and autumn, these values are 500, 0.6, 0.1 and 45 days, respectively.

"Yamashita D., Mohd Isa A., Yokoyama R., Niimura T.",Forecasting of electricity price and demand using auto-regressive neural networks,2008,0,"This paper proposes a forecasting technique of electricity demand and price with volatility based on neural networks. Recent deregulation and liberalization are worldwide currents in the electric industry. The price competition was introduced in a spot market, and the price volatility is concerned because the demand side is non-elastic, and electricity differs from other general commodities. The authors firstly predict an uncertain electric power demand by using the auto-regressive model of the neural networks. The neural network is a popular feed-forward three-layer model, and the input variables of the neural networks include the historical demand, temperature, weather-related discomfort index, and the day of the week. Secondly, by using the demand forecasted and the past prices, we apply the technique for forecasting the electricity price of the next day. The utility of the proposed technique was verified by using real data of the electric power wholesale spot market.

"Zhang J., Cheng C.",Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using artificial intelligence,2008,9,"Accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DEPF) has significant meanings in deregulated electrical power market due to its profitable function for all the participants to make reasonable decisions during the market business activities. However, the DEPF with satisfactory precision is difficult to be gained because of the violent volatility of electricity price caused by many factors. In this study, a multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks model is constructed for the DEPF in spot market of Nord Pool which is one of the most successful electrical power markets in the world. The major influencing factors are chosen by statistical methods called auto correlation function (ACF) and cross correlation function (CCF), and the standard error back-propagation algorithm is improved by using self-adaptive learning rate and self-adaptive momentum coefficient algorithm to make the training process more efficient both in global optimization and time saving. The most suitable structure of the network is determined by a trial-and-error experiment minimizing MAPE and MSRE of the network and several commonly used error indicators are employed to evaluate the goodness of fit performance of the model. The case study indicates that the DEPF of the proposed model is more reasonable and accurate, comparing with that of traditional ARIMA model. © 2008 IEEE.",ARIMA; Artificial neural networks; Electricity price forecasting; Nord Pool; Self-adaptive algorithm,Adaptive algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Costs; Deregulation; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electricity; Global optimization; Lakes; Learning algorithms; Marketing; Multilayer neural networks; ARIMA; Artificial neural networks; Electricity price forecasting; Nord Pool; Self-adaptive algorithm; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1,Conference,1,a

This will complicate short-term load forecasting and challenge the existing forecasting methods that are applied to a fixed-price environment.

The model first makes use of the nonlinear approaching capacity of the RBF network to forecast the load on the prediction day with no account of the factor of electricity price, and then, based on the recent changes of the real-time price, it uses the ANFIS system to adjust the results of load forecasting obtained by RBF network.

In addition, the bidding strategies of the participants are such that the relationships between price and fundamentals are non-linear and dynamic. The lack of market maturity and high complexity hinders the use of traditional statistical methodologies (e.g., regression analysis) for price forecasting. Therefore, a flexible model is needed to achieve good forecasting in OEM.

"Pino R., Parreno J., Gomez A., Priore P.",Forecasting next-day price of electricity in the Spanish energy market using artificial neural networks,2008,92,"In this paper, next-day hourly forecasts are calculated for the energy price in the electricity production market of Spain. The methodology used to achieve these forecasts is based on artificial neural networks, which have been used successfully in recent years in many forecasting applications. The days to be forecast include working days as well as weekends and holidays, due to the fact that energy price has different behaviours depending on the kind of day to be forecast. Besides, energy price time series are usually composed of too many data, which could be a problem if we are looking for a short period of time to reach an adequate forecast. In this paper, a training method for artificial neural nets is proposed, which is based on making a previous selection for the multilayer perceptron (MLP) training samples, using an ART-type neural network. The MLP is then trained and finally used to calculate forecasts. These forecasts are compared to those obtained from the well-known Box-Jenkins ARIMA forecasting method. Results show that neural nets perform better than ARIMA models, especially for weekends and holidays. Both methodologies calculate more accurate forecasts-in terms of mean absolute percentage error-for working days that for weekends and holidays.

The work presented in this paper is an extended version of our previous works where we proposed the price prediction technique by using ANN, which is based on similar days method. According to similar days method, we select similar price days corresponding to forecast day based on Euclidean norm. The focus of the present paper is mainly on sensitivity analysis of similar days parameter while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the PJM electricity market. We simulated three cases by: (i) selecting two similar days parameters (load at t and price at t); (ii) selecting three similar days parameters (load at t, price at t and price at t - 1), and (iii) selecting five similar days parameters (load at t, load at t - 1, load at t + 1, price at t and price at t - 1). The next-24h price forecasts obtained from ANN based on similar days method confirm that the performance of the ANN model is better when five similar days parameters are selected, i.e., the accuracy of the method is enhanced by the addition of load at t - 1 and t + 1. The factors impacting the electricity price forecasting, including time factors, load factors, and historical price factors are well discussed. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and forecast mean square error (FMSE) of reasonably small values were obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination of (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price. © 2007 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Electricity price forecasting; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Power market; Similar days,Backpropagation; Correlation methods; Error analysis; Forecasting; Neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; ANN modeling; Artificial neural network; Correlation co-efficient; Electricity markets; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity pricing; Euclidean norms; Load factors; Locational marginal prices (LMPs); Mean absolute percentage error; Mean-square errors; Power market; Price factors; Price forecasting; Price prediction; Similar days; Time factors; Electric load forecasting,"4, 5",1,1,1,Conference,1,a

This paper provides a method for predicting hourly prices in the day-ahead electricity market using Recursive Neural Network (RNN) technique, which is based on similar days approach. RNN is a multi-step approach based on one output node, which uses the previous prediction as input for the subsequent forecasts. In this way, it is carried out recursively for twenty four steps to predict next 24 hour prices. Comparison of forecasting performance of the proposed RNN model with similar days along with other literature is presented. The proposed method is examined on the PJM electricity market. The results obtained through the simulation show that the proposed RNN model can provide efficient, accurate and better results. © 2007 IEEE.",Electricity market; Price forecasting; Recursive neural network; Similar days,Electricity; Marketing; Neural networks; Risk assessment; Electricity market; Price forecasting; Similar days; Costs,5,1,1,1,Conference,2,

Georgilakis P.S.,Artificial intelligence solution to electricity price forecasting problem,2007,13,"The market-clearing prices in deregulated electricity markets are volatile. Good market-clearing price forecasting will help producers and consumers to prepare their corresponding bidding strategies so as to maximize their profits. Market-clearing price prediction is a difficult task since bidding strategies used by market participants are complicated and various uncertainties interact in an intricate way. This article proposes the use of two artificial neural networks: the first to predict the day-ahead load and the second to forecast the day-ahead market-clearing prices. The methodology is applied to the California power market. After determining the optimal artificial neural network architecture with the minimum mean absolute percentage error on the test set, this architecture is used for price forecasting in periods with price spikes, for price forecasting for weekends, and for week-ahead MCP forecasting during the four seasons of the year. The forecasting accuracy of the artificial neural network model is compared with the accuracy of the persistence method and the results prove the efficiency and practicality of the proposed technique.",,Costs; Electric utilities; Error analysis; Industrial economics; Mathematical models; Uncertainty analysis; Bidding strategies; Electricity prices; Neural networks,5,1,1,1,Article,1,a

Market participants rely on price forecasts to decide their bidding strategies, allocate assets, negotiate bilateral contracts, hedge risks, and plan facility investments. Market operators can also use electricity price forecasts to predict market power indexes for the purpose of monitoring participants' behaviors. Various forecasting techniques are applied to different time horizons for electricity price forecasting in locational marginal pricing (LMP) spot markets. Available correlated data also have to be selected to improve the short-term forecasting performance.

"Karsaz A., Khaloozadeh H.",Medium term horizon market clearing price and load forecasting with an improved dual unscented Kalman filter,2007,3,"The deregulation of electric power supply industries has raised many challenging problems. One of the most important ones is forecasting the Market Clearing Price (MCP) of electricity. Decisions on various issues, such as to buy or sell electricity and to offer a transaction to the market, require accurate knowledge of the MCP. Another problem, which has also been an important issue of the traditional power systems, is load forecasting for both short and long terms. The extended kalman filter has been widely adopted for state estimation of nonlinear systems, machine learning applications and neural network training. In the EKF, the state distribution is approximated by the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. Therefore this can introduce large errors in the load and price forecasting as two Chaotic, nonstationary and nonlinear time-series. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF), in contrast, achieves third-order accuracy, by using a minimal set of MCP and load sigma points. In this paper an improved dual unscented Kalman filter (DUKF), which estimate state and parameter simultaneously has been applied to the real New England power market. The numerical stability and more accurate predictions of our method is comparable to the EKF, and traditional neural network training methods. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the DUKF is the same order as that of the EKE. The obtained results show significant improvement in both price and load forecasting. © 2007 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; Deregulation; Electric power market; Load forecasting; Price prediction; Unscented filtering,Cost accounting; Deregulation; Electric power distribution; Marketing; Electric power market; Load forecasting; Price prediction; Neural networks,5,2,1,1,Conference,1,a

Virtually all of these methods are based on using statistical patterns, which are perceived between the yearly load and system marginal price (SMP) histories of the system to predict the forecasted year's power demand and SMP. The SMP forecasting is a very important element in an electricity market for the optimal biddings of market participants as well as for market stabilization of regulatory bodies. The proposed method introduces a system type neural network architecture to perform electricity price forecasting. Specifically, the proposed approach begins with the premise that the electricity price for a given year can be given a structure which can then be related to the structure of the reference year, in such a way that a transformation can be found from the reference year's structure to the forecasting year's structure. The transformation depends upon how parameters, which influenced the SMP but can not be measured, move from the reference year to the forecasting year. © 2006 IEEE.",,Electricity market; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Market participants; Optimal bidding; Power demands; Regulatory bodies; Statistical pattern; System marginal price; Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Forecasting; Network architecture; Neural networks; Power transmission; Electric load forecasting,5,1,1,1,Conference,1,c

"Benaouda D., Murtagh F.",Hybrid wavelet model for electricity pool-price forecasting in a deregulated electricity market,2006,6,"Electricity supply industry is in the process of deregulation in many countries including Australia. The purpose of deregulation is to give consumers free choices of their electricity supply. Thus, accurate electricity pool price forecasting can provide a set of vital predicted information that helps generation, transmission and retailer participating companies to bid strategically into a deregulated electricity market in order to maximize their profits. In this article, we propose a wavelet multiscale decomposition based autoregressive approach for the prediction of one-hour ahead and one-day ahead pool price based on historical electricity pool price and predicted electricity load data. This approach is based on a multiple resolution decomposition of the signal using the non-decimated or redundant Haar à trous wavelet transform whose advantage is taking into account the asymmetric nature of the time-varying data. There is an additional computational advantage in that there is no need to re-compute the wavelet transform (wavelet coefficients) of the full signal if the electricity pool price data (time series) is regularly updated. We assess results produced by this multiscale autoregressive (MAR) method, in both linear and non-linear variants, with single resolution autoregressive (AR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) model.

An approach to predict the market behaviors is to use the historical prices, loads and other required information to forecast the future prices and loads. This paper introduces an approach for several hour ahead (1-6 h) electricity price and load forecasting using an artificial intelligence method, such as a neural network model, which uses publicly available data from the NEMMCO web site to forecast electricity prices and loads for the Victorian electricity market. An approach of selection of similar days is proposed according to which the load and price curves are forecasted by using the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. A Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of the similar days. Two different ANN models, one for one to six hour ahead load forecasting and another for one to six hour ahead price forecasting have been proposed. The MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) results show a clear increasing trend with the increase in hour ahead load and price forecasting. The sample average of MAPEs for one hour ahead price forecasts is 9.75%. This figure increases to only 20.03% for six hour ahead predictions. Similarly, the one to six hour ahead load forecast errors (MAPE) range from 0.56% to 1.30% only.

Deregulation of the electric power industry worldwide raises many challenging issues. Under this environment there will be new tasks to be solved. In the traditional and also new structure of the power industry, accurate short and long term load forecasting have been crucial to the efficient and economic operation of the system. However in the environment of a deregulated power market, various decisions require accurate knowledge of future spot prices for electricity.

"Zhang L., Luh P.B.",Neural network-based market clearing price prediction and confidence interval estimation with an improved extended Kalman filter method,2005,152,"Market clearing prices (MCPs) play an important role in a deregulated power market, and good MCP prediction and confidence interval (CD estimation will help utilities and independent power producers submit effective bids with low risks. MCP prediction, however, is difficult, since MCP is a nonstationary process. Effective prediction, in principle, can be achieved by neural networks using extended Kalman filter (EKF) as an integrated adaptive learning and CI estimation method. EKF learning, however, is computationally expensive because it involves high dimensional matrix manipulations. This paper presents a modified U-D factorization method within the decoupled EKF (DEKF) framework. The computational speed and numerical stability of this resulting DEKF-UD method are significantly improved as compared to standard EKF. Testing results for a classroom problem and New England MCP predictions show that this new method provides smaller CIs than what provided by the BP-Bayesian method developed by the authors. Testing also shows that our new method has faster convergence, provides more accurate predictions as compared to BP-Bayesian, and our DEKF-UD MCP predictions are comparable in quality to ISO New England's predictions. © 2005 IEEE.",Confidence interval; Deregulated power market; Extended Kalman filter; Market clearing price; Neural networks; Prediction,Costs; Deregulation; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Kalman filtering; Learning algorithms; Marketing; Matrix algebra; Neural networks; Statistical methods; Confidence interval; Deregulated power market; Extended Kalman filter; Market clearing price; Electric power systems,5,1,1,2,Article,1,a

The SMP forecasting is a very important element in an electricity market for the optimal biddings of market participants as well as for market stabilization of regulatory bodies. Input data are organized in two different approaches, time-axis and day-axis approaches, and the resulting patterns are used to train the ANN. Performances of the two approaches are compared and the better estimate is selected by a composition rule to forecast the SMP. By combining the two approaches, the proposed composition technique reflects the characteristics of hourly, daily and seasonal variations, as well as the condition of sudden changes in the spot market, and thus improves the accuracy of forecasting.

Good LMP forecasting will help market participants make effective decisions when preparing offers and bids and making bilateral contracts. LMP forecasting, however, is difficult since LMPs are closely affected by complicated market behaviors and depend heavily on transmission congestions. This paper presents a neural network-based method for forecasting zonal LMPs by using the Decoupled Extend Kalman Filter (DEKF) with UD factorization and sequential updating. Congestion components are emphasized by forecasting differences between zonal LMPs and hub LMPs, and the hub LMPs themselves are forecasted by their logarithm to better reflect market behaviors. A method is also developed to capture system transmission outages. To overcome the unavailability of zonal loads, a method is developed to predict zonal loads based on the total load. Two neural networks are developed to forecast real-time LMPs before and after the day-ahead market is cleared. Testing results with data from the PJM and New England markets show that the method is computationally efficient and provides accurate LMP predictions and confidence intervals.

A major challenge for using a committee machine is to properly combine predictions from multiple networks, since the performance of individual networks is input dependent due to mapping misrepresentation. This paper presents a new method in which weighting coefficients for combining network predictions are the probabilities that individual networks capture the true input-output relationship at that prediction instant.

"Ni E., Luh P.B.",Forecasting power market clearing price and its discrete PDF using a Bayesian-based classification method,2001,49,"Neural network methods have been successfully used for various applications. In time series prediction problems, the regression models such as multiple layer perceptron (MLP) and the radial basis function network (RBF) are usually applied. However, they cannot predict the probability density function (PDF) that is critical for some applications. When there is noise or corrupt data in the process, these regression models could be misled, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. In this paper, a classification method combined with a simple regression model is presented to predict the discrete PDF of power market clearing prices, which is critical for many decision-makings such as optimizing bidding strategies, and is very difficult to predict because of high market uncertainties. Our basic idea is to form a number of classes by discretizing the variable to be predicted, and thus converts the time series prediction problem into a pattern classification problem. The classes are clustered based on historical data, and the input statistics (e.g., input mean and covariance matrix, etc.) corresponding to each class are obtained via clustering. Given a new input, these classes are sorted according to the posterior probabilities calculated by using the Bayes’ formula. The prediction is then generated by using an auto-regression method (AR) for the classes with high posterior probabilities. The classes are then updated after the actual output is available. The method developed can be seen as an RBF with variable structure. The posterior probabilities can be viewed as an approximation of the discrete PDF, providing valuable information for decision-makes and for what if analysis. The developed method has been used to predict the on-peak and off-peak average MCPs in the New England market. The testing results show that it outperforms the RBF network in terms of prediction accuracy and computational time.",Auto-regression; Bayes’ rule; Classification; Deregulated electric power markets; MCP prediction,Decision support systems; Electric power systems; Marketing; Multilayer neural networks; Probability density function; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Uncertain systems; Bayesian classification method; Power market clearing price; Regression model; Electric load forecasting,"4, 5",1,1,1,Article,7,

"Wang A., Ramsay B.",Prediction of system marginal price in the UK Power Pool using neural networks,1997,39,There is an increasing interest in the prediction of system marginal price (SMP) in the Power Pool since electricity industry vesting in England and Wales in 1990. The prediction of SMP improves the financial performance of an independent power producer bidding in the day-ahead market. This paper presents a successful application of using neural networks to predict SMP at each settlement period on the next scheduling day in the UK Pool. The approach does not require any individual Pool participant commercially sensitive information; the historical public SMP and other data are used to train the neural network.

"Catalão J.P.S., Mariano S.J.P.S., Mendes V.M.F., Ferreira L.A.F.M.",Short-term electricity prices forecasting in a competitive market: A neural network approach,2007,301.0,"This paper proposes a neural network approach for forecasting short-term electricity prices. Almost until the end of last century, electricity supply was considered a public service and any price forecasting which was undertaken tended to be over the longer term, concerning future fuel prices and technical improvements. Nowadays, short-term forecasts have become increasingly important since the rise of the competitive electricity markets. In this new competitive framework, short-term price forecasting is required by producers and consumers to derive their bidding strategies to the electricity market. Accurate forecasting tools are essential for producers to maximize their profits, avowing profit losses over the misjudgement of future price movements, and for consumers to maximize their utilities. A three-layered feedforward neural network, trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, is used for forecasting next-week electricity prices. We evaluate the accuracy of the price forecasting attained with the proposed neural network approach, reporting the results from the electricity markets of mainland Spain and California. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"Chen X., Dong Z.Y., Meng K., Xu Y., Wong K.P., Ngan H.W.",Electricity price forecasting with extreme learning machine and bootstrapping,2012,156.0,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely applied in electricity price forecasts due to their nonlinear modeling capabilities. However, it is well known that in general, traditional training methods for ANNs such as back-propagation (BP) approach are normally slow and it could be trapped into local optima. In this paper, a fast electricity market price forecast method is proposed based on a recently emerged learning method for single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks, the extreme learning machine (ELM), to overcome these drawbacks. The new approach also has improved price intervals forecast accuracy by incorporating bootstrapping method for uncertainty estimations. Case studies based on chaos time series and Australian National Electricity Market price series show that the proposed method can effectively capture the nonlinearity from the highly volatile price data series with much less computation time compared with other methods.

"Wan C., Xu Z., Wang Y., Dong Z.Y., Wong K.P.",A hybrid approach for probabilistic forecasting of electricity price,2014,121.0,"The electricity market plays a key role in realizing the economic prophecy of smart grids. Accurate and reliable electricity market price forecasting is essential to facilitate various decision making activities of market participants in the future smart grid environment. However, due to the nonstationarities involved in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather difficult to accurately predict MCPs in advance. The challenge is getting intensified as more and more renewable energy and other new technologies emerged in smart grids. Therefore transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts can be of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts, thus effectively supporting the decision making activities against uncertainties and risks ahead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to construct prediction intervals of MCPs with a two-stage formulation. In the first stage, extreme learning machine (ELM) is applied to estimate point forecasts of MCPs and model uncertainties involved. In the second stage, the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the noise variance. A generalized and comprehensive evaluation framework for probabilistic electricity price forecasting is proposed in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method has been validated through comprehensive tests using real price data from Australian electricity market. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial neural network; bootstrap; electricity price forecasting; maximum likelihood estimation; prediction intervals,Australian electricity market; bootstrap; Comprehensive evaluation; Electricity price forecasting; Extreme learning machine; Maximum likelihood methods; Prediction interval; Probabilistic forecasting; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Electric industry; Electric load forecasting; Maximum likelihood estimation; Neural networks; Smart power grids; Uncertainty analysis; Forecasting,5,1,1,2,Article,1,b
Pao H.-T.,Forecasting electricity market pricing using artificial neural networks,2007,119.0,"Electricity price forecasting is extremely important for all market players, in particular for generating companies: in the short term, they must set up bids for the spot market; in the medium term, they have to define contract policies; and in the long term, they must define their expansion plans. For forecasting long-term electricity market pricing, in order to avoid excessive round-off and prediction errors, this paper proposes a new artificial neural network (ANN) with single output node structure by using direct forecasting approach. The potentials of ANNs are investigated by employing a rolling cross validation scheme. Out of sample performance evaluated with three criteria across five forecasting horizons shows that the proposed ANNs are a more robust multi-step ahead forecasting method than autoregressive error models.

"Motamedi A., Zareipour H., Rosehart W.D.",Electricity price and demand forecasting in smart grids,2012,112.0,"In future smart grids, consumers of electricity will be enabled to react to electricity prices. The aggregate reaction of consumers can potentially shift the demand curve in the market, resulting in prices that may differ from the initial forecasts. In this paper, a hybrid forecasting framework is proposed that takes such dynamics into account when forecasting electricity price and demand. The proposed framework combines a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) forecasting engine for joint price and demand prediction with data association mining (DAM) algorithms. In this framework, a DAM-based rule extraction mechanism is used to determine and extract the patterns in consumers' reaction to price forecasts. The extracted rules are then employed to fine-tune the initially generated demand and price forecasts of a MIMO engine.

"Lu X., Dong Z.Y., Li X.",Electricity market price spike forecast with data mining techniques,2005,88.0,"Electricity market price forecast is a changeling yet very important task for electricity market managers and participants. Due to the complexity and uncertainties in the power grid, electricity prices are highly volatile and normally carry with spikes, which may be tens or even hundreds of times higher than the normal price. Such electricity spikes are very difficult to be predicted. So far, most of the research on electricity price forecast is based on the normal range electricity prices. This paper proposes a data mining based electricity price forecast framework, which can predict the normal price as well as the price spikes. The normal price can be predicted by a previously proposed wavelet and neural network based forecast model, while the spikes are forecasted based on a data mining approach. This paper focuses on the spike prediction and explores the reasons for price spikes based on the measurement of a proposed composite supply-demand balance index (SDI) and relative demand index (RDI). These indices are able to reflect the relationship among electricity demand, electricity supply and electricity reserve capacity. The proposed model is based on a mining database including market clearing price, trading hour, electricity demand, electricity supply and reserve. Bayesian classification and similarity searching techniques are used to mine the database to find out the internal relationships between electricity price spikes and these proposed. The mining results are used to form the price spike forecast model. This proposed model is able to generate forecasted price spike, level of spike and associated forecast confidence level. The model is tested with the Queensland electricity market data with promising results. Crown Copyright © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the performance of a novel neural network technique called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in the price forecasting problem. Keeping in view the risk associated with electricity markets with highly volatile prices, relying on a single technique is not so profitable. Therefore ELM has been coupled with the Wavelet technique to develop a hybrid model termed as WELM (wavelet based ELM) to improve the forecasting accuracy as well as reliability. In this way, the unique features of each tool are combined to capture different patterns in the data. The robustness of the model is further enhanced using the ensembling technique.

Among many properties, a successful prediction tool should be able to capture long-term dependencies in market's historical data. A nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (NARX) has proven to enjoy a superior performance to capture such dependencies than other learning machines. However, it is not examined for electricity price forecasting so far. In this paper, we have employed a NARX network for forecasting electricity prices. Our prediction model is then compared with two currently used methods, namely the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and wavelet neural network. All the models are built on the reconstructed state space of market's historical data, which either improves the results or decreases the complexity of learning algorithms. Here, we also criticize the one-step ahead forecasts for electricity price that may suffer a one-term delay and we explain why the mean square error criterion does not guarantee a functional prediction result in this case. To tackle the problem, we pursue multi-step ahead predictions. Results for the Ontario electricity market are presented. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a novel hybrid methodology for electricity price forecasting is introduced and applied on a set of real-world historical data taken from the New England area. The proposed approach is implemented in two steps. In the first step, a set of relevance vector machines (RVMs) is adopted, where each RVM is used for individual ahead-of-time price prediction. In the second step, individual predictions are aggregated to formulate a linear regression ensemble, whose coefficients are obtained as the solution of a single objective optimization problem. Thus, an optimal solution to the problem is found by employing the micro-genetic algorithm and the optimized ensemble is employed for computing the final price forecast. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared with performance of autoregressive-moving-average and naïve forecasting methods, as well as to that taken from each individual RVM.

"Amjady N., Daraeepour A.",Mixed price and load forecasting of electricity markets by a new iterative prediction method,2009,48.0,"Load and price forecasting are the two key issues for the participants of current electricity markets. However, load and price of electricity markets have complex characteristics such as nonlinearity, non-stationarity and multiple seasonality, to name a few (usually, more volatility is seen in the behavior of electricity price signal). For these reasons, much research has been devoted to load and price forecast, especially in the recent years. However, previous research works in the area separately predict load and price signals. In this paper, a mixed model for load and price forecasting is presented, which can consider interactions of these two forecast processes. The mixed model is based on an iterative neural network based prediction technique. It is shown that the proposed model can present lower forecast errors for both load and price compared with the previous separate frameworks. Another advantage of the mixed model is that all required forecast features (from load or price) are predicted within the model without assuming known values for these features. So, the proposed model can better be adapted to real conditions of an electricity market. The forecast accuracy of the proposed mixed method is evaluated by means of real data from the New York and Spanish electricity markets.

The main idea is to develop a new training or identification stage in a nonlinear chaotic dynamic based predictor. In the training stage five optimal parameters for a chaotic based predictor are searched through an optimization model based on evolutionary strategy. The objective function of the optimization model is the mismatch minimization between the multi-step-ahead forecasting of predictor and observed data such as it is done in identification problems. The first contribution of this paper is that the proposed approach is capable of capturing the complex dynamic of demand and price time series considered resulting in a more accuracy forecasting. The second contribution is that the proposed approach run on-line manner, i.e. the optimal set of parameters and prediction is executed automatically which can be used to prediction in real-time, it is an advantage in comparison with other models, where the choice of their input parameters are carried out off-line, following qualitative/experience-based recipes.

"Amjady N., Keynia F.",Electricity market price spike analysis by a hybrid data model and feature selection technique,2010,40.0,"In a competitive electricity market, energy price forecasting is an important activity for both suppliers and consumers. For this reason, many techniques have been proposed to predict electricity market prices in the recent years. However, electricity price is a complex volatile signal owning many spikes. Most of electricity price forecast techniques focus on the normal price prediction, while price spike forecast is a different and more complex prediction process. Price spike forecasting has two main aspects: prediction of price spike occurrence and value. In this paper, a novel technique for price spike occurrence prediction is presented composed of a new hybrid data model, a novel feature selection technique and an efficient forecast engine. The hybrid data model includes both wavelet and time domain variables as well as calendar indicators, comprising a large candidate input set. The set is refined by the proposed feature selection technique evaluating both relevancy and redundancy of the candidate inputs. The forecast engine is a probabilistic neural network, which are fed by the selected candidate inputs of the feature selection technique and predict price spike occurrence. The efficiency of the whole proposed method for price spike occurrence forecasting is evaluated by means of real data from the Queensland and PJM electricity markets. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Work presented in this paper is an extended version of previous works done by the authors to integrate ANN and SD method for predicting electricity price. The focus here is on sensitivity analysis of SD parameters while keeping the parameters same for ANN to forecast hourly electricity prices in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) (regional transmission organization in northeast America) electricity market. Several cases are simulated by choosing (a) two, (b) three, (c) four, and (d) five SD parameters to calculate the norm. In addition, sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the time framework of SD (d = 15, 30, 45, 60) and the number of selected similar price days (N = 5, 10). From sensitivity analysis, it is identified that the optimized mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is obtained using case-c with d = 30 and N = 10. MAPE of reasonably small value, along with forecast mean square error and mean absolute error of around 2$/MWh and 1$/MWh, is obtained for the PJM data, which has correlation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7758 between load and electricity price.

Hence, this paper proposes a new hybrid evolutionary-adaptive methodology for electricity prices forecasting in the short-term, i.e., between 24 and 168 h ahead, successfully combining mutual information, wavelet transform, evolutionary particle swarm optimization, and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. In order to determine the accuracy, competence and proficiency of the proposed methodology, results from real-world case studies using real data are presented, together with a thorough comparison considering the results obtained with previously reported forecasting tools.

"Zhao J.H., Dong Z.Y., Li X.",Electricity market price spike forecasting and decision making,2007,33.0,"Forecasting price spikes is a timely issue for the deregulated electricity market. Traditional price forecasting techniques show poor performance in handling price spikes, which usually follow a pattern different from the prices under normal market conditions. Therefore, novel approaches are required to forecast both the occurrences and values of spikes. In this paper a comprehensive study is conducted to investigate the performance of several data mining techniques for spike forecasting. Another major contribution of this paper is that a novel approach is proposed to integrate the spike forecasting process with decision-making, and to provide a comprehensive risk management tool against spikes. This approach is based on the Naïve Bayesian Classifier. The benefits/costs of possible decisions are considered in the spike forecasting process to achieve the maximum benefits from the decisions against price spikes.

Moreover, various prediction approaches based on extreme learning machine (ELM) have been identified as effective on normal decision space. Especially, evolutionary extreme learning machine (E-ELM) may obtain better solution quality. However, in high dimensional space, E-ELM is time-consuming because it is difficult to converge into optimal region when just relied on stochastic searching approaches. In addition, due to the complex functional relationship is often complicated, the objective function of E-ELM seems hard to be mined directly for obtaining useful mathematical information to guide the optimum exploring. This paper proposes a new differential evolution (DE)-like algorithm to enhance E-ELM for more accurate and reliable prediction of electricity price. The approximation model for producing DE-like trail vector is the key mechanism, which may use simpler mathematical mapping to replace the original yet complicated functional relationship within a small region. Thus, the evolutionary procedure frequently guided by rational searching directions may make the E-ELM more robust and faster than supported only by those stochastic methods. Several benchmarks are applied to test the performances of the proposed algorithm and the experimental results have shown that the new method can improve the performance of E-ELM. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Approximation model; Differential evolution; Electricity price prediction; Extreme learning machine,Benchmarking; Costs; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Functions; Knowledge acquisition; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Approximation model; Differential Evolution; Electricity prices; Extreme learning machine; Functional relationship; High dimensional spaces; Mathematical information; Stochastic searching; Learning systems,5,1,1,1,Article,1,b

"Srinivasan D., Fen C.Y., Ah C.L.",Electricity price forecasting using evolved neural networks,2007,8.0,"Evolutionary techniques have capabilities of efficient search space exploration with population models corresponding to the problem. Their ability to capture the non linear dependencies among the system variables has invited economic analysts towards their use in the field of financial time series prediction. Although simple neural networks with sufficient number neuron units in the hidden layer are capable of following dynamics of any deterministic system, the weight search space becomes too complex to be searched using a simple back propagation based training algorithm. This paper presents and evaluates two alternative methods for finding the optimum weights of a neural network to capture the chaotic dynamics of electricity price data. The first method uses evolutionary algorithm to evolve a neural network, and the second method uses Particle Swarm Optimization for NN training.

Back propagation algorithm is used for training the wavelet neural network for prediction. Weights in the back propagation algorithm are usually initialised with small random values. If the random initial weights happen to be far from a suitable solution or near a poor local optimum, training may take a long time or get trapped in the local optimum. In this paper, we show that WNN has acceptable prediction properties compared to other forecasting techniques. We investigated proper weight initialisations of WNN, and proved that it attains a superior prediction performance. Finally, we used a two-step correlation analysis algorithm for input selecting.

As a consequence, forecasting problems are becoming more and more challenging and ridden with uncertainty. Such uncertainties are generally quantified by statistical tools such as prediction intervals (Pis). Pis quantify the uncertainty related to forecasts by estimating the ranges of the targeted quantities. Pis generated by traditional neural network based approaches are limited by high computational burden and impractical assumptions about the distribution of the data. A novel technique for constructing high quality Pis using support vector machines (SVMs) is being proposed in this paper. The proposed technique directly estimates the upper and lower bounds of the PI in a short time and without any assumptions about the data distribution. The SVM parameters are tuned using particle swarm optimization technique by minimization of a modified Pi-based objective function.

Inaccurate price forecasting may cause energy waste and management chaos in the electricity market. However, electricity price forecasting has always been regarded as one of the largest challenges in the electricity market because it shows high volatility, which makes electricity price forecasting difficult. This paper proposes the use of artificial intelligence optimization combination forecasting models based on preprocessing data, called ""chaos particles optimization (CPSO) weight-determined combination models.""

The accuracy of forecasting electricity price can ensure that consumers minimize their electricity costs and make producers maximize their profits and avoid volatility. However, the fluctuation of electricity price depends on other commodities and there is a very complicated randomization in its evolution process. Therefore, in recent years, although large number of forecasting methods have been proposed and researched in this domain, it is very difficult to forecast electricity price with only one traditional model for different behaviors of electricity price. In this paper, we propose an optimized combined forecasting model by ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) based on the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and support vector machine (SVM) to improve the forecasting accuracy. First, both GARCH model and SVM are developed to forecast short-term electricity price of New South Wales in Australia. Then, ACO algorithm is applied to determine the weight coefficients.

Although a number of forecasting methods have been proposed to solve the shortterm and long-term electricity load forecast, pool-price forecasting is a relatively new research area. In this article, we propose an autoregressive approach, based on a wavelet multiscale decomposition, for the prediction of one-hour ahead load and pool price based respectively on historical electricity load, and pool-price data. This approach is based on a multiple resolution decomposition of the signal using the redundant Haar à trous wavelet transform whose advantage is taking into account the asymmetric nature of the time-varying data. There is an additional computational advantage in that there is no need to re-compute the wavelet transform (wavelet coefficients) of the full signal if the electricity and pool price data (time series) is regularly updated. We assess results produced by this multiscale autoregressive method, in both linear and nonlinear variants, with single resolution autoregressive, multilayer perceptron, Elman recurrent neural network and the general regression neural network models. The input data consists of historical load and pool price data, which is collected over a period of 3 years (1999-2001), used for training, and 1 year (2002) used for testing.

To verify the validity of the proposed electricity price prediction model in this paper, five comparison approaches based on the B-N-D approach were selected, which are autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), single LSSVM, LSSVM optimized by the fruit-fly optimization algorithm (FOA), LSSVM optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) models, and WOA-LSSVM without B-N-D. By comparatively analyzing the error criteria values of the above models through testing on the objective data of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) electricity market collected from 11 December 2017 to 18 December 2017, from 15 January 2018 to 22 January 2018, and from 1 February 2018 to 25 February 2018, we conclude that the constructed intelligent model in this paper can greatly enhance the prediction precision of electricity prices. © 2018 by the authors.",Beveridge-Nelson decomposition approach; Electricity price prediction; Least square support vector machine; Multi-stage intelligent model; Whale optimization algorithm,accuracy assessment; algorithm; electricity generation; electricity industry; least squares method; numerical model; optimization; prediction; Maryland; New Jersey; Pennsylvania; United States; Cetacea,5,1,1,1,Article,4,

"Boma K., Palizdar S.",Short time price forecasting for electricity market based on hybrid fuzzy wavelet transform and bacteria foraging algorithm,2016,,"Predicting the price of electricity is very important because electricity can not be stored. To this end, parallel methods and adaptive regression have been used in the past. But because dependence on the ambient temperature, there was no good result. In this study, linear prediction methods and neural networks and fuzzy logic have been studied and emulated. An optimized fuzzy-wavelet prediction method is proposed to predict the price of electricity. In this method, in order to have a better prediction, the membership functions of the fuzzy regression along with the type of the wavelet transform filter have been optimized using the E.Coli Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm. Then, to better compare this optimal method with other prediction methods including conventional linear prediction and neural network methods, they were analyzed with the same electricity price data. In fact, our fuzzy-wavelet method has a more desirable solution than previous methods. More precisely by choosing a suitable filter and a multiresolution processing method, the maximum error has improved by 13.6%, and the mean squared error has improved about 17.9%. In comparison with the fuzzy prediction method, our proposed method has a higher computational volume due to the use of wavelet transform as well as double use of fuzzy prediction. Due to the large number of layers and neurons used in it, the neural network method has a much higher computational volume than our fuzzy-wavelet method.",Bacteria foraging algorithm; Electricity market; Fuzzy logic; Price prediction; Wavelet transform,,5,1,1,1,Article,3,

Dash S.K.,A hybrid ARMA-Legendre polynomial neural network and evolutionary H-infinity filter for the prediction of electricity market clearing price,2015,,"A hybrid adaptive autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and Legendre polynomial neural network trained by an evolutionary H-infinity filter is presented in this paper for predicting short-Term electricity prices in a deregulated market. The proposed model comprises a linear autoregressive (AR) part and nonlinear moving average (MA) part obtained through the use of Legendre polynomial basis functions. The Legendre polynomial functional block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher dimensional space through basis functions without using any hidden layer like the multilayered perceptron (MLP) network. Instead of using the standard forward-backward (FB-LMS) algorithm for learning the weight parameters of the ARMALEG (hybrid ARMA and Legendre network) a robust H-infinity filter is used which is superior to the widely used extended Kalman filter in terms of handling uncertain noise covariances resulting in fast convergence and tracking. Further to improve the accuracy, the H-infinity filter parameters are optimised using a differential evolution (DE) strategy. The proposed method is tested on PJM electricity market and the residuals (MAPE) are compared with other forecasting methods indicating the improved accuracy of the approach and its suitability to produce a real-Time forecast.

"Voronin S., Partanen J.","Forecasting electricity price and demand using a hybrid approach based on wavelet transform, ARIMA and neural networks",2014,43.0,"Demand and price forecasting are extremely important for participants in energy markets. Most research work in the area predicts demand and price signals separately. In this paper, a model is presented which predicts electricity demand and price simultaneously. The model combines wavelet transforms, ARIMA models and neural networks. Both time domain and wavelet domain variables are considered in the feature set for price and demand forecasting. The best input set is selected by two-step correlation analysis. The proposed model is better adapted to real conditions of an energy market since the forecast features for price and demand are not assumed as known values but are predicted by the model, thus accounting for the interactions of the demand and price forecast processes. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using data from the Finnish energy market, which is part of the Nordic Power Pool.
